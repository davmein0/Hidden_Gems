Item 3. Legal Proceedings
From time to time, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, as of the date of this Annual Report, we do not believe we are party to any claim or litigation the outcome of which, if determined adversely to us, would individually or in the aggregate be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.

Overview
We are a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and delivery of innovative medicines for the treatment of serious diseases in which signaling by protein growth factors plays a fundamental role. As a global leader in transforming growth factor beta (“TGFβ”) superfamily biology, our novel understanding of the molecular mechanisms of growth factor activation enabled us to develop a proprietary platform for the discovery and development of monoclonal antibodies that locally and selectively target the precursor, or latent, forms of growth factors. By targeting the signaling proteins at the cellular level and acting in the disease microenvironment, we believe we may avoid the historical dose-limiting safety challenges associated with inhibiting growth factors for therapeutic effect. We believe our focus on biologically validated growth factors may facilitate a more efficient development path.
Based on this proprietary and scalable technology platform, we are building a growing portfolio of novel product candidates with the aim of transforming the lives of patients suffering from a wide range of serious diseases, including neuromuscular disorders, cardiometabolic disorders, cancer, fibrosis and iron-restricted anemia. We have discovered and progressed the development of:
●
Apitegromab, an investigational, fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits myostatin activation by selectively binding the pro- and latent forms of myostatin in skeletal muscle and is being developed for the treatment of SMA. We also believe apitegromab could have potential in the treatment of other neuromuscular disorders where the inhibition of myostatin may be beneficial. 
●
SRK-439, a novel, preclinical, investigational myostatin inhibitor that has high in vitro affinity for pro- and latent myostatin and maintains myostatin specificity and is being developed for the treatment of cardiometabolic disorders.
●
SRK-181, an investigational inhibitor of the activation of latent TGFβ1, that is being developed for the treatment of cancers that are resistant to anti-PD-(L)1 antibody therapies.
●
SRK-373, a novel, preclinical, investigational TGFβ inhibitor that selectively inhibits the activation of latent TGFβ1 isoform in the context of fibrotic extracellular matrix and that avoids perturbing TGFβ1 presented by cells of the immune system and is being developed for the treatment of fibrotic diseases.

Table of Contents
●
SRK-256, a novel, preclinical, investigational inhibitor that selectively inhibits RGMc or hemojuvelin, the co-receptor of bone morphogenic protein 6 (“BMP6”) and hence inhibits BMP6 signaling. BMP6 signaling is critical for iron homeostasis and SRK-256 has wide potential applicability in states of iron-restricted anemias.
​
●
Additional discovery and early preclinical programs related to the selective modulation of growth factor signaling.
​
Our first product candidate, apitegromab, is a highly selective, fully human, monoclonal antibody, with a unique mechanism of action that results in inhibition of the activation of the growth factor, myostatin, in skeletal muscle. Apitegromab is being developed as a potential first muscle-targeted therapy for the treatment of SMA. We completed SAPPHIRE, a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apitegromab in patients with nonambulatory Type 2 and Type 3 SMA (which is estimated to represent the majority of the current prevalent SMA patient population in the U.S. and Europe) and announced positive top-line results in October 2024. The study achieved its primary endpoint. We submitted a U.S. Biologics License Application to the FDA in January 2025 and are planning to submit a European Union marketing authorization application to the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) in the first quarter of 2025. If apitegromab is approved, we expect to initiate a commercial product launch in the fourth quarter of 2025 in the United States, with a commercial launch of apitegromab in Europe to follow. 
Apitegromab was evaluated in our Phase 2 TOPAZ proof-of-concept clinical trial for the treatment of patients with Type 2 and Type 3 SMA. Positive 12-month top-line results were initially announced in April 2021. We have subsequently presented data from the TOPAZ trial over 24-months (2022), 36-months (2023) and 48-months (2024). At 48-months over 90% of TOPAZ patients with nonambulatory Type 2 and 3 SMA receiving a survival motor neuron (“SMN”) therapy remained on apitegromab treatment and showed sustained clinical benefit, a continued favorable safety profile with no new safety findings. Additionally, we are conducting a long-term extension study, ONYX, for patients from both the TOPAZ and SAPPHIRE studies, who were receiving apitegromab in conjunction with an approved SMN therapy. The FDA granted Fast Track designation, Rare Pediatric Disease designation and Orphan Drug designation to apitegromab for the treatment of SMA in May 2021, August 2020 and March 2018, respectively. The EMA granted Priority Medicines (“PRIME”) designation in March 2021 and the EC granted orphan medicinal product designation in December 2018 to apitegromab for the treatment of SMA.
In October 2023, we announced an expansion of our therapeutic focus into cardiometabolic disorders by advancing our anti-myostatin program with SRK-439, a novel, fully human anti-myostatin monoclonal antibody, for evaluation in cardiometabolic disorders, including obesity. We are developing SRK-439 towards a potential IND submission in the third quarter of 2025. In 2024, we presented preclinical data at scientific conferences which support the potential of SRK-439 to increase lean mass and contribute to a favorable body composition in conjunction with a GLP-1 receptor agonist (“GLP-1 RA”) treatment. To inform the development of SRK-439, in May 2024 we initiated the Phase 2 EMBRAZE proof-of-concept trial, designed to assess the safety and efficacy of apitegromab to preserve muscle mass in individuals living with obesity and on background therapy of a GLP-1 RA. In September 2024, we announced that we completed enrollment in the Phase 2 EMRAZE proof-of-concept trial. Top-line results from this trial are expected in the second quarter of 2025.
​
We believe that apitegromab has the potential to be the first muscle-targeted therapy that is aimed at improving motor function in patients with SMA who are receiving an SMN therapy. We also have identified multiple other diseases for which the selective inhibition of the activation of myostatin may offer therapeutic benefit, including additional patient populations in SMA (such as patients with SMA under 2 years of age) and indications for other neuromuscular disorders beyond SMA.
Our second product candidate, SRK-181,
 a highly selective inhibitor of the activation of latent TGFβ,
 is being developed for the treatment of cancers that are resistant to CPI therapies, such as anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibody therapies (referred to together as anti-PD-(L)1 antibody therapies). 
SRK-181 is being evaluated in our Phase 1 DRAGON proof-of-concept clinical trial in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors that exhibit resistance to anti-PD-(L)1 antibody therapies. We completed enrollment of the DRAGON trial in December 2023 and continue to treat patients who remain on study
. This two-part clinical trial consists of a dose escalation portion (Part A) and a dose expansion portion evaluating SRK-181 in combination with an approved anti-PD-(L)1 antibody therapy (Part B). 
Part B

Table of Contents
commenced in 2021 and includes the following active cohorts: urothelial carcinoma, cutaneous melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, ccRCC, and HNSCC.
 Safety, efficacy and biomarker data were presented in June 2024 at the ASCO annual meeting and in November 2024 at the SITC 39
th
 Annual Meeting. 
The data showed encouraging responses in heavily pretreated and anti-PD-(L)1 resistant patients across multiple tumor types.

We believe that the 
DRAGON trial achieved its study objectives by showing objective, durable clinical responses in patients with ccRCC resistant to PD-1 therapy above what is expected from continuing PD-1 alone. We anticipate that 
emerging data from the DRAGON trial will be presented at medical meetings in the future.
​
Using our innovative
 approach and proprietary platform, we are creating a pipeline of novel product candidates that selectively modulate the activation of growth factors implicated in a variety of serious diseases, including neuromuscular disorders, cardiometabolic disorders, cancer, fibrosis, and iron-restricted anemia. 
Our proprietary platform is designed to generate highly selective antibodies that target the growth factor’s latent precursor form prior to its activation within the disease microenvironment, or tissue where it is localized.

Our structural insights and unique antibody discovery capabilities can also be applied to other protein classes beyond growth factors, with an aim of generating differentiated candidates targeting cell surface receptors such as immune cell receptors or G-protein coupled receptors, where selectivity remains challenging.
​
We have incurred significant operating losses since inception. Our net losses were $246.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $922.7 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future in performing our ongoing activities, as we:
●
develop our commercialization capabilities to support product sales, marketing and distribution activities; 
●
continue development activities for apitegromab, including the completion of our Phase 3 SAPPHIRE pivotal clinical trial in SMA, the conduct of ONYX, our long-term extension study for patients from both the TOPAZ and SAPPHIRE studies and the associated drug supply;
●
continue research and development activities for SRK-181, including the conduct of our Phase 1 DRAGON proof-of-concept clinical trial;
●
continue research and development activities for our cardiometabolic program, including our Phase 2 EMBRAZE proof-of-concept trial with apitegromab and advancing SRK-439 towards a potential IND submission in the third quarter of 2025;
●
continue to discover, validate and develop additional product candidates through the use of our proprietary platform;
●
maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;
●
hire additional research, development, commercial and other business personnel; and
●
continue to build the infrastructure to support our operations as a public company.
​
To date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales. If we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for apitegromab, SRK-181, SRK-439 or any of our future product candidates, we may generate revenue in the future from product sales. In addition, if we obtain regulatory approval for apitegromab, SRK-181, SRK-439 or any of our future product candidates, we expect to incur significant expenses related to developing our commercialization capabilities to support product sales, marketing and distribution activities.

Financial Operations Overview
Operating Expenses
Research and Development
Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research and development activities, including our product candidate discovery efforts, preclinical studies, manufacturing, and clinical trials under our research programs, which include:
●
employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and equity-based compensation expense for our research and development personnel;
●
expenses incurred under agreements with third parties that conduct research and development and preclinical activities on our behalf;
●
expenses incurred under agreements related to our clinical trials, including the costs for investigative sites and contract research organizations (“CROs”), that conduct our clinical trials
;
●
manufacturing process-development, manufacturing of clinical supplies and technology-transfer expenses
;
●
consulting and professional fees related to research and development activities;
●
costs of purchasing laboratory supplies and non-capital equipment used in our internal research and development activities;
●
costs related to compliance with clinical regulatory requirements; and
●
facility costs and other allocated expenses, which include expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance, depreciation and other supplies.
​
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Costs for certain activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks. Nonrefundable advance payments for research and development goods and services to be received in the future from third parties are deferred and capitalized. The capitalized amounts are expensed as the related services are performed.
A significant portion of our research and development costs have been external costs, which we track on a program-by-program basis after a clinical product candidate has been identified. However, we do not allocate our internal research and development expenses, consisting primarily of employee-related costs, depreciation and other indirect costs, on a program-by-program basis as they are deployed across multiple projects.
Research and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials, as well as the associated clinical trial material requirements. We expect research and development costs for our product candidates to continue to be substantial for the foreseeable future as the development programs progress. However, we do not believe that it is possible at this time to accurately project total program-specific expenses through commercialization. There are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of any of our product candidates, including future trial design and various regulatory requirements, many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time based on our stage of development. Additionally, future commercial and regulatory factors beyond our control will impact our clinical development programs and plans. 
The successful development of apitegromab, SRK-181, SRK-439, SRK-373, SRK-256 and any future product candidates is uncertain. Accordingly, at this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of apitegromab, SRK-181, SRK-439, SRK-373, SRK-256 and any future product candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, 
113

Table of Contents
material net cash inflows will commence from the sale of our product candidates, if approved. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing product candidates, including the uncertainty of:
●
the scope, progress, outcome and costs of our preclinical development activities, clinical trials and other research and development activities;
●
establishing an appropriate safety profile;
●
successful enrollment in and completion of clinical trials;
●
whether our product candidates show safety and efficacy in our clinical trials;
●
receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities, if any;
●
establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers;
●
obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates;
●
significant and changing government regulation;
●
commercializing the product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; and
●
continued acceptable safety profile of the products following any regulatory approval.
A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of apitegromab, SRK-181, SRK-439, SRK-373, SRK-256 or any of our future product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and equity-based compensation expenses for personnel in executive, finance, business development, investor relations, legal, information technology, human resources and commercial functions. Other significant general and administrative expenses include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, legal fees relating to patent and corporate matters and fees for accounting, consulting services, professional fees and corporate expenses. We expect general and administrative expense to increase as we continue to invest in building the infrastructure to support the commercialization of apitegromab.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, partially offset by interest expense incurred on our debt facility, including amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs

The increase in research and development expense was primarily attributable to the following:
●
An increase in our external research and development costs of $42.2 million, which primarily consisted of: 
o
$37.6 million increase in costs associated with apitegromab
 primarily due to clinical trial costs, particularly the conduct of 
ONYX, our long-term extension study for patients from both the TOPAZ and SAPPHIRE studies and our Phase 2 EMBRAZE proof-of-concept study (including purchases of 
115

Table of Contents
GLP-1 RA drug), as well as an increase in drug supply manufacturing, including to support lifecycle management initiatives; 
o
$4.2 million decrease in costs associated with SRK-181 mostly 
due to purchases of pembrolizumab in 2023 which were used in the Phase 1 DRAGON clinical trial;

o
$11.0 million increase in preclinical costs and manufacturing development for SRK-439; and
o
$2.1 million decrease in costs in other early development candidates and unallocated costs;
●
$20.4 
million increase in internal research and development costs, which was primarily driven by an increase in employee related costs, including salaries, benefits and non-cash equity-based compensation expense related to increased headcount, as well as an increase in temporary support expense.
Total research and development expenses are expected to continue to be substantial, driven by employee compensation costs and development costs associated with our clinical stage programs as we continue 
development activities for apitegromab in SMA,
 including the completion of our Phase 3 SAPPHIRE pivotal clinical trial in SMA, the conduct of ONYX, our long-term extension study for patients from both the TOPAZ and SAPPHIRE studies and the associated drug supply, as well as costs associated with supporting our cardiometabolic program, including our Phase 2 EMBRAZE proof-of-concept trial of apitegromab and our preclinical program, SRK-439. Additionally, we will continue to invest in our pipeline. We expect costs of our SRK-181 program to decrease, as we completed enrollment of the Phase 1 DRAGON clinical trial in December 2023.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expense was $67.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $49.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $18.1 million or 36.7%. The increase was primarily 
associated with employee-related costs including salaries, benefits and non-cash equity-based compensation expense related to increased headcount, in addition to an increase in professional service fees. We expect general and administrative expense to increase as we continue to invest in building the infrastructure to support the commercialization of apitegromab
.
Other Income (Expense), Net
The change in other income (expense), net was primarily attributable to an increase in interest income earned due to higher interest rates and higher average balances in our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, partially offset by an increase in interest expense related to the Loan and Security Agreement, also due to higher interest rates
.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources of Liquidity
Since our inception, we have not generated any product revenue and have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from our operations. We have funded our operations to date primarily with proceeds from the sale of our convertible preferred stock and units in private placements before our IPO, and issuance of our common stock through our IPO in 2018, to Gilead in an exempt private placement, through multiple secondary public offerings, including our recent follow-on offering in October 2024 (see Note 9) and through at-the-market (“ATM”) sales, as well as payments from our research collaborations and the Loan and Security Agreement entered into in October 2020 and subsequently amended (see Note 13).

During the year ended December 31, 2024, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance increased by $157.3 million. The change was primarily the result of proceeds from our equity offering completed in October 2024 and exercises of stock options and warrants, partially offset by cash used to operate our business, including payments related to, among other things, research and development and general and administrative expenses as we continued to invest in our product candidates and supported our internal research and development efforts and made interest payments on our debt. 
Our current ATM program, established in November 2022, allows for the sale of shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $100 million. As of December 31, 2024, we sold 619,290 shares of our common stock, generating net proceeds of $5.2 million, under the ATM program. No sales were made under the ATM program during the year ended December 31, 2024. In October 2021, we sold 500,000 shares of our common stock through a sale in our prior ATM program (in place between March 2021 and June 2022) and received $13.1 million in net proceeds, after deducting commissions and fees.
​
We have had multiple equity offerings during the period 2019-2024. The most recent few are listed below:
​
In October 2024, we entered into an underwriting agreement with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Jefferies LLC and Piper Sandler & Co., as representatives of the several underwriters named therein, relating to the issuance and sale of an aggregate of 11,858,408 shares of our common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase 353,983 shares of our common stock, which includes the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase an additional 1,592,920 shares. The offering price per share was $28.25 and the offering price per pre-funded warrant was $28.2499, which equals the per share public offering price for the common shares less the $0.0001 exercise price for each such pre-funded warrant. The offering resulted in estimated proceeds of approximately $324.4 million, net of underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses (see Note 9).
​
In October 2023, we entered into an underwriting agreement with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Piper Sandler & Co., as representatives of the several underwriters named therein, relating to the issuance and sale of an aggregate of 14,270,074 shares of our common stock, which includes the exercise in full by the underwriters of their options to purchase an additional 1,861,314 shares. The offering price per share was $6.85. The offering resulted in proceeds of approximately $92.4 million, net of underwriting discounts and offering expenses.

On February 10, 2025, we entered into the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement with Oxford for up to $200 million of which $25.0 million from Tranche 1 was received in October 2020 and $25.0 million from Tranche 2 was received in December 2021 (see Note 13). The Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement consolidates the existing outstanding loan tranches solely with Oxford.

In December 2018, we entered into the Gilead Collaboration Agreement pursuant to which we conducted research and preclinical development activities relating to the diagnosis, treatment, cure, mitigation or prevention of diseases, disorders or conditions, other than in the field of oncology in accordance with a pre-determined research plan. Pursuant to the Gilead Collaboration Agreement, Gilead made non-refundable payments of $80.0 million, including an upfront payment and an equity investment. In December 2019, we achieved a $25.0 million preclinical milestone for the successful demonstration of efficacy in preclinical in vivo proof-of-concept studies, and subsequently received the associated payment in January 2020. Revenue was recognized during the period January 2019 through December 2021, as research and development services were provided. All revenue related to the Gilead Collaboration Agreement had been fully recognized by January 31, 2022, upon the termination of Gilead’s option exercise period.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, 2,526,833 of the Company’s pre-funded warrants were exercised. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had 17,362,147 pre-funded warrants outstanding.

Funding Requirements
We expect our expenses to be substantial as we continue the research and development of apitegromab in SMA. In addition, we will seek marketing approval for apitegromab, and if we seek marketing approval for any of our future product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. We expect to continue to incur costs related to SRK-181 as we continue to treat patients who remain on the Phase 1 DRAGON clinical trial. We expect to incur costs to support our cardiometabolic program, including our Phase 2 EMBRAZE proof-of-concept trial of apitegromab and our preclinical program, SRK-439. Additionally, we will support the development of our pipeline and any other preclinical programs. Furthermore, we expect to continue to incur costs associated with operating as a public company.
We expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and cash available to us will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the fourth quarter of 2026. However, we will require additional capital in order to complete clinical development and commercialization for each of our current programs. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:
●
the costs and timing of developing our product candidates and future product candidates, including costs associated with apitegromab in our Phase 3 SAPPHIRE clinical trial in SMA and ONYX, our long-term extension study in SMA for patients from both the TOPAZ and SAPPHIRE studies, our Phase 2 EMBRAZE proof-of-concept trial for apitegromab in our cardiometabolic program, our Phase 1 DRAGON clinical trial for SRK-181, and the costs and timing of conducting future preclinical studies and clinical trials for SRK-439 or any other product candidates;
●
the costs of future manufacturing of apitegromab, SRK-181, SRK-439, SRK-373, SRK-256 and any other future product candidates;
●
the scope, progress, results and costs of discovery, preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for other potential product candidates we may develop, if any;
●
the costs of identifying and developing, or in-licensing or acquiring, additional product candidates and technologies;
●
the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;
●
our ability to establish and maintain collaborations on favorable terms, if at all;
●
the achievement of milestones or occurrence of other developments that trigger payments under any collaboration agreements, license agreements, or other agreements we might have at such time;
●
the costs of seeking marketing approvals for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, including apitegromab in SMA;
●
the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;
●
the amount of revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates, should any of our product candidates receive marketing approval;
●
the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, obtaining, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims;
●
our headcount growth and associated costs as we expand our business operations and research and development activities; 
●
the costs of supporting our infrastructure and facilities, including equipment and physical infrastructure to support our research and development;
●
the costs of operating as a public company; and
●
the impact of adverse global economic conditions on our business, which may exacerbate the magnitude of the factors discussed above.

Table of Contents
Identifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.
Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, common stockholder ownership interests may be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that could adversely affect the rights of a common stockholder. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends, that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.
If we raise funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. Market volatility or other factors could also adversely impact our ability to access capital as and when needed. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.
Critical Accounting Estimates
This management’s discussion and analysis is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our judgments and estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates, if any, will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements prospectively from the date of change in estimates. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report, we believe that the following accounting estimates are those most critical to the judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. They involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our finance condition or result of operations.
Research and Development Expenses and related Accruals/Prepaids
As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel and/or reviewing other third-party sources to identify the progress of services that has been performed on our behalf, as well as invoices received and contracted costs. This contributes to estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. 
The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers 
120

Table of Contents
and make adjustments if necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses include the costs incurred for services performed by our vendors in connection with research and development activities for which we have not yet been invoiced. In certain instances, we prepay for services to be provided in the future. These amounts are expensed as the services are performed.
We base our expenses related to research and development activities on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with vendors that conduct research and development on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid balance accordingly. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made.
Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed, it could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences between our estimates of such expenses and the amounts incurred. 
The accrued research and development expenses at the end of each year are generally paid during the following year and therefore the same estimates and assumptions do not continue to exist each year, although, as described above, the method and procedures to develop those estimates and assumptions are generally consistent. 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
We have reviewed all recently issued standards and have determined that, other than Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements as disclosed in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, such standards will not have a material impact on our financial statements or do not otherwise apply to our operations.

Management’s Evaluation of our Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our

principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.
Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer (principal executive officer) and chief financial officer (principal financial and accounting officer), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon such evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of such date. We continue to review and document our disclosure controls and procedures, including our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting, and may from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that our systems evolve with our business.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a–15(f) and 15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and our Board regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013 (“COSO criteria”). Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. This Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report pursuant to the requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of as we qualify as a “smaller reporting company” and as such, are exempt from such auditor attestation requirement.
Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting
No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the year ended December 31, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Scholar Rock Holding Corporation
​
Opinion on the Financial Statements
​
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Scholar Rock Holding Corporation (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
​
Basis for Opinion
​
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
​
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
​
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
​
Critical Audit Matter
​
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
​
External Prepaid and Accrued Research and Development Expenses
​
​
​
​
Description of the Matter

As shown in Notes 5 and 7 to the financial statements, the Company’s external prepaid research and development expenses and accrued research and development expenses totaled $7.7 million and $12.1 million, respectively, at December 31, 2024. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s accrued and prepaid external research and development expenses are recognized based on various inputs, including an evaluation of the progress achieved to complete specific tasks based on communication with internal and external personnel, open contracts and purchase orders, invoices received, contracted costs, and other information provided to the Company by its service providers based on their actual costs

incurred. Payments for these activities are due based on the terms of individual arrangements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred. Accrued expenses are reflected on the consolidated balance sheet when costs incurred exceed payments made while prepaid expenses are reflected on the consolidated balance sheet when payments made exceed the costs incurred.
​
​
​
​
​
Auditing the Company’s accrued and prepaid external research and development expenses is especially challenging in the context of our audit due to the estimation uncertainty associated with services provided but not yet invoiced. Specifically, the amount of research and development expenses incurred is sensitive to estimates of the progress of the studies, clinical trials or other activities and the associated cost of such services. Additionally, due to the duration of certain of the Company’s ongoing research and development activities and the timing of invoicing received from third parties, the actual amounts incurred may not be known at the time the financial statements are issued, further adding to the estimation uncertainty.
​
​
​
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
​
To test accrued and prepaid external research and development expenses, our audit procedures included, among others, testing the accuracy and completeness of the underlying data used to calculate accrued and prepaid external research and development expenses, as well as evaluating the assumptions and estimates used by management to measure progress of studies, clinical trials or other activities. To assess the extent of services incurred, we assessed the progress of clinical trials with the Company’s research and development personnel that oversee the clinical trials and obtained information from service providers regarding costs incurred to date. We also tested subsequent invoices received and inspected the Company’s contracts with service providers and any pending change orders to assess the effect on the accrued or prepaid external research and development expenses.

SCHOLAR ROCK HOLDING CORPORATION
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
1. Nature of the Business and Basis of Presentation
Organization
Scholar Rock Holding Corporation (the “Company”) is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development, and delivery of innovative medicines for the treatment of serious diseases in which signaling by protein growth factors plays a fundamental role. As a global leader in transforming growth factor beta (“TGFβ”) superfamily biology, the Company’s novel understanding of the molecular mechanisms of growth factor activation enabled the development of a proprietary platform for the discovery and development of monoclonal antibodies that locally and selectively target the precursor, or latent, forms of growth factors. By targeting the signaling proteins at the cellular level and acting in the disease microenvironment, the Company believes that it may avoid the historical dose-limiting safety challenges associated with inhibiting growth factors for therapeutic effect. 
The Company’s first product candidate, apitegromab, is a highly selective, fully human, monoclonal antibody, with a unique mechanism of action that results in inhibition of the activation of the growth factor, myostatin, in skeletal muscle. Apitegromab is being developed as a potential first muscle-targeted therapy for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (“SMA”). The Company completed SAPPHIRE, a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apitegromab in patients with nonambulatory Type 2 and Type 3 SMA and announced positive top-line results in October 2024. The study achieved its primary endpoint. The Company submitted a U.S. Biologics License Application to the FDA in January 2025 and is planning to submit a European Union marketing authorization application to the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) in the first quarter of 2025. If apitegromab is approved, the Company expects to initiate a commercial product launch in the fourth quarter of 2025 in the United States, with a commercial launch of apitegromab in Europe to follow.
 Additionally, in 2024, the Company announced data from the Phase 2 TOPAZ trial extension period which showed patient outcomes at 48 months of treatment with apitegromab. The FDA granted Fast Track designation, Rare Pediatric Disease designation and Orphan Drug designation to apitegromab for the treatment of SMA in May 2021, August 2020 and March 2018, respectively. The EMA granted Priority Medicines (“PRIME”) designation in March 2021 and the EC granted orphan medicinal product designation in December 2018 to apitegromab for the treatment of SMA.
In October 2023, the Company announced an expansion of its therapeutic focus into cardiometabolic disorders by advancing its anti-myostatin program with SRK-439, a novel, fully human anti-myostatin monoclonal antibody, for evaluation in cardiometabolic disorders, including obesity. The Company is developing SRK-439 towards a potential investigational new drug application (“IND”) submission in the third quarter of 2025. To inform the development of SRK-439, in May 2024 the Company initiated the Phase 2 EMBRAZE proof-of-concept trial, designed to assess the safety and efficacy of apitegromab to preserve muscle mass in individuals living with obesity and on background therapy of a GLP-1 receptor agonist (“GLP-1 RA”). In September 2024, the Company announced that it had completed enrollment in the Phase 2 EMRAZE proof-of-concept trial. Top-line results from this trial are expected in the second quarter of 2025.
The Company’s second product candidate, SRK-181, a highly selective inhibitor of the activation of latent TGFβ, is being developed for the treatment of cancers that are resistant to checkpoint inhibitor therapies, such as anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibody therapies (referred to together as anti-PD-(L)1 antibody therapies). SRK-181 is being evaluated in the Company’s Phase 1 DRAGON proof-of-concept clinical trial in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors that exhibit resistance to anti-PD-(L)1 antibody therapies. The Company completed enrollment of the Phase 1 DRAGON trial in December 2023 and continues to treat patients who remain on study. This two-part clinical trial consists of a dose escalation portion (Part A) and a dose expansion portion evaluating SRK-181 in combination with an approved anti-PD-(L)1 antibody therapy (Part B). Part B commenced in 2021 and includes the following active cohorts: urothelial carcinoma, cutaneous melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, clear cell renal cell carcinoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Safety, efficacy and biomarker data were presented in June 2024 at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting and in November 2024 at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer 39th Annual Meeting.

Table of Contents
Additionally, the Company continues to create a pipeline of product candidates to deliver novel therapies to underserved patients suffering from a wide range of serious diseases, including neuromuscular disorders, cardiometabolic disorders, cancer, fibrosis, and iron-restricted anemia. The Company was originally formed in May 2012. Its principal offices are in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
​
Since its inception, the Company’s operations have focused on research and development of monoclonal antibodies that selectively inhibit activation of growth factors for therapeutic effect, as well as establishing the Company’s intellectual property portfolio and performing research and development activities. The Company has primarily financed its operations through various equity financings, including in October 2024 (Note 9), as well as research and development collaboration agreements and the Company’s debt facility (Note 13).
Revenue generation activities have been limited to two collaborations, both containing research services and the issuance of a license. No revenues have been recorded from the sale of any commercial product.
The Company is subject to a number of risks similar to other life science companies, including, but not limited to, successful discovery and development of its drug candidates, raising additional capital, development by its competitors of new technological innovations, protection of proprietary technology and regulatory approval and market acceptance of the Company’s product candidates. The Company anticipates that it will continue to incur significant operating losses for the next several years as it continues to develop its product candidates. The Company believes that its existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at December 31, 2024 will be sufficient to allow the Company to fund its current operations through at least a period of one year after the date these financial statements are issued. 
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Scholar Rock Holding Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). Any reference in these notes to applicable guidance is meant to refer to the authoritative GAAP as found in the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) and Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”).
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the related reporting of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Concentration of Credit Risk and Off-Balance Sheet Risk
The Company has no off-balance sheet risk, such as foreign exchange contracts, option contracts or other foreign-hedging arrangements. The Company follows an investment policy approved by the Board of Directors. Its primary objectives are the preservation of capital and maintenance of liquidity. The Company invests only in fixed income instruments denominated and payable in U.S. dollars including obligations of the U.S. government and its agencies and money market funds registered according to SEC Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940. All securities must have a readily ascertainable market value
, 
must be readily marketable and be U.S. dollar denominated.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash
The Company considers highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates market value. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, cash equivalents include money market funds that invest primarily in U.S. government-backed securities and treasuries. 
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, restricted cash consists of letters of credit related to its leased facility. The following table reconciles cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash per the balance sheet to the statement of cash flows (in thousands):

Marketable Securities
The Company classifies its marketable securities as available-for-sale. Marketable securities with a remaining maturity date greater than one year are classified as non-current if the Company does not intend to utilize the marketable securities to fund current operations. Marketable securities are maintained by an investment manager and consist of U.S. treasury obligations and government agency securities. Marketable securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of stockholders’ equity until realized. Any premium or discount arising at purchase is amortized and/or accreted to interest income and/or expense over the life of the underlying marketable security.
Although available to be sold to meet operating needs or otherwise, securities are generally held through maturity. The cost of securities sold is determined on a specific identification basis, and realized gains and losses are included in other income (expense) within the statement of operations and comprehensive loss. 
The Company reviews its portfolio of available-for-sale debt securities, using both quantitative and qualitative factors, to determine if declines in fair value below cost have resulted from a credit loss or other factors. If the decline in fair value is due to credit loss factors, a loss is recognized in net income. To date, the Company has not experienced any credit losses and does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk on these investments. 
​
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures for major renewals or betterments that extend the useful lives of property and equipment are capitalized; expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related asset. Property and equipment are depreciated as follows:

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets consist of property and equipment and right-of-use assets. Long-lived assets to be held and used are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the 
F-10

Table of Contents
assets may not be fully recoverable. Factors that the Company considers in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant underperformance of the business in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets. If an impairment review is performed to evaluate a long-lived asset group for recoverability, the Company compares forecasts of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the long-lived asset group to its carrying value. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset group are less than its carrying amount. The impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying value of the impaired asset group over its fair value, determined based on discounted cash flows. The Company did 
no
t record any impairment losses on long-lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2024 or 2023.
Leases
The Company accounts for leases using ASC Topic 842, Leases (“ASC 842”). At the inception of an arrangement, the Company determines whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the unique facts and circumstances present. Leases with a term greater than one year are recognized on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets, lease liabilities and, if applicable, long-term lease liabilities. Operating lease liabilities and their corresponding right-of-use assets are recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected remaining lease term. Certain adjustments to the right-of-use asset may be required for items such as incentives received. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable. As a result, the Company utilizes its estimated incremental borrowing rates, which are the rates incurred to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. 
In accordance with the guidance in ASC 842, components of a lease should be split into three categories: lease components (e.g., land, building, etc.), non-lease components (e.g., common area maintenance, consumables, etc.), and non-components (e.g., property taxes, insurance, etc.). Then the fixed and in-substance fixed contract consideration (including any related to non-components) must be allocated based on the respective relative fair values to the lease components and non-lease components. For operating leases, lease expense relating to fixed payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term and lease expense relating to variable payments is expensed as incurred.
Fair Value Measurements
ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement ("ASC 820"), establishes a fair value hierarchy for instruments measured at fair value that distinguishes between assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and the Company’s own assumptions (unobservable inputs). Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. ASC 820 identifies fair value as the exchange price, or exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, ASC 820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between the following:
Level 1
 — Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2
 — Inputs other than Level 1 inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable, such as quoted market prices, interest rates and yield curves.
Level 3
 — Unobservable inputs developed using estimates of assumptions developed by the Company, which reflect those that a market participant would use.
To the extent the valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair values requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized as Level 3. A financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

Table of Contents
Segment Information
Operating segments are defined as components of an entity about which separate discrete information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company views its operations and manages its business in 
one
 operating segment (Note 16).
Revenue Recognition
The Company accounts for revenue using the provisions of ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”). Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized for arrangements determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identification of the contract(s) with the customer, (ii) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract and determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations, (iii) measurement of the transaction price, (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations, and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Company assesses the goods or services promised within each contract and determines those that are performance obligations and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. The Company then recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.
The Company accounts for a contract with a customer that is within the scope of ASC 606 when all of the following criteria are met: (i) the arrangement has been approved by the parties and the parties are committed to perform their respective obligations, (ii) each party’s rights regarding the goods or services to be transferred can be identified, (iii) the payment terms for the goods or services to be transferred can be identified, (iv) the arrangement has commercial substance and (v) collection of substantially all of the consideration to which the Company will be entitled in exchange for the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer is probable.
The Company first evaluates license and/or collaboration arrangements to determine whether the arrangement (or part of the arrangement) represents a collaborative arrangement pursuant to ASC Topic 808, 
Collaborative Arrangements,
 based on the risks and rewards and activities of the parties pursuant to the contractual arrangement. The Company accounts for collaborative arrangements (or elements within the contract that are deemed part of a collaborative arrangement)
, which represent a collaborative relationship and not a customer relationship,
 outside of the scope of ASC 606. The Company’s two collaborations represented revenue arrangements.
For the arrangements or arrangement components that are subject to revenue accounting guidance, in determining the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfills its obligations under each of its agreements, the Company performs the following steps: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation. As part of the accounting for these arrangements, the Company must use significant judgment to determine: a) the number of performance obligations based on the determination under step (ii) above and whether those performance obligations are distinct from other performance obligations in the contract; b) the transaction price under step (iii) above; and c) the standalone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract for the allocation of transaction price in step (iv) above. The Company uses judgment to determine whether milestones or other variable consideration, except for royalties, should be included in the transaction price as described further below. The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, for which the Company recognizes revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied. In determining the stand-alone selling price of a license to the Company’s proprietary technology or a material right provided by a customer option, the Company considers market conditions as well as entity-specific factors, including those factors contemplated in negotiating the agreements as well as internally developed estimates that 
F-12

Table of Contents
include assumptions related to the market opportunity, estimated development costs, probability of success and the time needed to commercialize a product candidate pursuant to the license. In validating its estimated stand-alone selling prices, the Company evaluates whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine its estimated stand-alone selling prices will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration between performance obligations.
​
The Company estimates the transaction price based on the amount of consideration the Company expects to be received for transferring the promised goods or services in the contract. The consideration may include both fixed consideration and variable consideration. At the inception of each arrangement that includes variable consideration, the Company evaluates the amount of the potential payments and the likelihood that the payments will be received. The Company utilizes either the most likely amount method or expected value method to estimate the transaction price based on which method better predicts the amount of consideration expected to be received. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the variable consideration is included in the transaction price.
Performance obligations are promised goods or services in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. Promised goods or services are considered distinct when: (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or together with other readily available resources and (ii) the promised good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. In assessing whether promised goods or services are distinct, the Company considers factors such as the stage of development of the underlying intellectual property, the capabilities of the customer to develop the intellectual property on their own and whether the required expertise is readily available.
The Company allocates the transaction price based on the estimated standalone selling price. The Company must develop assumptions that require judgment to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract. The Company utilizes key assumptions to determine the standalone selling price, which may include other comparable transactions, pricing considered in negotiating the transaction and the estimated costs. Estimating costs for research and development programs is subjective as the Company estimates the costs anticipated to successfully complete the research performance obligations. As the research is novel, efforts to be successful may be significantly different than the estimated costs at the beginning of the contract. Certain variable consideration is allocated specifically to one or more performance obligations in a contract when the terms of the variable consideration relate to the satisfaction of the performance obligation and the resulting amounts allocated to each performance obligation are consistent with the amounts the Company would expect to receive for each performance obligation.
For performance obligations which consist of licenses and other promises, the Company utilizes judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation in order to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time. The Company determines the appropriate method of measuring progress of combined performance obligations satisfied over time for purposes of recognizing revenue. The Company evaluates the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. The estimated remaining costs is highly subjective, as the research is novel, therefore efforts to be successful may be significantly different than the estimated costs made at the balance sheet date. If the license to the Company’s intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, the Company will recognize revenue from non-refundable, up-front fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the license. The Company receives payments from customers based on billing schedules established in each contract. Up-front payments and fees are recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt or when due until the Company performs its obligations under these arrangements. Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as the current portion of deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amounts not expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as deferred revenue, net of current portion. Amounts are recorded as accounts receivable when the Company’s right to consideration is unconditional. Amounts recognized as revenue, but not yet received or invoiced, are generally recognized as contract assets.
Exclusive Licenses – 
If the license granted in the arrangement is determined to be distinct from the other promises or performance obligations identified in the arrangement, which generally include research and development services, the Company recognizes revenue from non-refundable, upfront fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to 
F-13

Table of Contents
the customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the license. In assessing whether a license is distinct from the other promises, the Company considers relevant facts and circumstances of each arrangement, including the research and development capabilities of the collaboration partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. In addition, the Company considers whether the collaboration partner can benefit from the license for its intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining promise, whether the value of the license is dependent on the unsatisfied promise, whether there are other vendors that could provide the remaining promise, and whether it is separately identifiable from the remaining promise. For licenses that are combined with other promises, the Company utilizes judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue. The Company evaluates the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. The measure of progress, and thereby periods over which revenue should be recognized, are subject to estimates by management and may change over the course of the arrangement.

Research and Development Services – 
The promises under the Company’s collaboration and license agreements generally include research and development services to be performed by the Company on behalf of the collaboration partner. For performance obligations that include research and development services, the Company generally recognizes revenue allocated to such performance obligations based on an appropriate measure of progress. The Company utilizes judgment to determine the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue, which is generally an input measure, such as costs incurred. The Company evaluates the measure of progress each reporting period as described under 
Exclusive Licenses 
above. Reimbursements from the partner that are the result of a collaborative relationship with the partner, instead of a customer relationship, such as co-development activities, are generally recorded as a reduction to research and development expense.
Customer Options – 
The Company’s arrangements may provide a collaborator with the right to certain optional purchases, such as the right to license a target either at the inception of the arrangement or within a pre-defined option period. Under these agreements, fees may be due to the Company (i) at the inception of the arrangement as an upfront fee or payment or (ii) upon the exercise of an option to acquire a license. If an arrangement is determined to contain customer options that allow the customer to acquire additional goods or services, the goods and services underlying the customer options are not considered to be performance obligations at the outset of the arrangement, as they are contingent upon option exercise. The Company evaluates the customer options for material rights, or options to acquire additional goods or services for free or at a discount. If the customer options are determined to represent a material right, the material right is recognized as a separate performance obligation at the inception of the arrangement. The Company allocates the transaction price to material rights based on the relative stand-alone selling price, which is determined based on the identified discount, and the probability that the customer will exercise the option. Amounts allocated to a material right are not recognized as revenue until, at the earliest, the option is exercised or expires.
Milestone Payments – 
At the inception of each arrangement that includes milestone payments based on certain events, the Company evaluates whether the milestones are considered probable of being achieved and estimates the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within the control of the Company or the licensee, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. The Company evaluates factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial, and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the particular milestone in making this assessment. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, the Company reevaluates the probability of achievement of all milestones subject to constraint and, if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment. If a milestone or other variable consideration relates specifically to the Company’s efforts to satisfy a single performance obligation or to a specific outcome from satisfying the performance obligation, the Company generally allocates the milestone amount entirely to that performance obligation once it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur.

Royalties – 
For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on a level of sales, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, the Company recognizes revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). To date, the Company has not recognized any royalty revenue resulting from any of its licensing arrangements.

Research and Development Expenses and Related Accruals/Prepaids
Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred and consist of costs incurred in performing research and development activities, including compensation related expenses for research and development personnel, preclinical and clinical activities including cost of clinical drug supply, overhead expenses including facilities expenses, materials and supplies, amounts paid to consultants and outside service providers, and depreciation of equipment. Upfront license payments related to acquired technologies which have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use are also included in research and development expense.
The Company has entered into various research and development service arrangements under which vendors perform various services. The Company records accrued expenses for estimated costs incurred under the arrangements in excess of vendor invoices received while cash payments to vendors, including those that are nonrefundable, in excess of estimated costs incurred are recorded as prepaid expenses. Prepaid expenses are expensed as the related services are performed or goods are received. When evaluating the adequacy and accuracy of the accrued and prepaid expenses, the Company reviews open contracts and purchase orders, the level of service performed, invoices received, contracted costs, and progress of studies, clinical trials or other activities based on communication with internal and/or external personnel. Significant judgments and estimates are made in determining the accrued and prepaid expense balances at the end of each reporting period, and payments for these activities are due based on the terms of individual arrangements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred.
Equity-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for equity awards, including restricted stock units, and common stock options, granted as equity award compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation — Stock Compensation ("ASC 718"). ASC 718 requires all stock-based payments to employees, which includes grants of employee equity awards, to be recognized as expense in the statements of operations based on their grant date fair values. 
The fair value of each restricted stock unit is based on the fair value of the Company’s common stock less any purchase price, if applicable. The fair value of each stock option award is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which uses as inputs the fair value of the Company’s common stock and certain subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, the expected term of the award, the risk-free rate, and expected dividends. Through the second quarter of 2024, expected volatility was calculated based on a blend of the Company’s reported volatility data for the length of time that market data was available for the Company’s stock and the historical data for a representative group of publicly traded companies, for which historical information was available. As of the third quarter of 2024, the Company’s own volatility data covered a period of time that was sufficient to meet the expected term of the granted awards and the blended approach was no longer needed. The historical volatility is generally calculated based on a period of time commensurate with the expected term assumptions. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant commensurate with the expected term assumption. The Company uses the simplified method, under which the expected term is presumed to be the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term. The Company utilizes this method due to lack of historical exercise data and the plain nature of its stock-based awards. The expected dividend yield is assumed to be 
zero
 as the Company has never paid dividends and has no current plans to pay any dividends on common stock.
Compensation expense related to equity awards to employees that are subject to graded vesting is recognized on a straight-line basis, based on the grant date fair value, over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term. For awards subject to performance conditions, the Company recognizes equity award compensation expense using an accelerated recognition method over the remaining service period when management determines that 
F-15

Table of Contents
achievement of the milestone is probable. Management evaluates when the achievement of a performance-based milestone is probable based on the relative satisfaction of the performance conditions as of the reporting date.
The Company classifies equity-based compensation expense in its consolidated statements of operations in the same manner in which the award recipient’s salary and related costs are classified or in which the award recipient’s service payments are classified.
The Company accounts for forfeitures when they occur.
Comprehensive Loss
Comprehensive loss is the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. Comprehensive loss includes net loss and the change in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the period. Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) consisted entirely of unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale marketable securities during the period ending December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Net Loss per Share
The Company applies the two-class method to compute basic and diluted net loss per share because it has issued shares that meet the definition of participating securities. The two-class method determines net income (loss) per share for each class of common and participating securities according to dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The two-class method requires income (losses) available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between common and participating securities based upon their respective rights to share in the earnings as if all income (losses) for the period had been distributed. During periods of loss, there is no allocation required under the two-class method since the participating securities do not have a contractual obligation to fund the losses of the Company.
The Company calculates basic net loss per share by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, including pre-funded warrants and excluding restricted common stock. The Company calculates diluted net loss per share by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, as applicable, after giving consideration to the dilutive effect of restricted stock units, warrants, pre-funded warrants, and stock options that are outstanding during the period. 
Income Taxes
Income taxes are recorded in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ("ASC 740"), which provides for deferred taxes using an asset and liability approach. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on future income tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities, and their respective income tax basis. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. 
The Company provides reserves for potential payments of tax to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions, as necessary. The tax benefits recorded are based on a determination of whether and how much of a tax benefit taken by the Company in its tax filings or positions is "more likely than not" to be realized following resolution of any uncertainty related to the tax benefit, assuming that the matter in question will be raised by the tax authorities.
The Company is open to examination by the Internal Revenue Service for the tax years ended December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2024. Since the Company is in a U.S. loss carryforward position, carryforward tax attributes generated in prior years may still be adjusted upon future examination if they have or will be used in a future period. The Company is currently not under examination by the Internal Revenue Service or any other jurisdictions for any tax years. The Company has not recorded any interest or penalties on any unrecognized tax benefits since its inception.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
. The standard requires disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis and allows for multiple measures of a segment’s profit or loss provided that one of those measures is consistent with GAAP. The amendments in this update do not change how a public company identifies its operating segments, aggregates those operating segments, or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments, but rather requires public entities to disclose significant segment expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim basis and provide in interim periods all disclosures about a reporting segment’s profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. ASU 2023-07 becomes effective for the annual period starting on January 1, 2024, and for interim periods starting on January 1, 2025 (see Note 16)
.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures,
 which enhances the transparency of income tax disclosures to provide information to investors to better assess how a company’s operations and related tax risks, tax planning and operational opportunities affect its tax rate and prospects for future cash flows. This requires public entities to disclose additional categories in the rate reconciliation regarding federal and state income taxes and provide more details surrounding reconciling items if a quantitative threshold is met. The effective date for public companies is for annual periods starting on January 1, 2025. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance, however, 
the Company has decided not to early adopt, does not anticipate a material impact to its net financial position, and is still evaluating the impact on its disclosures in future years as a result of the adoption of ASU 2023-09.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, 
Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40)
: 
Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
, and in January 2025, the FASB issued ASU No. 2025-01, 
Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Clarifying the Effective Date
. ASU 2024-03 requires additional disclosure of the nature of expenses included in the income statement as well as disclosures about specific types of expenses included in the expense captions presented in the income statement. ASU 2024-03, as clarified by ASU 2025-01, is effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027.

Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are Level 1 assets and include investments in money market funds, U.S. treasury obligations and government agency securities that are valued using quoted market prices. Accordingly, money market funds and government funds are categorized as Level 1 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. There were 
no
 transfers of assets between fair value measurement levels during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
The carrying amounts reflected in the balance sheets for prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate their fair values at December 31, 2024 and 2023, due to their short-term nature. 
The Company believes the terms of its debt reflect current market conditions for an instrument with similar terms and maturity, therefore the carrying value of the Company's debt approximates its fair value based on Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

Amortized cost approximated fair value for money market funds and U.S. treasury obligations included in cash and cash equivalents. The aggregate fair value of marketable securities with unrealized losses was $
23.9
 million and $
11.9
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

At December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
12
 investments and 
three
 investments, respectively, were in an unrealized loss position. All such investments have been in an unrealized loss position for less than a year and these losses are considered temporary. The Company has the ability and intent to hold these investments until a recovery of their amortized cost, which may not occur until maturity. 
The Company believes that U.S. treasury obligations and government agency securities are subject to minimal credit risk. As a result, the Company did not record any charges for credit-related impairments for its available-for-sale securities for the year ended December 31, 2024.

8. Preferred Stock
The Board of Directors or any authorized committee thereof is expressly authorized, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to provide by resolution or resolutions for, out of the unissued shares of Preferred Stock, the issuance of the shares of Preferred Stock in one or more series of such stock, and by filing a certificate of designations pursuant to applicable law of the State of Delaware, to establish or change from time to time the number of shares of each such series, and to fix the designations, powers, including voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, preferences and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of the shares of each series and any qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof.
9. Common Stock
In June 2024, the stockholders approved an amendment to the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 
150,000,000
 to 
300,000,000
. 
In October 2024, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Jefferies LLC and Piper Sandler & Co., as representatives of the several underwriters named therein

(the “Underwriters”), relating to the issuance and sale of an aggregate of 
10,265,488
 shares of the Company’s common stock at 
$
28.25
 per share and pre-funded warrants to purchase 
353,983
 shares of its common stock. The offering price per pre-funded warrant was 
$
28.2499
, which equals the per share public offering price for the common shares less the 
$
0.0001
 exercise price for each such pre-funded warrant. The pre-funded warrants are exercisable at any time and only expire when exercised in full. The offering closed on October 10, 2024. Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, the Underwriters were granted a 30-day option to purchase up to 
1,592,920
 additional shares (the “Option 
F-20

Table of Contents
Shares”) of common stock, which was exercised in full on October 16, 2024. Total proceeds of the transaction, including the Option Shares were approximately 
$
324.4
 million, net of underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses.
The Company has had a sales agreement in place during various time periods with Jefferies LLC (“Jefferies”) with respect to an at-the-market (“ATM”) offering program. Under this program, the Company is able to offer and sell, from time to time at its sole discretion, shares of its common stock through Jefferies as its sales agent. In an ATM offering, exchange-listed companies incrementally sell newly issued shares into the secondary trading market through a designated broker-dealer at prevailing market prices. The current ATM agreement, established in November 2022, allows for the sale of shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 
$
100
 million. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has sold 
619,290
 shares, generating net proceeds of 
$
5.2
 million, under the ATM program. 
No
 sales were made under the ATM program during the year ended December 31, 2024. 
​
The Company has issued pre-funded warrants to purchase common stock, as well as warrants to purchase common stock as part of its financing activities. Both the pre-funded warrants and warrants meet the conditions for equity classification and are recorded as a component of stockholders’ equity

within additional paid-in capital. In October 2024, June 2022 and November 2020, the Company issued 
353,983
, 
25,510,205
 and 
2,179,487
 pre-funded warrants, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
2,526,833
 and 
8,154,695
, respectively 
of the Company’s pre-funded warrants were exercised. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has 
17,362,147
 pre-funded warrants outstanding. In June 2022, the Company also issued 
10,459,181
 warrants with an exercise price of 
$
7.35
. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
1,309,492

10. Equity-Based Compensation
Equity Plans
As of December 31, 2024, the Company has four active equity plans, the 2018 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the “2018 Plan”), the 2017 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the “2017 Plan”), the 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “2018 ESPP”) and the 2022 Inducement Equity Plan (the “2022 Inducement Plan”).
2018 Stock Option and Incentive Plan
The 2018 Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors on May 2, 2018, and approved by the Company’s stockholders on May 11, 2018. The 2018 Plan has replaced the 2017 Plan as 
no
 additional awards will be granted under that plan following the consummation of the Initial Public Offering (“IPO”). 
F-21

Table of Contents
The 2018 Plan provides for the grant of equity-based incentive awards, including incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, restricted stock awards, unrestricted stock awards and restricted stock units to the Company’s officers, employees, directors and other key persons (including consultants). Stock options and restricted stock units granted under the 2018 Plan to employees generally vest over 
four years
. The shares of common stock underlying any awards that are forfeited, cancelled, repurchased or are otherwise terminated by the Company under the 2018 Plan will be added back to the shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2018 Plan. 
The 2018 Plan provides that the number of shares reserved and available for issuance under the plan will automatically increase each January 1, beginning on January 1, 2019, by 
4
% of the outstanding number of shares of common stock on the immediately preceding December 31 or such lesser number of shares as determined by the Board of Directors or compensation committee (the “Annual Increase”). These limits are subject to adjustment in the event of a stock split, stock dividend or other change in the Company’s capitalization.
2017 Stock Option and Incentive Plan
The 2017 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, restricted stock awards, unrestricted stock awards and restricted stock units. Stock options granted under the 2017 Plan to employees generally vest over 
four years
. The Company no longer issues grants from the 2017 Plan. The shares of common stock underlying any awards that are forfeited, cancelled, repurchased or are otherwise terminated by the Company under the 2017 Plan will be added back to the shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2018 Plan. 
2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
On May 2, 2018, the Board of Directors adopted the 2018 ESPP, and it was approved by the stockholders on May 11, 2018. At December 31, 2024 there were 
2,196,691
 shares available to grant under the 2018 ESPP and 
no
 shares had been issued. The ESPP provides that the number of shares reserved and available for issuance will automatically increase each January 1, beginning on January 1, 2019 through January 1, 2028, by the lesser of (i) 
353,614

Total Net Deferred Tax Assets
Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance has been established against the net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets increased by $
76.5
 million and $
49.2
 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. This increase mainly relates to the establishment of a valuation allowance against the Company’s net domestic deferred tax assets in connection with net operating losses generated in each year, capitalized research expenses and additional tax credit carryforwards generated. Starting with tax years beginning after December 31, 2021, entities are required to capitalize all research and experimentation “R&D” expenses as defined under Section 174 of the Internal Revenue Code and amortize them over five years for domestic expenses and over fifteen years for foreign expenses. During the year, the Company capitalized $
121.5
 million of R&D expenses, net of current and prior year amortization deductions. The corresponding deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2024 is $
80.4
 million. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately $
512.6
 million and $
498.8
 million of Federal and State operating loss carryforwards respectively, which begin to expire in 2032, except for $
462.1
 million of the Company’s federal net operating loss carryforwards, and $
0.2
 million of state net operating losses that do not expire. These loss carryforwards may be available to reduce future taxable income, if any. These loss carryforwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by the appropriate taxing authorities. As of December 31, 2024, the Company also had federal and state credit carryovers of $
54.9
 million and $
7.7
 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2034 and 2025, respectively. The amount of loss and credit carryforwards that may be utilized in any future period may be limited based upon changes in the ownership of the Company’s ultimate parent. Additionally, the deductibility of federal net operating losses generated after December 31, 2017 and the indefinite state net operating losses is limited to 80% of the Company’s taxable income in any future taxable year.
The Company follows the provisions of ASC 740-10, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” which specifies how tax benefits for uncertain tax positions are to be recognized, measured, and recorded in financial statements; requires certain disclosures of uncertain tax matters; specifies how reserves for uncertain tax positions should be classified on the balance sheet; and provides transition and interim period guidance, among other provisions. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company has 
no
t recorded any amounts for uncertain tax positions. The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties accrued on any uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense, if any, in its statements of income.
F-25

Table of Contents
The Company’s net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may become subject to an annual limitation in the event of certain cumulative changes in the ownership interest of significant shareholders over a three-year period in excess of 50 percent as defined under Section 382 and 383 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively, as well as similar state provisions. The amount of the annual limitation is determined based on the value of the Company immediately prior to the ownership change. The Company conducted a Section 382 study covering the period of November 26, 2013 through December 31, 2023. The study concluded that ownership changes occurred during that period which limit the amount of the Company’s net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards that can be utilized before expiring. The carryforwards disclosed represent the amount of attributes that can be utilized based on the results of the study.
​
All of the Company’s tax years will remain open for examination by the federal and state tax authorities to the extent that the Company's tax attributes are utilized in future years to offset income or income taxes.
12. Commitments and Contingencies
Operating Lease
In November 2019, the Company entered into a lease of office and laboratory space at 301 Binney Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts to be used as its new corporate headquarters (“the Lease”). The expiration date of the Lease was originally in August 2025 and included an 
option to extend
 the term by 
two years
. The base rent under the original Lease was $
6.9
 million per year, subject to an annual increase of 
3.5
%. Variable lease payments include the Company’s allocated share of costs incurred and expenditures made by the landlord in the operation and management of the building. The Lease included incentives of $
14.1
 million in the form of an allowance for tenant improvements related to the design and build out of the space. In connection with the Lease, the Company has secured a letter of credit for $
2.3
 million which renews automatically each year. 
​
In May 2024, the Company entered into the First Amendment (the “Lease Amendment”) to the Lease to extend the term for approximately 
two years
, commencing on August 19, 2025 (the “First Extension Term”) with the base rent to start at approximately $
6.2
 million per year, followed by a 
3
% annual increase. Pursuant to the Lease Amendment, the Company also has an 
option to extend
 the term of the Lease by 
five years
, upon the expiration of the First Extension Term.

13. Debt 
On October 16, 2020 (the “Closing Date”) the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Oxford Finance LLC (“Oxford”) and Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”) for $
50.0
 million (the “Loan and Security Agreement”). Tranche 1 of $
25.0
 million was funded on the Closing Date. The Company had an additional

$
25.0
 million in loan proceeds available under Tranche 2 which was funded in December 2021, in conjunction with the Company entering into the First Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement with Oxford and SVB. The Loan and Security Agreement was to mature on May 1, 2025 and required interest-only payments through November 2022, with principal payments to commence in December 2022.
 Pursuant to the Loan and Security Agreement,
 the Company was required to maintain cash in an SVB account equal to the lesser of 
100
%
 of the Company’s consolidated cash or 
105
%
 of the dollar amount of the outstanding debt.
​
On November 10, 2022, the Company entered into the Second Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement (“Amendment 2”) to increase the Company’s borrowing capacity under the Loan and Security Agreement to an amount up to $
100.0
 million, comprised of the original $
50.0
 million loan which remains outstanding and two additional $
25.0
 million tranches. The first $
25.0
 million tranche available under Amendment 2, was available at the Company’s discretion through December 2023 upon achievement of certain development and business performance milestones. The Company did not exercise this tranche. The second $
25.0
 million tranche available under Amendment 2, may be available upon the Company’s request, at Oxford and SVB’s discretion. Amendment 2 also extended the interest-only payment period for an additional 24 months through November 2024, with principal payments to commence in December 2024. The maturity of the loan was extended to November 2027. 
​
Effective upon Amendment 2, the interest rate on the unpaid principal is the greater of the Wall Street Journal 
prime rate
 plus 
4.60
% or 
9.35
% per annum. Prepayment is permitted and may include a pre-payment fee ranging from 
0
% - 
3
% (of the principal amount being prepaid), depending on when the prepayment is made. The Company is also required to make a final payment equal to 
2
% of the original principal amount. 
​
In conjunction with Amendment 2, the Company was required to pay $
0.9
 million for the accrued portion of the final payment on the previous outstanding balance.
​
On March 10, 2023, SVB was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) as receiver. Afterward, the FDIC transferred all deposits of the former Silicon Valley Bank to Silicon Valley Bridge Bank, N.A., as operated by the FDIC. On March 27, 2023, 
F-27

Table of Contents
Silicon Valley Bridge Bank was closed by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the FDIC was appointed as receiver. First Citizens Bank then entered into an agreement with the FDIC to purchase out of FDIC receivership substantially all loans and certain other assets and assume all customer deposits and certain other liabilities of Silicon Valley Bridge Bank. On March 27, 2023, Silicon Valley Bridge Bank and its U.S. branches began operating as Silicon Valley Bank, a division of First Citizens Bank.
​
On April 18, 2023, the Company entered into Amendment 3 to the Loan and Security Agreement to amend certain provisions relating to the Company’s operating accounts.
​
On May 17, 2024, the Company entered into the Fourth Amendment to the Loan and Security Agreement (“Amendment 4”). The Company currently has $
50.0
 million outstanding under the Loan and Security Agreement, which was drawn down in two equal tranches. The third $
25.0
 million tranche is available at the Company’s discretion through December 2024, upon achievement of certain clinical and business milestones, which were amended under Amendment 4. The fourth $
25.0
 million tranche may be available through June 1, 2025 (or through December 1, 2025, upon achievement of certain business milestones) upon the Company’s request, at Oxford and SVB’s discretion. Amendment 4 also extends the interest-only payment period for an additional six months through May 2025, with principal payments to commence in June 2025. Additionally, upon achievement of certain business performance milestones, which were achieved in October 2024, the interest-only payment period was extended through November 2025, with principal payments to commence in December 2025.
​
On February 10, 2025, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the “Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement”) with Oxford. The Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement amends and restates in its entirety that certain Loan and Security Agreement, as amended.

The Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement provides for term loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $
200.0
 million (each, a “Term Loan” and together, the “Term Loans”) subject to funding in four tranches. To date, the Company has received $
50.0
 million of Term Loans. The remaining three tranches, each in an amount of $
50.0
 million, are available to be borrowed (a) in the case of the second tranche, until December 31, 2025, (b) in the case of the third tranche, after the achievement of certain development and business performance milestones until September 30, 2026, and (c) in the case of the fourth tranche, after the achievement of certain development and business performance milestones until December 31, 2027. The Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement consolidates the existing outstanding loan tranches solely with Oxford and also extends the interest-only payment period through March 2029, with principal payments to commence in April 2029.

The outstanding principal of each Term Loan has an annual interest rate of (a) the greater of (i) the 
1-Month CME Term SOFR
 on the last business day of the month that immediately precedes the month in which the interest will accrue and (ii) 
3
% , plus (b) 
5.5
%. Interest is payable on a monthly basis based on the principal amount outstanding during the preceding month. In addition, the Company is required to pay Oxford a final payment fee equal to 
2.00
% of the original principal amount of each Term Loan advanced to the Company.

Adjusted for the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement entered into in February 2025, the following table shows required payments (excluding interest), during the next five years on debt outstanding at December 31, 2024 (in thousands):

14. Net Loss per Share
The Company calculates basic net loss per share by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, excluding restricted common stock. The weighted average number of common shares used in the basic and diluted net loss per share calculation includes the pre-funded warrants issued in connection with the Company’s November 2020, June 2022 and October 2024 follow-on offerings as the pre-funded warrants are exercisable at any time for nominal cash consideration. As of December 31, 2024, 
10,681,528
 pre-funded warrants have been exercised and 
17,362,147
 pre-funded warrants are outstanding. The Company has generated a net loss in all periods presented, so the basic and diluted net loss per share are the same, as the inclusion of the potentially dilutive securities would be anti-dilutive.
​
Basic and diluted net loss per share is calculated as follows (in thousands, except share and per share data):

15. Retirement Plan
The Company sponsors a 401(k) retirement plan, in which substantially all employees are eligible to participate upon employment. Participants may contribute a percentage of their annual compensation to this plan, subject to statutory limitations. Effective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted a policy to match 
50
% of the employee contributions to the 401(k) plan up to a maximum of 
6
% of the participating employee’s eligible earnings, resulting in a maximum company match of 
3
% of the participating employee’s eligible earnings subject to statutory limitations. The Company recognized $
1.1
 million and $
0.9
 million in expense related to the match during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
16. Segment Reporting
The Company operates and manages its business as a 
single
 segment for the purposes of assessing performance and making operating decisions. The Company’s president and chief executive officer, who is the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), reviews the Company’s financial information on a consolidated basis for purposes of evaluating financial performance and allocating resources and; therefore we have presented segment information on the same basis.  When evaluating the Company’s financial performance, the CODM regularly reviews net loss, non-operating expenses and operating expenses with non-cash expenses such as depreciation and equity-based compensation expense removed. The CODM considers net loss in making decisions on how to allocate resources. The measure of segment assets is
