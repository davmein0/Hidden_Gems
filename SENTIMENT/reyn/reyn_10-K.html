Each employee, director, officer, consultant and other agent of the Company, including their immediate family members, persons with whom they share a household, their economic dependents and any other individuals or entities whose securities trading they influence, direct or control, is expected to abide by this policy. When carrying out Company business, employees, directors, officers, consultants and other agents must avoid any activity that violates applicable laws or regulations. In order to avoid even an appearance of impropriety, the Company&#8217;s directors, officers and certain other employees are subject to pre-approval requirements and other limitations on their ability to enter into transactions involving the Company&#8217;s securities. Although these limitations do not apply to transactions pursuant to written plans for trading securities that comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), the entry into, amendment or termination of any such written trading plan is subject to pre-approval requirements and other limitations. </font></div><div style="margin-bottom:12.5pt;padding-right:21.6pt;text-align:justify"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:11pt;font-weight:700;line-height:140%">II.

U.S. securities laws give the Company, its officers and directors, and other employees the responsibility to ensure that information about the Company is not used unlawfully in the purchase and sale of securities. </font></div><div style="margin-bottom:12.5pt;padding-right:21.6pt;text-align:justify"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:11pt;font-weight:400;line-height:140%">All employees, directors, officers, consultants and other agents of the Company should pay particularly close attention to the laws against trading on &#8220;inside&#8221; information. These laws are based upon the belief that all persons trading in a company&#8217;s securities should have equal access to all &#8220;material&#8221; information about that company. For example, if an employee or a director of a company knows material non-public financial information, that employee or director is prohibited from buying or selling shares in the company until the information has been disclosed to the public. This is because the employee or director knows information that will probably cause the share price to change, and it would be unfair for the employee or director to have an advantage (knowledge that the share price will change) that the rest of the investing public does not have. In fact, it is more than unfair&#59; it is fraudulent and illegal. Civil and criminal penalties for this kind of activity are severe. </font></div><div style="margin-bottom:12.5pt;padding-right:21.6pt;text-align:justify"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:11pt;font-weight:400;line-height:140%">The general rule can be stated as follows&#58; It is a violation of federal securities laws for any person to buy or sell securities if he or she has material non-public information. Information is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important in making an investment decision or would view the information as significantly altering the total mix of information in the marketplace. It is non-public information if it has not been publicly disclosed in a manner making it available to investors generally on a broad-based non-exclusionary basis. Furthermore, it is illegal for any person having material non-public information to provide other people with such information or to </font></div><div style="height:58.32pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="margin-bottom:8pt;text-align:center"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:11pt;font-weight:400;line-height:125%">2</font></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div style="min-height:97.2pt;width:100%"><div style="margin-bottom:8pt"><font><br></font></div></div><div style="margin-bottom:12.5pt;padding-right:21.6pt;text-align:justify"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:11pt;font-weight:400;line-height:140%">recommend that they buy or sell the securities.

A breach of the insider trading laws could expose the insider to substantial criminal fines and terms of imprisonment, in addition to civil penalties and injunctive actions. In addition, punitive damages may be imposed under applicable state laws. Securities laws also subject controlling persons to civil penalties for illegal insider trading by employees, including employees located outside the United States. Controlling persons include directors, officers, and supervisors. </font></div><div style="margin-bottom:12.5pt;padding-right:21.6pt;text-align:justify"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:11pt;font-weight:400;line-height:140%">Inside information does not belong to the individual directors, officers, employees, consultants and other agents who may handle it or otherwise become knowledgeable about it. It is an asset of the Company. For any person to use such information for personal benefit or to disclose it to others outside the Company violates the Company&#8217;s interests and is a fraud against members of the investing public and the Company. </font></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.15pt;padding-left:18pt;padding-right:21.6pt;text-align:justify"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:11pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:140%">B.

Each employee, director, officer, consultant and other agent of the Company is responsible for ensuring that these other individuals and entities comply with this policy. Because of their potential ability to access to confidential information on a regular basis, Company policy subjects its directors and certain employees to additional restrictions on trading in Company securities, which are discussed below. In addition, the General Counsel may impose ad hoc restrictions on trading on individual Covered Persons with inside knowledge of material information from time to time. Please note that portions of this policy continue to apply to Covered Persons even after their departure from the Company, and even after they no longer have any material nonpublic information.</font></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.15pt;padding-left:18pt;padding-right:21.6pt;text-align:justify"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:11pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:140%">C.

People who buy options are betting that the stock price will move rapidly. For that reason, when a person trades in options in his or her employer&#8217;s stock, it will arouse suspicion in the eyes of the SEC that the person was trading on the basis of inside information, particularly where the trading occurs before a company announcement or major event. It is difficult for an employee or director to prove that he or she did not know about the announcement or event. </font></div><div style="padding-right:21.6pt;text-align:justify"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:11pt;font-weight:400;line-height:140%">If the SEC or the stock exchanges were to notice active options trading by one or more employees or directors of the Company prior to an announcement, they would investigate. Such an investigation could be embarrassing to the Company (as well as expensive), and could result in severe penalties and expense for the persons involved. For all of these reasons, the Company prohibits its employees, directors, officers, consultants and other agents of the Company and all Covered Persons from trading in options or other securities involving the Company&#8217;s stock.</font></div><div style="padding-right:21.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:18pt"><font><br></font></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.05pt;padding-right:21.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:18pt"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:11pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:140%">E.

For example, securities held in a margin account may be sold by a broker without the customer&#8217;s consent if the customer fails to meet a margin call. Because such a sale may occur at a time when an employee or a director has material inside information or is otherwise not permitted to trade in Company securities, the Company prohibits Covered Persons from pledging Company securities in any circumstance, including by purchasing Company securities on margin or holding Company securities in a margin account. </font></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.05pt;padding-right:21.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:18pt"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:11pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:140%">F.

Investing in the Company&#8217;s common stock provides an opportunity to share in the future growth of the Company. But investment in the Company and sharing in the growth of the Company does not mean short range speculation based on fluctuations in the market. Such activities put the personal gain of the person trading in conflict with the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. Although this policy does not prohibit Covered Persons from selling shares, the Company encourages them to avoid frequent trading in Company stock.

Any person who wishes to report possible or suspected violations of this policy should report them to the attention of the General Counsel. If the reporting person&#8217;s situation requires that his or her identity be kept secret, it will be preserved to the greatest extent reasonably possible and permitted by law.

The SEC has enacted rules that provide an affirmative defense against alleged violations of U.S. federal insider trading laws for trades under trading plans that meet certain requirements. These requirements are spelled out in Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, and trading plans that comply with those requirements are therefore known as &#8220;10b5-1 plans.&#8221; In general, Rule 10b5-1 provides an affirmative defense from insider trading liability under the federal securities laws for trading plans that meet certain requirements. In general, a 10b5-1 plan must be entered into (or modified) in good faith, not as part of a plan or scheme to evade the prohibitions of the insider trading rules and during a time when the trading person is not aware of material non-public information. The plan must either specify (including by formula) the amount, pricing and timing of the transactions in advance or delegate discretion on those matters to an independent party. The plan must also provide for a cooling-off period for at least the minimum period required under, and must comply with all other applicable provisions of, Rule 10b5-1(c) of the Exchange Act.</font></div><div style="padding-right:21.6pt;text-align:justify"><font><br></font></div><div style="padding-right:21.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:11pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The restrictions in this policy against trades made while aware of material non-public information, or by members of the Window Group during a time when the Window is closed (and the requirement that members of the Window Group obtain preclearance for trades) do not apply to trades made under 10b5-1 plans pre-approved by the General Counsel. All 10b5-1 plans, and all amendments thereto, including suspensions and terminations thereof, must be approved by the General Counsel.

Wholly apart from Section 16(c), the Company prohibits directors and employees from selling the Company&#8217;s stock short.

Certain exempt transactions may be reported on Form 5 within 45 days after the end of the fiscal year. The fact that an insider&#8217;s transactions during the month resulted in no net change, or the fact that no securities were owned after the transactions were completed, does not provide a basis for failing to report. </font></div><div style="margin-bottom:12.5pt;padding-right:21.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:11pt;font-weight:400;line-height:140%">All changes in the amount or the form (</font><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:11pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:140%">i.e., </font><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:11pt;font-weight:400;line-height:140%">direct or indirect) of beneficial ownership (not just purchases and sales) must be reported.

An insider is considered the direct owner of all Company equity securities held in his or her own name or held jointly with others. An insider is considered the indirect owner of any securities from which he obtains benefits substantially equivalent to those of ownership. Thus, equity securities of the Company beneficially owned through partnerships, corporations, trusts, estates and by family members generally are subject to reporting. Absent countervailing facts, an insider is presumed to be the beneficial owner of securities held by his or her spouse and other family members sharing the same household. But an insider is free to disclaim beneficial ownership of these or any other securities being reported if the insider believes there is a reasonable basis for doing so. </font></div><div style="height:58.32pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="margin-bottom:8pt;text-align:center"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:11pt;font-weight:400;line-height:125%">10</font></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div style="min-height:97.2pt;width:100%"><div style="margin-bottom:8pt"><font><br></font></div></div><div style="margin-bottom:12.5pt;padding-right:21.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:11pt;font-weight:400;line-height:140%">It is important that reports under Section 16(a) be prepared properly and filed on a timely basis. The reports must be received at the SEC by the filing deadline. There is no provision for an extension of the filing deadlines, and the SEC can take enforcement action against insiders who do not comply fully with the filing requirements. In addition, the Company is required to disclose in its annual proxy statement the names of insiders who failed to file Section 16(a) reports properly during the fiscal year, along with the particulars of such instances of noncompliance. </font></div><div style="margin-bottom:12.5pt;padding-right:21.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:11pt;font-weight:400;line-height:140%">Accordingly, all directors and officers must notify the Company&#8217;s General Counsel, prior to any transactions or changes in their or their family members&#8217; beneficial ownership involving Company stock and are strongly encouraged to avail themselves of the assistance available from the General Counsel&#8217;s office in satisfying the reporting requirements. </font></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;padding-right:21.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:11pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">(2) </font><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:11pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline">Schedule 13D and 13G</font><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:11pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">.

The threshold for reporting is met if the stock owned, when coupled with the amount of stock subject to derivatives (such as warrants or options) exercisable within 60 days, exceeds the five percent limit. </font></div><div style="margin-bottom:12.5pt;padding-right:21.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:11pt;font-weight:400;line-height:140%">A report on Schedule 13D is required to be filed with the SEC and submitted to the Company within ten days after the reporting threshold is reached.
