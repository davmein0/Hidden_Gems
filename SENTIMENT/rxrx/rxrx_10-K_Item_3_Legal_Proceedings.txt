Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following is a discussion and analysis of the financial condition of 
Recursion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Recursion, the Company, we, us or our)
 and the results of our operations. This commentary should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes appearing in Item 8, “Financial Statements.” This discussion, particularly information with respect to our future results of operations or financial condition, business strategy and plans and objectives of management for future operations, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties as described under the heading "Note About Forward-Looking Statements" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. You should review the disclosure under the heading "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. 
Overview 
Recursion is a leading clinical stage TechBio company with a mission to decode biology to radically improve lives. We aim to achieve our mission by industrializing drug discovery using the Recursion Operating System (OS), a vertical platform of diverse technologies that enables us to map and navigate trillions of biological, chemical, and patient-centric relationships utilizing approximately 65 petabytes of proprietary data. The Recursion OS integrates ‘Real World’ data generated in our own wet-laboratories or by select partners and a ‘World Model’ which is a collection of AI computational models we also build in-house. Today, our scaled ‘wet-lab’ biology, chemistry, and patient-centric experimental data feed our ‘dry-lab’ computational tools to identify, validate, and translate therapeutic insights, which we can then validate in our wet-lab to both advance drug discovery programs and to generate data to further refine our world model. 
There are a few key factors that differentiate Recursion from other technology-enabled drug discovery companies. 
1.
Recursion has built a full-stack platform utilizing many biology, chemistry, and patient-centric proprietary datasets and modular tools to industrialize drug discovery, while most other competitor companies rely on a point solution to solve one important step in drug discovery. We recognize that drug discovery is made up of many steps, and a point solution is insufficient to generate efficiencies across the entire process. To decode biology, we must construct a full-stack technology platform capable of integrating and industrializing many complex workflows.
2.
Recursion integrates wet-lab and dry-lab capabilities in-house to create a virtuous cycle of iteration. Fit-for-purpose wet-lab experimental data are translated by dry-lab digital tools into in silico hypotheses and testable predictions, which in turn generates more wet-lab data from which improved predictions can be made. Recursion is well positioned compared to companies of a similar stage either focused more specifically on the wet-lab only (traditional biotech or pharma companies) or dry-lab only (companies facing rapidly commoditized algorithms and a challenge differentiating on non-proprietary data).
3.
Recursion has achieved a significant scale with respect to its scientific, technological, and business endeavors. With eight clinical-stage programs, an exciting preclinical pipeline, four of the largest discovery partnerships in the biopharma industry with Roche-Genentech, Sanofi, Bayer and Merck KGaA, and four technology-focused partnerships, Recursion has achieved a scale, level of integration, and stage that few other TechBio companies have.

Table of Contents
We leverage the Recursion OS to deliver value in three ways: 1) our own pipeline of clinical and preclinical potential medicines focused in precision oncology, rare disease and other niche areas of unmet need; 2) by discovering new medicines with large biopharmaceutical companies in some of the biggest areas of unmet need in medicine like neuroscience and inflammation; and 3) by leveraging our tools, technology and data for the benefit of other partners in targeted and limited ways.
We are actively advancing key catalysts in our clinical pipeline while demonstrating significant progress in addressing high unmet medical needs. At the same time, we continue to validate various components of the Recursion OS, which has played a role in advancing every program in our portfolio, reinforcing its potential to accelerate drug discovery and development.

Financing and Operations
We were incorporated in November 2013. In 
April 2021
, we closed our Initial Public Offering (IPO) and issued 
27.9 million
 shares of Class A common stock at a price of $18.00 per share, raising net proceeds of 
$462.4 million
. Prior to our IPO, we had raised 
$448.9 million
 in equity financing from investors in addition to 
$30.0 million 
in an upfront payment from our collaboration with Bayer AG (Bayer). In 
January 2022
, we received an upfront payment of 
$150.0 million
 from our collaboration with Roche. 
See Note 9, “Collaborative Development Contracts” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the collaboration with Roche. In October 2022, we issued 15.3 million shares of our Class A common stock at a purchase price of $9.80 per share in the 2022 private placement to qualified institutional buyers and institutional accredited investors for net proceeds of $143.7 million, after deducting 
169
Table of Contents
fees and offering costs of $6.6 million. In July 2023, we issued an aggregate of 7.7 million shares of our Class A common stock at a purchase price of $6.49 per share in the 2023 Private Placement with NVIDIA Corporation for net proceeds of approximately $49.9 million. In 
August 2023
, Recursion entered into an O
pen Market Sales Agreement with Jefferies LLC to provide for the offering, issuance and sale of up to an aggregate amount of $300.0 million of its Class A common stock of which $132.8 million remain available for future sales. The Company has sold approximately 
9.9 million
 shares and received net proceeds of 
$84.0 million
 under the agreement. In June 2024, we issued an aggregate of 35.4 million shares of our Class A Common stock at a purchase price of $6.50 per share and received net proceeds of $216.4 million
, after deducting 
transaction costs of $13.6 million. 
See Note 8, “Common Stock” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the public offering. In 
September 2024, we received a Phenomap acceptance fee of $30.0 million from our collaboration with Roche.
We use the capital we have raised to fund operating and investing activities across platform research operations, drug discovery, clinical development, digital and other infrastructure, creation of our portfolio of intellectual property and administrative support. We do not have any products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenues from product sales. 
We had cash and cash equivalents of 
$594.3 million 
as of December 31, 2024. 
Based on our current operating plan, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months.
Since inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses were $463.7 million, $328.1 million and $239.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, our accumulated deficit was $1.4 billion.
We anticipate that we will need to raise additional financing in the future to fund our operations, including the potential commercialization of any approved product candidates. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate significant product revenue, we expect to finance our operations with our existing cash and cash equivalents, any future equity or debt financings and upfront, milestone and royalty payments, if any, received under current or future license or collaboration agreements. We may not be able to raise additional capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.

•
costs associated with operating our digital infrastructure; and 
•
other direct and allocated expenses incurred as a result of research and development activities, including those for facilities, depreciation, amortization and insurance. 
We recognize expenses associated with third-party contracted services as they are incurred. Upon termination of contracts with third parties, our financial obligations are generally limited to costs incurred or committed to date. Any advance payments for goods or services to be used or rendered in future research and product development activities pursuant to a contractual arrangement are classified as prepaid expenses until such goods or services are rendered. 
Significant components of research and development expense include the following allocated by development phase: Platform, which refers primarily to expenses related to screening of product candidates through hit identification; Discovery, which refers primarily to expenses related to hit identification through development of candidates; and Clinical, which refers primarily to expenses related to development of candidates and beyond. 
For the year ended December 31, 2024, the increase in research and development expenses compared to the prior year was 
driven by our platform and personnel costs as we continue to expand and upgrade our platform, including our chemical technology, machine learning and transcriptomics platform.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, the increase in research and development expenses compared to the prior year was primarily due to increased platform costs as we have expanded and upgraded our capabilities in platform including our chemical technology, machine learning and transcriptomics platform.

stock and $1.0 billion from Class A common stock issuances. See Note 8, “Common Stock” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on Class A common stock issuances. Additionally, as of December 31, 2024, we have received proceeds of $217.0 million from our strategic partnerships. See Note 9, “Collaborative Development Contracts” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on our partnerships.
We noted the change in Exscientia plc’s (Exscientia) cash, cash equivalents and short term bank deposits from 
December 31, 2023 to November 20, 2024, the date of the close of the acquisition, was $184 million. There were no material financings during this period.

The December 31, 2023 amounts from the above table are from Exscientia’s 20-F Annual Filing. We noted that Exscientia reported their results using International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) but that there are no IFRS to U.S. GAAP differences that would impact the measurement of Exscientia’s December 31, 2023 cash and cash equivalents and short term bank deposits amounts. We believe this information is useful to investors as it helps provide additional information on Exscientia’s liquidity prior and up-to the acquisition. We believe that it may provide a more complete understanding of the Company’s liquidity and can facilitate analysis of the Company’s results.

Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies 
Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and expenses in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 
Revenue Recognition
We have generated revenue from our contracts with partners. Our partnerships often contain multiple components, including research and development services, licenses, options to obtain development and commercialization rights and options to obtain additional research and development services. Such arrangements may provide for various types of payments to us, including upfront fees, technical, development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments, licensing fees, option exercise fees and royalty and milestone payments on product sales. Determining how to recognize revenue from these partnerships involves judgment about whether promised goods and services are distinct from one another or should be accounted for as combined performance obligations, how to estimate and allocate various payment streams to performance obligations and how to measure performance on each performance obligation. Because of these judgments, payments are often not commensurate with the timing of revenue recognition.
Our operating revenue has primarily been generated through research and development agreements. Revenue from research and development agreements is recognized as we satisfy the performance obligation by transferring the promised services to the customer. We recognize revenue over time by measuring the progress toward complete satisfaction of the relevant performance obligation using an appropriate input or output method based on the services promised to the customer. This method of recognizing revenue requires us to make estimates to determine the progress towards completion. A significant change in these estimates could have a material effect on the timing and amount of revenue recognized in future periods.
175
Table of Contents
Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets
We have acquired and may continue to acquire significant intangible assets and goodwill in connection with business combinations. Amounts allocated to intangible assets and goodwill are based upon fair value estimates. We make estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable and that of a market participant. These estimates are based on available historical information as well as future expectations and the estimates are inherently uncertain. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair values, the amounts allocated to identifiable intangible assets acquired, future amortization expense and the value of goodwill. 
Accrued Research and Development Expenses
As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our expenses resulting from our obligations under contracts with vendors and clinical research organizations. The financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations, which vary from contract to contract and may result in payment terms that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided under such contracts. Our objective is to reflect the appropriate expenses in our financial statements by matching those expenses with the period in which services are performed and efforts are expended. We account for these expenses according to the timing of various aspects of the expenses and determine accrual estimates by taking into account discussions with applicable personnel and outside service providers as to the progress of clinical trials, or the services completed. During the course of a clinical trial, we adjust our clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from estimates. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on the facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Our clinical trial accruals are dependent upon the timely and accurate reporting of contract research organizations and other third-party vendors. Although we do not expect estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the anticipated status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that are too high or too low for any particular period.
Stock-Based Compensation
We measure stock options and other stock-based awards granted to employees, directors and non-employees based on their fair value on the date of grant and recognize the compensation expense over the requisite service period. We recognize the impact of forfeitures on stock-based compensation expenses as forfeitures occur. We generally apply the straight-line method of expense recognition to awards.
The grant date fair value of stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires inputs for the expected term, stock price volatility, dividend yield and the risk-free interest rate of the options. If any assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model change significantly, stock-compensation for future awards may differ materially compared with the awards granted previously.
Contractual Obligations
The Company’s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations:
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $27.4 million of debt outstanding. This balance is related to notes payable for tenant improvement allowances and the financing agreement for the supercomputer upgrade project. See Note 5, “Leases” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on the supercomputer lease.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $101.2 million of future lease commitments. See Note 5 “Leases” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail on the Company’s leases.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $297.5 million of future purchase obligations, $149.9 million of which are expected to be payable within the next year. These commitments primarily related to third-party research services, materials and supplies for research and development activities.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $53.7 million remaining of its Gates Foundation Private Placement Commitment. Concurrent with the Exscientia’s IPO on October 5, 2021, the Company completed a private 
176
Table of Contents
placement to the Gates Foundation for the sale of 1,590,909 ADSs at the initial offering price of $22.00 per ADS, for gross proceeds of approximately $35.0 million. Under the terms of the Company’s agreement with the Gates Foundation, the Group is committed to spending $70.0 million over a multi-year period to the research, discovery, and development of small molecule anti-infective therapeutics for future pandemic preparedness, with a specific focus on developing therapeutics that can be applied against multiple species of coronaviridae, influenza, and paramyxoviridae (the “Pandemic Preparedness Program”). The Group had incurred $16.3 million relating to the Pandemic Preparedness Program as at December 31, 2024, with a total outstanding commitment of $53.7 million.
Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
See Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements.
Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
Interest rate risk
We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates on our investment portfolio of cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents consisted of money market funds and bank deposits. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in interest rates. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates as of December 31, 2024 would have an insignificant effect on net loss in the ensuing year. 
Foreign currency exchange risk
Our employees and our operations are primarily located in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada and our expenses are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, Great British pounds and Canadian dollars. We also have entered into a limited number of contracts with vendors for research and development services that have underlying payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies. We are subject to foreign currency transaction gains or losses on our contracts denominated in foreign currencies. To date, foreign currency transaction gains and losses have not been material to our financial statements, and we do not have a formal hedging program with respect to foreign currency. A 10% increase or decrease in current exchange rates would not have had a material effect on our financial results during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Recursion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Recursion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive loss, of stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for the year then ended, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company did not maintain, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the COSO because a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting existed as of that date related to the Company not designing and maintaining effective controls over the estimated costs and time to completion and controls to validate the completeness and accuracy of data used to calculate revenue and unearned revenue related to its license agreement.
A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weakness referred to above is described in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. We considered this material weakness in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2024 consolidated financial statements, and our opinion regarding the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting does not affect our opinion on those consolidated financial statements. 
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in management’s report referred to above. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.
180
Table of Contents
As described in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Exscientia plc from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2024. We have also excluded Exscientia plc from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Exscientia plc is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total net loss excluded from management’s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent 27% and 4%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the

consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated

financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
Acquisition of Exscientia plc – Valuation of Platform Technology and In-Process Research and Development
As described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, on November 20, 2024, the Company acquired all of the equity interests of Exscientia plc for $630.1 million. Of the acquired intangible assets, $182.0 million of platform technology and $129.0 million of in-process research and development (IPR&D) were recorded. The fair value of each intangible asset was based on the present value of future discounted cash flows prepared under the multi-period excess earnings method, with the significant inputs being the estimates of future revenues, future expenses, discount rate, and probabilities of technological and regulatory success. 
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of platform technology and IPR&D acquired in the acquisition of Exscientia plc is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of platform technology and IPR&D acquired; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to (a) future revenues, future expenses, and discount rate for platform technology and (b) future revenues, future expenses, discount rate, and probabilities of technological and regulatory success for IPR&D; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the acquisition accounting, including controls over management’s valuation of platform technology and IPR&D acquired. These procedures also included, among others (i) reading the purchase agreement; (ii) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimate of platform technology and 
181
Table of Contents
IPR&D acquired; (iii) evaluating the appropriateness of the multi-period excess earnings methods used by management; (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the multi-period excess earnings methods; and (v) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to (a) future revenues, future expenses, and discount rate for platform technology and (b) future revenues, future expenses, discount rate, and probabilities of technological and regulatory success for IPR&D. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to (a) future revenues and future expenses for platform technology and (b) future revenues, future expenses, and probabilities of technological and regulatory success for IPR&D involved considering (i) the current and past performance of the Exscientia plc business; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the multi-period excess earnings methods and (ii) the reasonableness of the discount rate assumptions for platform technology and IPR&D.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1.    
Description of the Business 
Recursion Pharmaceutical, Inc. (Recursion, the Company, we or our) is a clinical stage TechBio company decoding biology and chemistry to industrialize drug discovery. The Recursion Operating System (OS), a platform built across diverse technologies, enables the Company to map and navigate trillions of biological and chemical relationships within the Recursion Data Universe, one of the world’s largest proprietary biological and chemical datasets. The Company integrates physical and digital components as iterative loops of atoms and bits scaling wet lab biology and chemistry data organized into virtuous cycles with computational tools to rapidly translate 
in silico 
hypotheses into validated insights and novel chemistry. 
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of 
$
1.4
 billion.
 The Company expects to incur substantial operating losses in future periods and will require additional capital to advance its drug candidates. The Company does not expect to generate significant revenue until the Company successfully completes significant drug development milestones or in collaboration with third parties, which the Company expects will take a number of years. In order to commercialize its drug candidates, the Company or its partners need to complete clinical development and comply with comprehensive regulatory requirements. The Company is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties similar to those of other companies of the same size within the biotechnology industry, such as the uncertainty of clinical trial outcomes, uncertainty of additional funding and a history of operating losses.
The Company has funded its operations to date primarily through the issuance of Class A common stock (see Note 8, “Common Stock” for additional details). Additionally, the Company has received payments from its strategic partnerships (see Note 9, “Collaborative Development Contracts” for additional details). Recursion will likely be required to raise additional capital. As of December 31, 2024, the Company did not have any unconditional outstanding commitments for additional funding. If the Company is unable to access additional funds when needed, it may not be able to continue the development of its products or the Company could be required to delay, scale back or abandon some or all of its development programs and other operations. The Company’s ability to access capital when needed is not assured and, if not achieved on a timely basis, could materially harm its business, financial condition and results of operations. 
Recursion believes that the Company’s existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund the Company’s operating expenses and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months.
Note 2. 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Use of Estimates
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those amounts. Significant estimates and assumptions include the estimated progress towards the satisfaction of performance obligations to record revenue, the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, accrued research and development expenses and the fair value of stock-based awards issued.
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Recursion and its wholly-owned subsidiaries that the Company controls. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
189
Table of Contents
Segment Information 
Recursion operates and is managed as a single operating segment. The Company’s chief operating decision maker is its Chief Executive Officer, who allocates resources and assesses performance at the consolidated level.

Concentration of Credit Risk 
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents. These financial instruments are primarily held at several financial institutions that management believes are of high credit quality. Recursion’s primary bank accounts significantly exceed the federally insured limits. 
The Company is dependent on third-party suppliers for certain research and development activities including preclinical and clinical testing. In particular, the Company relies on and expects to continue to rely on a small number of these suppliers. These activities could be adversely affected by a significant interruption to Recursion’s third-party suppliers including a delay in the Company’s preclinical and clinical testing and the supply of certain consumable products and compounds.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash 
Cash and cash equivalents includes bank deposits held in checking accounts and money market funds. Short-term highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase are classified as cash and cash equivalents.
The Company is required to maintain a cash balance in a collateralized account to secure the Company’s credit cards. Additionally, the Company holds restricted cash related to an outstanding letter of credit issued by J.P. Morgan, which was obtained to secure certain Company obligations relating to tenant improvements. Recursion also holds restricted cash as required by a lease agreement.
Property and Equipment 
Property and equipment is carried at acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation. The cost of normal, recurring or periodic repairs and maintenance activities related to property and equipment are expensed as incurred. 
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets. 
The estimated useful lives by asset classification are generally as follows: 
Computer and Office Equipment
5
 years
Lab Equipment
7
 years
Leasehold Improvements
Lesser of 
15
 years or the remainder of the lease
Property and equipment are reviewed for impairment as discussed below under Long-Lived Assets Impairment.

Long-Lived Assets Impairment
The Compa
ny reviews the carrying amounts of long-lived assets, including property and equipment, intangible assets and right-of-use leased assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. In evaluating recoverability, Recursion groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level such that the identifiable cash flows relating to the group are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. The Company then compares the carrying amount of the asset group with the projected undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the asset group. If the undiscounted cash flows of the asset group is lower than its respective carrying value, an impairment charge is recorded as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value.
Goodwill and Indefinite Intangible Assets Impairment
Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate fair value of the consideration transferred in a business combination over the fair value of the assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed. Indefinite-lived intangible assets 
190
Table of Contents
primarily include in-process research and development (IPR&D) acquired in business combinations with indefinite lives. 
The Company performs its annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an interim triggering event occurs that may indicate potential impairment. The Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. Some of the factors considered in the qualitative assessment include general macro-economic conditions, conditions specific to the industry and market, cost factors, the overall financial performance and whether there have been sustained declines in the Company's share price. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or IPR&D is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed.
For its quantitative impairment tests, the Company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, the selection of an appropriate discount rate and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the Company's business plans and a market participant's views. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease projected cash flows and the estimated fair value.

Business Combinations
Results of operations of acquired companies are included in the Recursion results of operations as of the respective acquisition dates. The purchase price of each acquisition is allocated to the net assets acquired based on estimates of their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any purchase price in excess of these net assets is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of purchase price in certain cases may be subject to revision based on the final determination of fair values during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date. Legal costs, due diligence costs, business valuation costs and all other business acquisition costs are expensed when incurred.
Accruals for Research and Development Expenses and Clinical Trials 
As part of the process of preparing its financial statements, the Company is required to estimate its expenses resulting from obligations under contracts with vendors and clinical research organizations. The financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations, which vary from contract to contract and may result in payment terms that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided for under such contracts. The Company’s policy is to record these expenses during the period in which services are performed and efforts are expended. The Company determines accrual estimates by taking into account discussions with applicable personnel and outside service providers as to the progress of clinical trials, or the services completed. During the course of a clinical trial, the Company adjusts its clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from its estimates. The Company makes estimates of its accrued expenses as of each Consolidated Balance Sheet date based on the facts and circumstances known to it at that time. The actual expenses could be different from the amounts accrued.

Leases 
The Company rents facilities under operating lease agreements and recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain lease agreements contain tenant improvement allowances, rent holidays, scheduled rent increases and renewal options. Rent holidays and scheduled rent increases are included in the determination of rent expense. Certain leases also include provisions for variable lease payments which are based on, but not limited to, maintenance, insurance, taxes and usage-based amounts. Recursion recognizes these costs as they are incurred. 
Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at the lease commencement date. Present value is determined using an incremental borrowing rate when the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. 
The incremental borrowing rate is equal to the rate of interest that Recursion would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term in an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. 
Renewals are not included in the determination of the lease term unless they are determined to be reasonably certain to be exercised at the commencement date of the 
191
Table of Contents
lease. The Company recognizes rent expense beginning on the date the Company obtains the legal right to use and control the leased space. 
Recursion classifies leases as operating or finance at the lease commencement date. 
The Co
mpany has elected to apply the practical expedient for short-term leases whereby Recursion does not recognize a lease liability and right-of-use asset for leases with a term of less than 12 months. The Company has also elected to not separate consideration in the contract between lease and non-lease components of a contract that contains a lease. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are remeasured upon certain remeasurement events using the present value of remaining lease payments and estimated incremental borrowing rate upon lease modification. For operating leases that commenced prior to the Company’s adoption of Topic 842, Recursion measured the lease liabilities and right-of-use assets using the incremental borrowing rate as of January 1, 2022.
Revenue Recognition

Operating revenue has primarily been generated through research and development agreements (see Note 9,

“Collaborative Development Contracts” for additional details). Revenue for research and development agreements is recognized as the Company satisfies a performance obligation by transferring the promised services to the customer. The Company recognizes revenue over time by measuring the progress toward complete satisfaction of the relevant performance obligation using an appropriate input or output method based on the services promised to the customer. This method of recognizing revenue requires the Company to make estimates of the work required to complete the performance obligation in order to determine the progress towards completion. A significant change in these estimates could have a material effect on the timing and amount of revenue recognized in future periods. 
The Company may also provide 
options
 in its agreements under which a partner could request that Recursion provide additional services in the future. Recursion evaluates whether these options are material rights at the inception of the agreement. If the Company determines an option is a material right, Recursion will consider the option a separate performance obligation.

Cost of Revenue 
Cost of revenue consists of the Company’s costs to provide services for drug discovery required 
under
 performance obligations with partnership customers. These primarily include materials costs, service hours performed by the Company’s employees, costs from third party contract research organizations and depreciation of property and equipment. Consumables purchased to be used in the future to satisfy performance obligations are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet until consumed.

Research and 
Development

Research and development expenses comprise of costs incurred in performing research and development activities other than those performed pursuant to contracts with customers, including drug discovery and development studies, external research and the purchase of laboratory supplies. The Company recognizes expenses associated with third-party contracted services based on the completion of activities as specified in the applicable contracts. Upon the termination of contracts with third-parties, the Company’s financial obligations are generally limited to costs incurred or committed to date. Any advance payments 
for

goods
 or services to be used or rendered in future research and product development activities are classified as prepaid expenses until the goods or services are rendered.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company
 issues stock-based awards to employees and non-employees, generally in the form of stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs). Most of the Company’s stock-based awards have been made to employees. Recursion measures compensation expense for equity awards at their grant-date fair value and recognizes compensation expense over the requisite service period, generally on a straight-line basis. For stock-based awards with a performance 
condition
, Recursion recognizes stock-based compensation expense based on the probable outcome of the performance condition. Awards generally vest over 
four years
 for employees. Recursion recognizes the impact of forfeitures on stock-based compensation expense as they occur.
The grant date fair value of stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires inputs for the expected term, stock price volatility, dividend yield and the risk-free interest rate of the options. The 
192
Table of Contents
expected term is based on the simplified method since the Company does not have sufficient historical exercise data to estimate the expected term. The volatility is based on an average peer historical volatility over the expected term of the option. The expected dividend yield is assumed to be 
zero
 as Recursion has never paid dividends and does not have current plans to pay dividends. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rates available at the time of the grant for zero-coupon U.S. government issues with a remaining term equal to the option's expected term.
The grant date fair value of RSUs is determined using the market price of the Company’s common stock at grant date. For stock-based awards with a market condition, the grant date fair value is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation and stock-based compensation expense is recognized using the accelerated attribution method over the implied service period. When a market condition is satisfied in a period before the end of the implied service period, any remaining unrecognized compensation cost is recognized. Stock-based compensation is recorded in cost of revenue, research and development expense and general and administrative expense based on the role of the employee.
Income Taxes 
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pretax losses based on current tax laws. Deferred taxes are recognized using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences, which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. 
For uncertain tax positions, Recursion determines whether the position is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position. Any tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured and recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. 
Recursion receives certain cash refundable research and development tax credits including the research and development expenditure credit (RDEC) in the United Kingdom. The Company records these as “Research and Development” in the Consolidated 
Statements of Operations as the credit is earned.
 The amount included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the 
year ended December 31, 2024
 was insignificant. The Company records the amount receivable in “Other receivables” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
Foreign Currency 
The functional currency for several of Recursion’s foreign subsidiaries is the applicable local currency. Revenues and expenses for non-U.S. dollar functional currency entities are translated into U.S. dollars using average currency exchange rates for the period. Assets and liabilities for such entities are translated using exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Foreign currency translation adjustments are reflected in stockholders’ equity as a component of other comprehensive loss. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses on transactions not denominated in functional currency are recorded in “Other income, net” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-7, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280)
. The standard requires new disclosures related to ASC 280 including: disclosing significant segment expenses by category, requiring all the ASC 280 disclosures for companies with a single reportable segment and requiring ASC 280 disclosures for interim financial statements. Recursion adopted the standard for the annual period ending December 31, 2024. Recursion applied the amendments retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented. The adoption of this standard did not impact Recursion’s consolidated balance sheet and statement of operations.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2024-03, 
Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses (Topic 220)
. The standard requires new disclosures in 
193
Table of Contents
the notes to the financial statements about certain caption expenses presented on the face of the Income Statement including information on: purchases of inventory; employee compensation; depreciation and intangible asset amortization. Recursion must also disclose a qualitative description of the amounts remaining in expense captions that are not separately disaggregated. This standard will be effective for Recursion starting the annual period ending December 31, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments can be applied on a prospective or retrospective basis. Recursion is currently assessing the impact of adopting this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.
In March 2024, the SEC issued rule 33-11275, 
The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors
. The new rule requires Recursion to provide certain disclosures in the footnotes to the financial statements of climate-related information. These disclosures include the impact of severe weather and other natural conditions on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet and statement of operations, to the extent they are material. Recursion will also need to disclose a rollforward of the beginning and ending balances of its carbon offsets and renewable energy credits or certificates (RECs), if they are a material component of meeting the Company’s climate-related targets and goals. Additionally, the Company will need to disclose whether and, if so, how severe weather events and other natural conditions and disclosed climate-related targets or transition plans materially affected estimates and assumptions in the financial statements. The final rule’s effective dates, if adopted, will be phased in depending on the disclosure requirement starting the annual period ending December 31, 2025. In April 2024, the SEC voluntarily stayed implementation of the new climate-related disclosure requirements pending judicial review. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this rule will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-9, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740)
. The new standard updates disclosure requirements for Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740 primarily by requiring additional information in the income tax rate reconciliation and additional disclosures about income taxes paid. This standard will be effective for Recursion starting the annual period ending December 31, 2025. The amendments can be applied on a prospective or retrospective basis. The adoption of this standard will not impact Recursion’s consolidated balance sheet and statement of operations.
Note 3.    
Supplemental Financial Information 
Tempus agreement
In November 2023, Recursion entered into a 
five-year
 agreement (the Tempus Agreement) with Tempus Labs, Inc. (“Tempus”) to purchase access to their records of patient-centric multimodal oncology data and use rights for therapeutic development purposes. This data will be used to improve the training of Recursion’s artificial intelligence and machine learning models and is expected to accelerate Recursion’s drug discovery process. Recursion is making annual payments, ranging between $
22.0
 million and $
42.0
 million, up to $
160.0
 million in aggregate, to Tempus in cash or equity at the Company’s option. The equity value is determined by using the 
seven
-trading day period dollar volume-weighted average price (VWAP) for Recursion Class A common stock ending on the day immediately preceding the date that is 
five
 business days prior to the payment date. 
Recursion is expensing the record purchases based on a contractually agreed price as “Research and Development” expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as the records are downloaded. To the extent that the Recursion payments to Tempus are greater than or less than the records purchased amount, Recursion records the applicable amount to “Other Current Assets” or “Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, Recursion had recorded $
29.6
 million within “Other Current Assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet related to the Tempus agreement.

Acquisitions
Exscientia plc
On November 20, 2024, Recursion acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of Exscientia plc (“Exscientia”), a United Kingdom based public company that was registered on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Exscientia is a drug design company utilizing its artificial intelligence platform to efficiently design and develop differentiated medicines for diseases with high unmet patient needs. Their focus is on utilizing their platform to develop best in class molecules with improvements to known or likely points of failure to improve the probability of developmental success. The Company believes the combination of the Recursion and Exscientia platforms and pipelines will position it to be a leader of the AI-enabled drug discovery and development space.
The acquisition of Exscientia was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. The consideration transferred of approximately $
630.1
 million consisted of $
616.9
 million in Recursion Class A shares and $
13.2
 million related to the portion of Exscientia share based awards that were replaced with Recursion share based awards that is attributable to pre-combination service. Approximately 
102.1
 million Recursion Class A shares were issued in exchange for Exscientia ordinary shares using a fixed exchange ratio of one Exscientia ordinary share converts to 
0.7729
 Recursion Class A shares (the “Exchange Ratio”). In addition, Recursion replaced all outstanding Exscientia share based awards with Recursion share based awards wherein the vesting schedule and other applicable terms were carried over except for the exercise price of share options which were adjusted using the 
0.7729
 exchange ratio. This included Exscientia’s stock options and restricted stock units. Recursion used $
6.04
, the Company’s share price on November 20, 2024 to calculate the consideration transferred. See Note 10, “Stock-Based Compensation” for additional information on the Exscientia share based awards.

Acquired contract liabilities in the scope of ASC 606 are an exception to the ASC 805 fair value measurement principle and were measured as if Recursion had originated the acquired contract. Two acquired customer contracts had contract liabilities and for each contract Recursion reassessed the identification of performance obligations, determination of transaction price, allocation of transaction price, and measure of progress for each performance 
196
Table of Contents
obligation as if Recursion has been party to the original contract and recognized the resulting contract liability as a liability assumed. No contract assets in the scope of ASC 606 were acquired.
The intangible assets of Exscientia consist of the Exscientia artificial intelligence platform and 
four
 clinical stage oncology in process research and development (IPR&D) assets. The operating system is a critical tool used for both designing molecules for fulfilling collaboration agreements and Exscientia’s own research and development projects. The fair value of each intangible asset was valued based on the present value of future discounted cash flows prepared under the multi-period excess earnings method with the significant inputs being the estimates of future revenues, future expenses, the discount rate of 
10.5
% and probabilities of technological and regulatory success. The platform asset is being amortized on a straight line basis ove
r a 
six year
 useful life. The IPR&D assets have been assigned an indefinite useful life and will be tested for impairme
nt prospectively and, if regulatory approval is achieved, will be assigned a useful life and amortization will commence.
Goodwill was calculated based on the excess of the consideration transferred over net assets acquired. The goodwill recognized represents the assembled workforce, future research and development projects enabled by the platform that do not yet have sufficient substance to meet the definition of in-process research and development assets and expected synergies such as the integration of Recursion and Exscientia platforms. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.
As the business combination occurred in November 2024, Recursion is still finalizing the allocation of the purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The preliminary purchase price allocation reflected in the December 31, 2024 balance sheet is based on the current best estimate of management and subject to change. The Company will finalize the amounts recognized as the information necessary to complete the analysis is obtained and management estimates are further refined. The primary areas subject to finalization are the valuation of intangible assets, right-of-use assets, property and equipment and the valuation of tax assets and liabilities. The Company expects to finalize the purchase price allocation soon but will do so no later than one year from the acquisition date. External specialists have been engaged to assist with certain elements of applying the acquisition method of accounting.
Recursion’s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 includes $
1.1
 million of revenue and $
29.3
 million of operating loss from Exscientia operations.

The intangible asset is related to Valence’s ML and AI digital chemistry platform. The estimated fair value of the intangible asset was determined using a cost approach. This valuation technique provides the fair value of an asset based on estimates of the total costs to develop the technology. Significant inputs used to determine the total cost includes the length of time required and service hours performed by Company employees. The technology intangible asset is being amortized on a straight-line basis over its 
four year
 useful life.
Goodwill was calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized. The goodwill recognized represents the assembled workforce and expected synergies, including the ability to: (i) leverage Valence’s digital chemistry platform across Recursion’s business; (ii) leverage Valence’s ML and AI capabilities; (iii) integrate Recursion’s data and operating system into Valence’s platform; and (iv) accelerate Recursion’s pipeline. Goodwill was also impacted by the establishment of a deferred tax liability for the acquired identifiable intangible assets which have no tax basis. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.
Recursion’s consolidated statement of operations does 
no
t include significant revenue generated from Valence’s operations for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. Operating losses associated with Valence’s operations were $

Employee Agreements 
The Company has signed employment agreements with certain key employees pursuant to which, if their employment is terminated following a change of control of the Company, the employees are entitled to receive certain benefits, including accelerated vesting of equity incentives. 
Legal Matters 
The Company may, from time to time, be involved in various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business. An unfavorable resolution of any such matter could materially affect the Company’s future financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
In April 2024, a putative class action complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against Exscientia plc, Andrew Hopkins, Ben R. Taylor and David Nicholson (
Campanile v. Exscientia plc, 
Case No. 1:24-cv-05692). In June 2024, a separate complaint was filed against the same defendants in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey (Case 1:24-cv-07181). Both complaints allege that the defendants violated federal securities laws by, among other things, making materially false and misleading statements regarding Exscientia’s business, operations, and prospects. The complaints seek unspecified compensatory damages, as well as an award of reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs, on behalf of persons and/or entities which purchased Exscientia securities between March 2022 and February 2024. The cases were consolidated and plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on November 11, 2024 against Exscientia plc, Andrew Hopkins, and David Nicholson, and the Company moved to dismiss on January 21, 2025. That motion remains pending. 
As of December 31, 2024
, the Company had 
no
 liability recorded for these events as an unfavorable outcome was not probable.
In February 2021, the Company entered into a lease agreement for laboratory and office space (the Industry Lease) with Industry Office SLC, LLC (the landlord). In March 2023, the Company sent a letter to the landlord detailing numerous construction delays and irregularities, deficiencies and deviations from applicable structural drawings and/or non-conforming conditions with applicable building codes. On June 23, 2023, the landlord filed a lawsuit against the Company (
Industry Office SLC, LLC v. Recursion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
, Case No. 230904627), amended in October 2023, in the Third District Court for Salt Lake County, State of Utah (the Court), alleging anticipatory repudiation, breach of contract, and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and seeks monetary damages and attorney’s fees. 
As of December 31, 2024
, the Company had 
no
 liability recorded for these events as an unfavorable outcome was not probable.
In connection with the Industry Lease, in September 2023, the Company filed claims in the Court against the landlord alleging, among other things, breach of contract and fraudulent misrepresentation (the Counterclaims). In October 2023, the landlord filed an answer and denied the Company’s allegations asserted in the Counterclaims. The Company and the landlord are currently engaged in discovery. The Company is unable to estimate the possible amount or range of amounts associated with the Counterclaims. 
Pledged Assets
As of 
December 31, 2024
, assets pledged as collateral against finance leases totaled $
24.1
 million. Assets pledged as collateral are Lab Equipment reported in “Property and Equipment, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of 
December 31, 2024
, the liabilities associated with collateral pledged were solely comprised of a finance lease and had a carrying value of $
26.6
 million. The collateral pledged under the lease agreement may only be operated by the Company within the continental United States and must maintain a good title. The assets cannot be sold, disposed of or repledged by the Company.

Class A and B Common Shares Authorization
In 
April 2021
, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized 
two
 classes of common stock, Class A and Class B. The rights of the holders of Class A and B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting and conversion. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to 
one
 vote per share. Each share of Class B common stock is entitled to 
10
 votes per share and is convertible at any time into 
one
 share of Class A common stock.
All Class B common stock is held by Christopher Gibson, Ph.D., the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO), or his affiliates. As of December 31, 2024, Dr. Gibson and his affiliates held outstanding shares of Class B common stock representing approximately 
15
% of the voting power of the Company’s outstanding shares. This voting power may increase over time as Dr. Gibson vests in and exercises equity awards outstanding. If all the exchangeable equity awards held by Dr. Gibson had been fully vested, exercised and exchanged for shares of Class B common stock as of December 31, 2024, Dr. Gibson and his affiliates would hold approximately 
16
% of the voting power of the Company’s outstanding shares. As a result, Dr. Gibson will be able to significantly influence any action requiring the approval of Recursion stockholders, including the election of the Board of Directors; the adoption of amendments to the Company’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws; and the approval of any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets, or other major corporate transaction.

Collaborative Development Contracts 
Sanofi
Description
In January 2022, the Company and Sanofi entered into a collaboration agreement to develop an AI-driven pipeline of precision-engineered medicines. The research is focused on up to 
15
 novel small molecule candidates across oncology and immunology and utilizes the Company’s AI platform. The Company is leading small molecule drug design and lead optimization activities with Sanofi assuming responsibility for preclinical and clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization.
Pricing
The Company received a $
100.0
 million non-refundable upfront payment. The Company has also received multiple milestone payments related to this agreement of approximately $
23.0
 million. These related to the advancement of several of the discovery programs within the collaboration and the addition of an existing Company program into the collaboration. Recursion is eligible for additional milestone payments based on performance progress of the collaboration and tiered royalties ranging from high-single-digits to mid-teens. Recursion could earn a maximum of $
555.0
 million from all research milestones and $
1.8
 billion from all development and regulatory milestones.
Accounting
In November 2024, Recursion acquired Exscientia as part of an acquisition. See Note 4, “Acquisitions” for additional information. As such, the initial Recursion accounting analysis for this transaction was done as of the business combination date as if Recursion had originated the contract. This agreement represents a transaction with a customer and therefore is accounted for in accordance with ASC 606. Recursion has determined that it has at least 
eight
 performance obligations related to the small molecule projects. These performance obligations are for performing research and development services for Sanofi to design small molecules and perform lead optimization activities. The performance obligations also include potential licenses related to the intellectual property. The Company concluded that licenses within the contract are not distinct from the research and development services as they are interrelated due to the fact that the research and development services significantly impact the potential licenses. Any additional services are considered customer options and will be considered as separate contracts for accounting purposes.
The Company has determined the transaction price to be $
137.0
 million, for the initial performance obligations, comprised of the upfront payment, several milestones that have been achieved and estimated additional target exercises. Recursion will fully constrain the amounts of remaining variable consideration to be received from potential milestones considering the stage of development and the risks associated with the remaining development required to achieve each milestone. Recursion will re-evaluate the transaction price each reporting period. 
208
Table of Contents
The transaction price was generally allocated to the performance obligations based on the estimated relative stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation as determined using an expected cost plus margin approach. The milestone fees were allocated to related performance obligation as the terms of the variable consideration related specifically to Recursion’s efforts to satisfy the related performance obligation. The Company recognizes revenue over time based on costs incurred relative to total expected costs to perform the research and development services. Recursion determined that this method provides a faithful depiction of the transfer of control to the customer. This method of recognizing revenue requires the Company to make estimates of total costs to provide the services required under the performance obligations. Significant inputs used to determine the total costs included the number of projects to be performed, the number of substitutions related to those projects, length of time required, service hours performed by Company employees and materials costs. A significant change in these estimates could have a material effect on the timing and amount of revenue recognized in future periods. Recursion is unable to estimate the completion date of the performance obligations due to the current stage of work.
Merck KGaA (Merck)
Description
In September 2023, the Company and Merck entered into a collaboration agreement to discover novel small molecule drug candidates across oncology, neuroinflammation and immunology. The collaboration utilizes the Company’s AI platform and the Company is performing drug design and discovery while Merck will be assuming responsibility for the preclinical and clinical development.
Pricing
The Company received a $
20.1
 million non-refundable upfront payment. Recursion is eligible for additional milestone payments based on performance progress of the collaboration and tiered royalties from the mid-single-digits to low-double-digits. The Company could earn a maximum of $
73.0
 million for discovery, development and sales milestones per product.
Accounting
In November 2024, Recursion acquired Exscientia as part of an acquisition. See Note 4, “Acquisitions” for additional information. As such, the initial Recursion accounting analysis for this transaction was done as of the business combination date as if Recursion had originated the contract. This agreement represents a transaction with a customer and therefore is accounted for in accordance with ASC 606. Recursion has determined that it has

Roche and Genentech
Description
In December 2021, Recursion entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Roche and Genentech (collectively referred to as Roche). Recursion is constructing, using the Company’s imaging technology and proprietary machine-learning algorithms, unique maps of the inferred relationships amongst perturbation phenotypes in a given cellular context with the goal to discover and develop therapeutic small molecule programs in a gastrointestinal cancer indication and in key areas of neuroscience. Roche and Recursion will collaborate to select certain novel inferences with respect to small molecules or targets generated from the Phenomaps for further validation and optimization as collaboration programs. Roche and Recursion may also combine sequencing datasets from Roche with Recursion’s Phenomaps and collaborate to generate new algorithms to produce multi-modal maps from which additional collaboration programs may be initiated. For every collaboration program that successfully identifies potential therapeutic small molecules or validates a target, Roche will have an option to obtain an exclusive license to develop and commercialize such potential therapeutic small molecules or to exploit such target in the applicable exclusive field.
Pricing
In January 2022, Recursion received a $
150.0
 million non-refundable upfront payment from the Company’s collaboration with Roche. In September 2024, Recursion received a $
30.0
 million milestone payment (the “acceptance fee”), which was an acceptance fee related to the first accepted neuroscience Phenomap. Recursion is eligible for additional milestone payments based on performance progress of the collaboration. Each of the Phenomaps requested by Roche and created by Recursion may be subject to either an initiation fee, acceptance fee or both. Such fees could exceed $
250.0
 million for 
16
 accepted Phenomaps. In addition, for a period of time after Roche’s acceptance of certain Phenomaps, Roche will have the option to obtain, subject to payment of an exercise fee, rights to use outside the collaboration the raw images generated in the course of creating those Phenomaps. If Roche exercises its external use option for all 
12
 eligible Phenomaps, Roche’s associated exercise fee payments to Recursion could exceed $
250.0
 million. Under the collaboration, Roche may initiate up to 
40
 programs, each of which, if successfully developed and commercialized, could yield more than $
300.0
 million in development, commercialization and net revenue milestones for Recursion, as well as tiered royalties on net revenue.
Accounting
This agreement represents a transaction with a customer and therefore is accounted for in accordance with ASC 606. Recursion has determined that it has 
three
 performance obligations, 
one
 related to gastrointestinal cancer and 
two
 in neuroscience. These performance obligations are for performing research and development services for Roche to identify targets and medicines. The performance obligations also include potential licenses related to the intellectual property. The Company concluded that licenses within the contract are not distinct from the research and development services as they are interrelated due to the fact that the research and development services significantly impact the potential licenses. Any additional services are considered customer options and will be considered as separate contracts for accounting purposes.
The Company has determined the transaction price to be $
180.0
 million, comprised of the upfront payment and the acceptance fee. Prior to the three months ended September 30, 2024, Recursion had fully constrained the $
30.0
 million variable consideration acceptance fee. As a result of Roche’s acceptance of the neuroscience Phenomap, Recursion is now recognizing the acceptance fee as part of the transaction price over the completion period of one of the neuroscience performance obligations. Recursion has fully constrained the remaining amounts of variable consideration to be received from potential milestones considering the stage of development and the risks associated with the remaining development required to achieve each milestone. Recursion will re-evaluate the transaction price each reporting period. 
The transaction price was generally allocated to the performance obligations based on the estimated relative stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation as determined using an expected cost plus margin approach. The acceptance fee was allocated to one of the neuroscience performance obligations as the terms of the variable consideration related specifically to Recursion’s efforts to satisfy this performance obligation. The Company recognizes revenue over time based on costs incurred relative to total expected costs to perform the research and development services. Recursion determined that this method provides a faithful depiction of the transfer of control to the customer. This method of recognizing revenue requires the Company to make estimates of total costs to 
210

provide the services required under the performance obligations. Significant inputs used to determine the total costs included the length of time required, service hours performed by Company employees and materials costs. A significant change in these estimates could have a material effect on the timing and amount of revenue recognized in future periods. Recursion has estimated the completion of the performance obligations by 2026.
Bayer AG
Description
In August 2020, the Company entered into a Research Collaboration and Option Agreement (the Bayer Agreement) with Bayer AG (Bayer) pursuant to which the Company and Bayer initiated research projects related to fibrosis across multiple organ systems, including the lung, liver and heart. Under the agreement, the Company contributed compounds from its proprietary library and Bayer contributed compounds from its proprietary library and contributed scientific expertise throughout the collaboration. The Company worked with Bayer to identify potential candidates for development. Under the agreement, Bayer had the first option for licenses to potential candidates. 
Pricing
In October 2020, the Company received a $
30.0
 million non-refundable upfront payment. Each such license potentially could have resulted in option exercise fees and development and commercial milestone payments payable to the Company, with an aggregate value of up to approximately $
100.0
 million (for an option on a lead series) or up to approximately $
120.0
 million (for an option on a development candidate), as well as tiered royalties for each such license, ranging from low- to mid-single digit percentages of sales, depending on commercial success.
Accounting
The Company determined that it had 
one
 performance obligation under the agreement, which was to perform research and development services for Bayer. Recursion determined the transaction price to be $
30.0
 million, comprised of the upfront payment. The Company allocated the amount to the single performance obligation. The Company recognized revenue over time by measuring progress towards completion of the performance obligation. This method of recognizing revenue required the Company to make estimates of the total time to provide the services required under the performance obligation. Recursion completed its performance obligation services in 2023.
Additional Revenue Disclosures
Revenue from one customer exceeded 10% of total revenue, and that one customer represented primarily all of Recursion’s operating revenue during the year ended December 31, 2024. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, revenue from two customers exceeded 10% of total revenues and those two customers represented primarily all of Recursion’s operating revenue.
Of the revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2024, $
32.5
 million was included in the unearned revenue balance as of December 31, 2023, and was related to the upfront payments received by the Company for the Roche agreement. Of the revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily all of it was included in the unearned revenue balance as of December 31, 2022. Revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily from the upfront payments and acceptance fee received for the Roche agreement. The recognition of a portion of the upfront payment and acceptance fee decreased the unearned revenue recognized. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $
7.9
 million of costs incurred to fulfill a contract on its Consolidated Balance Sheet within “Other Current Assets.”
Unearned revenue was classified as short-term and long-term on the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the Company’s estimate of revenue that will be recognized during the next twelve months.

Note 10. 
Stock-Based Compensation 
In April 2021, the Board of Directors and the stockholders of the Company adopted the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2021 Plan). The Company may grant stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs), stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards and other forms of stock-based compensation. As of December 31, 2024,

Significant judgment is required in determining the Company’s provision for income taxes, recording valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and evaluating the Company’s uncertain tax positions. Due to net losses since inception and the uncertainty of realizing the deferred tax assets, the Company has a full valuation allowance against all entities in a net deferred tax asset position. To the extent that the Company generates positive income and expects, with reasonable certainty, to continue to generate positive income, the Company may release all, or a portion of, the valuation allowance in a future period. This release would result in the recognition of all, or a portion of, the Company’s deferred tax assets, resulting in a decrease to income tax expense for the period such release is made. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023 the Company’s valuation allowance was $
466.1
 million and $
304.6
 million, respectively, which increased by approximately $
161.5
 million and $
137.8
 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
Net operating losses (NOLs) and tax credit carry-forwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and may become subject to annual limitation due to ownership changes that occur under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended and similar state provisions. These ownership changes may limit the amount of carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain shareholders or public groups in the stock of a corporation by more than 50% over a three-year period. As of December 31, 2024, the Company was not limited on its NOLs and tax credit carry-forwards. The Company will continue to monitor future ownership changes for potential Section 382 limitations
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had federal NOL carryforwards of $
553.2
 million and $
412.0
 million, respectively, available to reduce taxable income, of which $
16.3
 million expire beginning 2036 and $
536.9
 million do not expire. The Company had state NOL carryforwards of $
1,499.3
 million and $
398.6
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, available to reduce future state taxable income, of which $
1,042.2
 million expire beginning 2031 and $
457.1
 million do not expire. The Company had foreign NOL carryforwards of $
439.5
 million as of December 31, 2024, available to reduce future foreign taxable income, of which $
18.7

expire beginning 2032 and $
420.8

As of December 31, 2024, the Company also had federal, state and foreign research and development credit carryforwards of $
35.1
 million, $
10.2
 million and $
7.1
 million respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had federal, state and research and development credit carryforwards of $
30.3
 million, $
6.9
 million. The federal 
215
Table of Contents
research and development credit carryforwards expire beginning in 2036, the state credit carryforwards expire beginning in 2030 and the foreign credit carryforwards do not expire. The Company also had federal Orphan Drug credits of $
24.7
 million and $
17.9
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which will begin expiring in 2026.

The Company recognizes benefits of uncertain tax positions if it is more likely than not that such positions will be sustained upon examination based solely on their technical merits, as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon the ultimate settlement. It is the Company’s policy to include penalties and interest expense related to income taxes as a component of Other income (loss), net as necessary. 
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Austria. The Company files state income tax returns in multiple states in the United States among others Utah, California and Massachusetts. The Company is not currently under examination in any of these jurisdictions. The Company is subject to income tax examinations on all federal returns since the 2016 tax return.

Note 13. 
Net Loss Per Share 
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, Recursion calculated net loss per share of Class A, Class B and Exchangeable common stock using the two-class method. Basic net loss per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares and the effect of potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of stock options and other contingently issuable shares. For periods presented in which the Company reports a net loss, all potentially dilutive shares are anti-dilutive and as such are excluded from the calculation. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company reported a net loss and therefore basic and diluted loss per share were the same.
The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of the Company’s Class A, Class B and the Exchangeable common stock are identical, except with respect to voting. As a result, the undistributed earnings for each period are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class A, Class B common stock and the Exchangeable common stock as if the earnings for the period had been distributed. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis and the resulting amount per share for Class A, Class B and Exchangeable common stock was the same during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. 
The following tables set forth the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share of Class A, Class B and Exchangeable common stock during 2024, 2023 and 2022:

Fair Value Measurements
The fair value hierarchy consists of the following three levels:
•
Level 1 — Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets that the company has the ability to access;
•
Level 2 — Valuations based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in the market; and
•
Level 3 — Valuations using significant inputs that are unobservable in the market and include the use of judgment by the company's management about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
The following tables summarize the Company’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

Segment Information
Segment loss
Recursion operates as a single operating segment that is managed on a consolidated basis. The Company’s chief operating decision maker is its Chief Executive Officer. The Company’s chief operating decision maker uses segment net loss to evaluate the performance of its segment, analyze financial trends, compare the budget to the actual operating results, and make resource allocation decisions. Segment net loss represents the Company’s consolidated net loss. All corporate costs, global function support costs, overhead costs and other shared costs are included within this segment. Other segment items primarily include general and administrative expenses including facilities, information technology, professional fees (including auditing, tax and legal) and insurance.

Recursion generates revenue primarily from a single service, research and development services and from a single geographic area, the United States, therefore, the Company does not report additional information on revenue from external customers.
Note 16. 
Subsequent Events
In February 2025, the Company terminated the Sales Agreement and entered into a Sales Agreement (the Citi Sales Agreement) with Citigroup Capital Markets Inc. (the Citi Sales Agent), to provide for the offering, issuance and sale of up to an aggregate amount of $
500.0
 million of its Class A common stock from time to time in “at-the-market” offerings (the Citi ATM Offering). Recursion has not yet sold any shares and is not required to sell additional shares under the Citi Sales Agreement. The Company pays the Citi Sales Agent a commission of up to 
3
% of the aggregate gross proceeds received from all sales of Class A common stock less certain agreed credits and reimbursements. The Citi Sales Agreement continues until the earlier of selling all shares available under the Citi Sales Agreement or terminated by written notice from either of the parties.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The Company has established disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act) designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer (our Chief Executive Officer) and principal financial officer (our Chief Financial Officer), to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weakness described below. 
Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives as management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management performed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In performing this assessment, management used the criteria described in 
Internal Control-Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on its assessment, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2024 due to the material weakness described below. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
The Company did not design and maintain effective controls over the estimated costs and time to completion and controls to validate the completeness and accuracy of data used to calculate revenue and unearned revenue related to its license agreement. This material weakness did not result in any misstatements of the Company’s financial statements or disclosures. However, this material weakness could result in a misstatement of the aforementioned account balances or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. 
The Company has excluded Exscientia plc (Exscientia) from its assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business 
220
Table of Contents
combination during 2024. Exscientia is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total net loss excluded from management’s assessment represent approximately 27% of total assets and 4% of total net loss of Recursion’s Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024. 
The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in Part II Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Material Weaknesses in the Excluded Acquired Business
On November 20, 2024, the Company acquired Exscientia and its subsidiaries. Prior to the acquisition, Exscientia management identified the following material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting, which management of the Company concluded continue to exist as of December 31, 2024:
•
Exscientia did not design and maintain effective process and controls; including with respect to consistent review procedures within its financial statement close process, to appropriately analyze, record and disclose accounting matters timely and accurately while maintaining appropriate segregation of duties; and
•
Exscientia did not design and maintain effective information technology general controls for information systems that are significant to the preparation of its financial statements, including controls to verify that conflicting duties were appropriately segregated within such systems, in addition to controls over change management and program development.
The material weakness related to Exscientia’s ineffective process and controls resulted in an immaterial misstatement to unearned revenue and unearned revenue, non-current in Recursion’s Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024. While the Company has undertaken additional compensating processes and controls, the Company is not yet in a position to conclude that the material weaknesses have been remediated as of December 31, 2024. As a result, these material weaknesses could result in a misstatement of Exscientia’s reported financial results, which are consolidated with the Company's results, that would result in a material misstatement to Recursion’s annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. The Company's management is in the process of remediating these material weaknesses.
Management’s Remediation Efforts for Unremediated Material Weaknesses
The following remediation actions have been taken as of December 31, 2024 related to the material weakness described above over the accounting for revenue and unearned revenue related to our license agreement:
•
Improvement of documentation procedures regarding specific inquiries related to the cost model used for revenue recognition and the resulting responses
•
Improvement of documentation for the review of changes in cost model due to responses from inquiries
•
Provided additional documentation for internal reports to validate and support completeness and accuracy of reports
•
Improvement of documentation of these processes was done with the input of our third-party consultants who continue to be involved in the design and enhancement of the revenue recognition policies and procedures
While significant progress has been made to enhance our internal control over financial reporting, Recursion is still designing, implementing and testing these processes, procedures and controls. 
Regarding the material weaknesses described above related to the acquired Exscientia business, Recursion is currently in the process of integrating Exscientia’s operations into our overall system of internal control over financial reporting.
We believe the above actions will be effective in remediating the material weaknesses described above. However, the material weaknesses cannot be considered remediated until remediated controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
For the three months ended December 31, 2024, management was in the process of integrating the internal controls of the acquired business (Exscientia) into Recursion's existing operations as part of planned integration activities. There were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

In February 2025, Recursion terminated the Jefferies Sales Agreement and entered into, effective February 28, 2025, a Sales Agreement (the “Citi Sales Agreement”) with Citigroup Capital Markets Inc. (the “Citi Sales Agent”), pursuant to which the Company may, from time to time, sell up to an aggregate amount of $500.0 million of our Class A common stock through the Citi Sales Agent in an “at-the-market” offering (the “Citi ATM Offering”).

Recursion will pay the Citi Sales Agent a commission of up to 3% of the aggregate gross proceeds Recursion receive from all sales of our Class A common stock under the Citi Sales Agreement.

Citigroup has agreed to credit up to an aggregate amount of $2.3 million for fees and expenses payable by us to Citigroup under the Citi Sales Agreement. The Citi Sales Agreement continues until the earlier of selling all shares available under the Citi Sales Agreement or terminated by written notice from either of the parties.
