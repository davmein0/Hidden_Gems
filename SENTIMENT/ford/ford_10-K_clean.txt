pay to Lender promptly within five (5) days after written notice from Lender that amounts are due and payable under this Note shall constitute
an event or default under this Note. At any time after the occurrence of any such event of default, the indebtedness evidenced by this
Note and/or any note(s) or other obligation(s) which may be taken in renewal, extension, substitution or modification of all or any part
of the indebtedness evidenced thereby and all other obligations of Borrower to Lender howsoever created and existing shall, at the option

entitled to exercise all remedies as provided by law and/or equity.

for payment, demand, notice of dishonor and protest and agrees that (i) any collateral, lien or right of setoff securing any indebtedness
evidenced by this Note may, from time to time, in whole or in part, be exchanged or released, and any person liable on or with respect
to this Note may be released, all without notice to or further reservations of rights against Borrower, any endorser, surety or guarantor
and all without in any way affecting or releasing the liability of Borrower, any endorser, surety or guarantor, and (ii) none of the terms
or provisions hereof may be waived, altered, modified or amended except as Lender may consent thereto in writing.

Borrower hereby agrees to
pay all out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, incurred by Lender in the collection of the indebtedness

further negotiations, modifications, releases, or otherwise incurred by Lender in connection with this Note. As used in this Note, the
term “attorneys’ fees” shall mean reasonable charges and expenses for legal services rendered to or on behalf of Lender

proceedings and/or thereafter at the trial and/or appellate level and/or in pre-judgment and post-judgment or bankruptcy proceedings.

Borrower or shall be applied towards payment of the principal obligation under this Note.

principal or principal and interest shall become overdue for a period in excess of ten (10) days, in addition to such payment, a “late
charge” in the amount of five percent (5%) of such overdue payment shall be paid by Borrower to Lender on demand for the purpose
of defraying the expenses incident to handling such delinquent payments.

rate provided herein shall be increased to a rate which shall be equal to the maximum rate of interest allowable under the laws of the
State of Florida. Venue of any litigation arising in connection with this Note shall be in Palm Beach County, Florida.

To the extent that Lender
receives any payment on account of any of Borrower’s obligations, and any such payment(s) or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated,
declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside, subordinate and/or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other person
or entity under any bankruptcy act, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then, to the extent of such payment(s) received,
Borrower’s obligations or part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continue in full force and effect, as if such
payment(s) had not been received by Lender and applied on account of Borrower’s obligations.

Borrower agrees that this
Note shall be deemed to have been made under and shall be governed by the laws of the State of Florida in all respects, including matters
of construction, validity and performance. If any provisions of this Note shall be deemed unenforceable under applicable law, such provision
shall be ineffective, but only to the extent of such unenforceability, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining
provisions of this Note. All of the terms and provisions of this Note shall be applicable to and be binding upon each and every maker,
endorser, surety, guarantor, all other persons who are or may become liable for the payment hereof and their heirs, personal representatives,
successors or assigns.
