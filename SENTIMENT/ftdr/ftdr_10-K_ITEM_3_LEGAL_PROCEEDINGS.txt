Overview

Frontdoor is the leading provider of home warranties and new home structural warranties in the United States, as measured by revenue, and operates primarily under the American Home Shield and 2-10 HBW brands. Our customizable home warranties help customers protect and maintain their homes, typically their most valuable asset, from costly and unplanned breakdowns of essential home systems and appliances. Our home warranty customers usually subscribe to an annual service plan agreement that covers the repair or replacement of major components of up to 29 home systems and appliances, including electrical, plumbing, HVAC systems, water heaters, refrigerators, dishwashers and ranges/ovens/cooktops, as well as optional coverages for electronics, pools, spas and pumps. Our new home structural warranty business provides value to home builders and owners of new homes by providing coverage, including insurance-backed coverage for workmanship, systems and/or structural failures, as well as other post-construction services. We also offer non-warranty home services via our website and app to our home warranty customers directly and others through partnerships and our subscription-based Frontdoor app. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 2.1 million active home warranties across all brands in the United States.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, we generated revenue, net income and Adjusted EBITDA of $1,843 million, $235 million and $443 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we generated revenue, net income and Adjusted EBITDA of $1,780 million, $171 million and $346 million, respectively. For a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA, see “—Results of Operations—Adjusted EBITDA.”

For the year ended December 31, 2024, our total operating revenue included 78 percent of revenue derived from existing customer renewals, while seven percent and nine percent were derived from new home warranty sales made in conjunction with existing home real estate transactions and direct-to-consumer sales, respectively, and six percent was derived from other revenue channels. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our total operating revenue included 77 percent of revenue derived from existing customer renewals, while eight percent and 11 percent were derived from new home warranty sales made in conjunction with existing home real estate transactions and direct-to-consumer sales, respectively, and four percent was derived from other revenue channels.

2-10 HBW Acquisition

On December 19, 2024, we completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of 2-10 HBW pursuant to a purchase agreement dated June 3, 2024 for aggregate cash consideration of $585 million, subject to certain customary adjustments based on, among other things, the amount of cash, debt, transaction expenses, working capital and regulatory capital in the business of 2-10 HBW as of the closing of the transaction. 2-10 HBW is a leading provider of new home structural warranties that provide home builders insurance-backed coverage and/or administrative services for workmanship, systems and/or structural failures. 2-10 HBW is also a provider of home warranties. See Note 7 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on this acquisition.

2024 Debt Refinancing

We entered into an amendment to our Credit Agreement, which became effective on December 19, 2024, in part, to fund the 2-10 HBW Acquisition. See "—Liquidity and Capital Resources—2024 Debt Refinancing” and Note 12 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our liquidity and the debt refinancing transactions.

Key Factors and Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations

Macroeconomic Conditions

Current macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, high interest rates, the challenging real estate market, and ongoing global geopolitical issues, may affect existing home sales, consumer sentiment or labor availability. These conditions may reduce demand for our services, increase our costs or otherwise adversely impact our business. While these macroeconomic conditions generally impact the United States as a whole, we believe our nationwide presence limits the impact on us of unfavorable economic conditions in any particular region of the United States.

During 2024, as compared to 2023, our financial condition and results of operations continued to be adversely impacted by the following:

•
Challenging real estate market conditions, driven by a decline in the number of home resale transactions, primarily resulting from high interest rates combined with low home inventory levels, continue to constrain demand for home warranties.

•
Consumer sentiment remains mixed as a result of a broad range of current macroeconomic conditions, including pressure on consumer prices and high interest rates. We believe this environment continues to impact demand for home warranties.

•
Our labor, parts and equipment costs continue to be impacted by inflation.

The ultimate implications of the current macroeconomic conditions on our results of operations and overall financial performance remain uncertain. It remains difficult to predict the overall continuing impact these conditions will have on our business as they may reduce demand for our services, increase our costs or otherwise adversely impact our business.

Seasonality

Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations, which drive variations in our revenue, net income and Adjusted EBITDA for interim periods. Seasonal fluctuations are primarily driven by a higher number of HVAC work orders with respect to our home warranty business in the summer months. In 2024, approximately 21 percent, 29 percent, 29 percent and 21 percent of our revenue, approximately 14 percent, 39 percent, 43 percent and four percent of our net income, and approximately 16 percent, 36 percent, 37 percent and 11 percent of our Adjusted EBITDA was recognized in the first, second, third and fourth quarters, respectively.

Effect of Weather Conditions

The demand for our services, particularly our home warranty business, and our results of operations, are affected by weather conditions. Extreme temperatures, typically in the winter and summer months, can lead to an increase in home warranty service requests related to home systems, particularly HVAC systems, resulting in higher costs and lower profitability, while mild temperatures in the winter or summer months can lead to lower home systems claim frequency, resulting in lower costs and higher profitability. For example, favorable weather trends in 2024 as compared to 2023 resulted in a lower number of home warranty service requests per customer in the HVAC trade, which favorably impacted contract claims costs.

While weather variations as described above may affect our business, major weather events and other similar Acts of God, or natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, typhoons, wildfires or earthquakes, typically do not increase our obligations to provide service. Generally, repairs associated with such isolated events are addressed by homeowners’ and other forms of insurance, as opposed to the home warranties that we offer.

Tariff and Import/Export Regulations

Changes in U.S. tariff and import/export regulations may impact the costs of parts, appliances and home systems. Import duties or restrictions on components and raw materials that are imposed, or the perception that they could occur, may materially and adversely affect our business by increasing our costs. For example, rising costs due to blanket tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, or blanket tariffs on goods from countries that are key suppliers of replacement parts for appliances and home systems, could increase the costs of our parts, appliances and home systems.

35

Competition

We compete in the U.S. home warranty category and the broader U.S. home services industry. The home warranty category is highly competitive. While we have a broad range of competitors in each locality and region, we are one of the few companies that provide home warranties nationwide. The broader U.S. home services industry is also highly competitive. We compete against businesses providing non-warranty home services directly and those offering leads to contractors seeking to provide non-warranty home services. The principal methods of competition, and by which we differentiate ourselves from our competitors, are quality and speed of service, contract offerings, brand awareness and reputation, customer satisfaction, pricing and promotions, contractor network and referrals. We believe our nationwide network of qualified professional contractor firms, in combination with our large base of contracted customers, differentiate us from other platforms in the home services industry.

Our new home structural warranty business faces competition from other providers of new home structural warranties and builders that self-insure.

Acquisition Activity

We anticipate that the highly fragmented nature of the home services industry will continue to create strategic opportunities for acquisitions. Historically, we have used acquisitions to grow our customer base in high-growth geographies, and we intend to continue to do so. Most recently, we acquired 2-10 HBW, which provides us more home warranty customers and increased revenue, in addition to opportunities for a new sales channel and a more diversified business portfolio. We have also used acquisitions to enhance our technological capabilities and geographic presence. We may also explore opportunities to make strategic acquisitions that will expand our service offering in the broader home services industry, such as new home structural warranties acquired as part of 2-10 HBW. See “— 2-10 HBW Acquisition” for additional information related to the acquisition.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To supplement our results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we have disclosed non-GAAP financial measures that exclude or adjust certain items. We present within this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow. See “—Results of Operations—Adjusted EBITDA” for a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA and “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Free Cash Flow” for a reconciliation of net cash provided from operating activities to Free Cash Flow, as well as “Key Business Metrics” for further discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period, and Adjusted EBITDA is also a component of our incentive compensation program. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors, analysts and other interested parties useful information to evaluate our business performance as they facilitate company-to-company operating performance comparisons. Management believes Free Cash Flow is useful as a supplemental measure of our liquidity. Management uses Free Cash Flow to facilitate company-to-company cash flow comparisons, which may vary from company to company for reasons unrelated to operating performance. While we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our business, they should be considered as supplemental in nature and are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similarly entitled measures reported by other companies, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.

Key Business Metrics

We focus on a variety of indicators and key operating and financial metrics to monitor the financial condition and performance of the continuing operations of our business. These metrics include:

•
revenue,

•
operating expenses,

•
gross profit,

•
gross profit margin,

•
net income,

•
earnings per share, 

•
Adjusted EBITDA, 

•
Adjusted EBITDA margin,

•
net cash provided from operating activities,

•
Free Cash Flow,

36

•
number of home warranties, and 

•
customer retention rate.

Revenue. 
The majority of our revenue is generated from home warranty contracts entered into with our customers. Home warranty contracts are typically one year in duration. We recognize revenue at the agreed upon contractual amount over time using the input method in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in performing services under the contracts. Our revenue is primarily a function of the volume and pricing of the services provided to our customers, as well as the mix of services provided. Our revenue volume is impacted by new home warranty sales, customer retention and acquisitions. We derive substantially all of our revenue from customers in the United States.

Operating Expenses. 
In addition to changes in our revenue, our operating results are affected by, among other things, the level of our operating expenses. Our operating expenses primarily include contract claims costs and expenses associated with sales and marketing, customer service and general corporate overhead. A number of our operating expenses are subject to inflationary pressures, such as: salaries and wages, employee benefits and healthcare; contractor costs; parts, appliances and home systems costs; tariffs; insurance premiums; and various regulatory compliance costs.

Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin. 
The presentation of gross profit and gross profit margin provides measures of performance which are primarily a function of the revenue drivers discussed above and contract claims costs drivers, primarily contractor costs and parts, appliances and home systems costs. Gross profit is computed by deducting cost of services rendered from revenue. Gross profit margin is computed as gross profit as a percentage of revenue.

Net Income and Earnings Per Share
. 
The presentation of net income and basic and diluted earnings per share provides measures of performance which are useful for investors, analysts and other interested parties in company-to-company operating performance comparisons. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, increased to include the number of shares of common stock that would have been outstanding had potentially dilutive shares of common stock been issued. The dilutive effect, if any, of non-qualified stock options, performance options (which are stock options that become exercisable upon the achievement, in whole or in part, of the applicable performance goals, pursuant to the terms of the Omnibus Plan and the award agreement), restricted stock units ("RSUs"), performance shares (which are contractual rights to receive a share of our common stock (or the cash equivalent thereof) upon the achievement, in whole or in part, of the applicable performance goals, pursuant to the terms of the Omnibus Plan and the award agreement) and restricted stock awards ("RSAs") are reflected in diluted earnings per share by applying the treasury stock method.

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin. 
We evaluate our operating and financial performance primarily based on Adjusted EBITDA, which is a financial measure not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before: depreciation and amortization expense; goodwill and intangibles impairment; restructuring charges; acquisition-related costs; provision for income taxes; non-cash stock-based compensation expense; interest expense; loss on extinguishment of debt; and other non-operating expenses. We define “Adjusted EBITDA margin” as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are useful for investors, analysts and other interested parties as they facilitate company-to-company operating performance comparisons by excluding potential differences caused by variations in capital structures, taxation, the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment, restructuring and acquisition initiatives and equity-based, long-term incentive plans.

Net Cash Provided from Operating Activities and Free Cash Flow.
 We focus on measures designed to monitor cash flow, including net cash provided from operating activities and Free Cash Flow. Free Cash Flow is a financial measure that is not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and represents net cash provided from operating activities less property additions.

Number of Home Warranties and Customer Retention Rate. 
We report on our number of home warranties and customer retention rate as measurements of our operating performance. These measurements are presented on a rolling 12-month basis in order to avoid seasonal anomalies. The number of home warranties is representative of our recurring home warranty customer base and is measured as the number of customers with active contracts as of the respective period-end date. Our customer retention rate is calculated as the ratio of the number of end-of-period home warranty contracts to the sum of the number of beginning-of-period home warranty contracts and the number of new home warranty sales and acquired accounts during the respective period.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

This “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” is based upon the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to: revenue recognition; business combinations; home warranty claims accruals; the valuation of property and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets; useful lives for recognizing depreciation and amortization expense; accruals for current and deferred tax accounts; stock-based compensation expense; and litigation matters. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

We believe the following accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most significant estimates and judgments.

Business Combinations

We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method, the purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to the acquired tangible and identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values at the time of the acquisition. This allocation involves a number of assumptions, estimates and judgments that could materially affect the timing or amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements. In developing estimates of fair values for long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, we utilize a variety of inputs including forecasted cash flows, anticipated growth rates, discount rates, customer attrition, royalty rates, estimated replacement costs and depreciation and obsolescence factors. Determining the fair value for tangible assets such as real and personal property and specifically identified intangible assets such as customer lists and developed technology involves judgment. We may refine our estimates and make adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed over a measurement period, not to exceed one year. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or the final determination of the values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recognized to the consolidated statements of operations.

See Note 7 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

Home Warranty Claims Accruals

Home warranty claims costs are expensed as incurred. Accruals for home warranty claims are made using internal actuarial projections, which are based on current claims and historical claims experience. Accruals are established based on estimates of the ultimate cost to settle claims. Home warranty claims take approximately three months to settle, on average, and substantially all claims are settled within six months of incurrence. The amount of time required to settle a claim can vary based on a number of factors, including whether a replacement is ultimately required. In addition to our estimates, we engage a third-party actuary to perform an accrual analysis utilizing generally accepted actuarial methods that incorporate cumulative historical claims experience and information provided by us. We regularly review our estimates of claims costs along with the third-party analysis and adjust our estimates when appropriate. We believe the use of actuarial methods to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these judgmental accruals. However, the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved. For example, industry-wide parts and equipment availability challenges and inflation can impact our ability to estimate the cost to settle claims. We believe our recorded obligations for these expenses are consistently measured. Nevertheless, changes in claims costs can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized and are subject to assessment for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if circumstances indicate a potential impairment. We perform our annual assessment for impairment on October 1 of every year. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company can elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the reporting unit does not pass the qualitative assessment, or if the Company does not elect to perform the initial qualitative assessment, then the reporting unit’s carrying amount is compared to its fair value. The fair values of the reporting units are estimated using market and discounted cash flow approaches. The discounted cash flow approach uses expected future operating results. The market approach uses comparable company information to determine revenue and earnings multiples to value our reporting units. Failure to achieve these expected results or market multiples may cause a future impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are considered impaired if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value.

38

As of December 31, 2024, we do not believe there are any circumstances that would indicate any other potential impairment of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets. We will continue to monitor the macroeconomic impacts on our business in our ongoing evaluation of potential impairments.

Newly Issued Accounting Standards

New accounting rules and disclosure requirements can significantly impact our reported results and the comparability of our financial statements. See Note 2 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on newly issued accounting standards.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, includes approximately $6 million as a result of the 2-10 HBW Acquisition on December 19, 2024.

Revenue increased four percent for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in renewal revenue reflects improved price realization resulting from our prior pricing actions, offset, in part, by a decline in the number of renewed home warranties. The decrease in real estate revenue reflects a decline in the number of first-year real estate home warranties driven by the challenging real estate market, offset, in part, by higher price realization. The decrease in direct-to-consumer revenue reflects lower price realization resulting from our efforts to drive incremental sales. The increase in other revenue was driven by growth in non-warranty home services, primarily new HVAC sales.

As of December 31, 2024, excluding the 2-10 HBW home warranties acquired on December 19, 2024, the number of home warranties was 1.94 million, the reduction in home warranties was three percent and the customer retention rate was 78.5 percent.

The growth in the number of home warranties as of December 31, 2024 was primarily driven by the 2-10 HBW acquisition, offset, in part, by the challenging real estate market.

Cost of Services Rendered

We reported cost of services rendered of $852 million and $895 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The following table provides a summary of the changes in cost of services rendered:

The impact of change in revenue is driven by growth in non-warranty home services, offset, in part, by the reduction in number of home warranties, other than the 2-10 HBW home warranties acquired on December 19, 2024.

The decrease in contract claims costs primarily reflects the impact of higher trade service fees, which drove a lower number of home warranty service requests per customer and a lower net cost per service request, a favorable weather impact of $8 million, as milder weather drove a lower number of home warranty service requests in the HVAC trade, and continued process improvement initiatives, specifically relating to better cost management across our contractor network. The decrease was offset, in part, by ongoing inflationary cost pressures. Additionally, contract claims costs reflects a $5 million favorable adjustment in 2024 related to the development of prior period claims, compared to a $11 million favorable adjustment in 2023.

Selling and Administrative Expenses

We reported selling and administrative expenses of $612 million and $581 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The following table provides a summary of the components of selling and administrative expenses:

Sales and marketing costs increased primarily due to our investment in marketing associated with our direct-to-consumer channel, offset, in part by, a reduction in costs driven by sales optimization efforts. Acquisition-related costs are driven by the 2-10 HBW Acquisition and represent direct third-party costs, including legal, accounting and financial advisory fees. Other general and administrative costs increased primarily due to increased personnel costs.

Depreciation and Amortization Expense

Depreciation expense was $35 million and $32 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with the increase primarily driven by incremental capital expenditures in the period. Amortization expense was $4 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Restructuring Charges

Restructuring charges were $8 million and $16 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

In 2024, restructuring charges included $7 million of severance costs and $1 million of expenses related to the exit of certain operating leases.

In 2023, restructuring charges included $10 million in non-cash impairment charges related to the operating lease right-of-use assets and related property and equipment of certain of our leased and company-owned facilities as discussed further in Note 6 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, $2 million of professional fees and $3 million of severance costs. The impairment charges were the result of our decision to exit the leased and company-owned properties. The severance costs related to our continued review and optimization of selling, general and administrative expenses.

Interest Expense

Interest expense was $40 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Interest and Net Investment Income

Interest and net investment income was $20 million and $16 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily driven by higher cash and cash equivalents balances.

Loss on Extinguishment of Debt

During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $3 million, which included the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount. See "—Liquidity and Capital Resources—2024 Debt Refinancing” and Note 12 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the debt refinancing transactions. There was no loss on extinguishment of debt recorded in the year ended December 31, 2023.

Provision for Income Taxes

The effective tax rate on income was 24.1 percent and 25.0 percent for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to stock-based compensation, offset, in part, by non-deductible acquisition-related transaction costs.

Net Income

Net income was $235 million and $171 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with the increase primarily driven by the operating results discussed throughout “—Results of Operations” above.

41

Adjusted EBITDA

Adjusted EBITDA was $443 million and $346 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The following table provides a summary of the changes in our Adjusted EBITDA:

The impact of change in revenue is driven by improved price realization, offset, in part, by the reduction in number of home warranties, other than the 2-10 HBW home warranties acquired on December 19, 2024.

The decrease in contract claims costs primarily reflects the impact of higher trade service fees, which drove a lower number of home warranty service requests per customer and a lower net cost per service request, a favorable weather impact of $8 million, as milder weather drove a lower number of home warranty service requests in the HVAC trade, and continued process improvement initiatives, specifically relating to better cost management across our contractor network. The decrease was offset, in part, by ongoing inflationary cost pressures. Additionally, contract claims costs reflects a $5 million favorable adjustment in 2024 related to the development of prior period claims, compared to a $11 million favorable adjustment in 2023.

Sales and marketing costs increased primarily due to our investment in marketing associated with our direct-to-consumer channel, offset, in part by, a reduction in costs driven by sales optimization efforts. Other general and administrative costs increased primarily due to increased personnel costs.

42

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity

A substantial portion of our liquidity needs are due to debt service requirements on our indebtedness. The Credit Agreement contains covenants that limit or restrict our ability, including the ability of certain of our subsidiaries, to incur additional indebtedness, repurchase debt, incur liens, sell assets, make certain payments (including dividends) and enter into transactions with affiliates. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants under the Credit Agreement. We do not believe current macroeconomic conditions will affect our ongoing ability to meet our debt covenants.

Cash and cash equivalents and short- and long-term marketable securities totaled $474 million and $325 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our cash and cash equivalents and short- and long-term marketable securities include balances associated with regulatory requirements in our business. See “—Limitations on Distributions and Dividends by Subsidiaries.” As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the total net assets subject to these third-party restrictions were $184 million and $157 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, there was $2 million of letters of credit outstanding under our $250 million Revolving Credit Facility, and the available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility was $248 million. The letters of credit are posted in lieu of cash to satisfy regulatory requirements in certain states in which we operate. We currently believe that cash generated from operations, our cash on hand and available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2024 will provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations in the short- and long-term.

We closely monitor the performance of our investment portfolio, primarily cash deposits and short- and long-term marketable securities. We regularly review the statutory reserve requirements to which our regulated entities are subject and any changes to such requirements. These reviews may result in identifying current reserve levels above or below minimum statutory reserve requirements, in which case we may adjust our reserves. The reviews may also identify opportunities to satisfy certain regulatory reserve requirements through alternate financial vehicles.

We have a diversified investment strategy for our cash investments and give priority to the major financial institutions that serve as lenders under the Credit Agreement. Generally, our cash deposits may be redeemed on demand and are maintained with major financial institutions with solid credit ratings, although our holdings exceed insured limits in substantially all of our accounts.

We may, from time to time, issue new debt, repurchase or otherwise retire or extend our debt and/or take other steps to reduce our debt or otherwise improve our financial position, gross and net leverage, results of operations or cash flows. These actions may include new debt issuance, open market debt repurchases, negotiated repurchases, other retirements of outstanding debt and/or opportunistic refinancing of debt. The amount of debt that may be issued, repurchased or otherwise retired or refinanced, if any, and the price of such issuances, repurchases, retirements or refinancings will depend on market conditions, trading levels of our debt, our cash position, compliance with debt covenants and other considerations.

2024 Debt Refinancing

On December 19, 2024, we entered into the second amendment to the Credit Agreement, which provides for a $418 million Term Loan A maturing December 19, 2029, an $800 million Term Loan B maturing December 19, 2031 and a $250 million Revolving Credit Facility terminating December 19, 2029. The net proceeds from the transaction were used to repay the Prior Term Loan Facilities, including accrued and unpaid interest, to fund the 2-10 HBW Acquisition, which also closed on December 19, 2024, and to pay related fees and expenses of all these transactions with the remainder designated to fund share repurchases or for other general corporate purposes.

In connection with the second amendment to the Credit Agreement, we repaid all of the then current outstanding principal amounts of the Prior Term Loan Facilities, consisting of $218 million related to the Prior Term Loan A and $368 million related to the Prior Term Loan B, and recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $3 million, which included the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount. Additionally, on December 19, 2024, we amended and restated the Revolving Credit Facility, which carried, and continues to carry, a $2 million balance.

See Note 12 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our indebtedness.

43

2-10 HBW Acquisition

On December 19, 2024, we completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of 2-10 HBW pursuant to a purchase agreement dated June 3, 2024 for aggregate cash consideration of $585 million, subject to certain customary adjustments based on, among other things, the amount of cash, debt, transaction expenses, working capital and regulatory capital in the business of 2-10 HBW as of the closing of the transaction. 2-10 HBW is a leading provider of new home structural warranties that provide home builders insurance-backed coverage and/or administrative services for workmanship, systems and/or structural failures. 2-10 HBW is also a provider of home warranties. See Note 7 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on this acquisition.

Share Repurchase Program

On July 26, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of up to $650 million of our common stock over the three-year period from September 4, 2024 through September 4, 2027. Purchases under this new $650 million repurchase program may be made from time to time by the company in the open market at prevailing market prices (including through a Rule 10b5-1 Plan), in privately negotiated transactions, or through any combination of these methods, through September 4, 2027. The actual timing, number, manner and value of any shares repurchased will depend on several factors, including the market price of the company’s stock, general market and economic conditions, the company’s liquidity requirements, applicable legal requirements and other business considerations. The repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any number of shares in any specific period or at all and may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion. As of December 31, 2024, we repurchased a total of 709,077 outstanding shares at an aggregate cost of $41 million under this program, which is included in treasury stock on the audited consolidated statements of financial position included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We expect to fund future share repurchases from net cash provided from operating activities.

On September 3, 2024, our previous repurchase authorization of up to $400 million expired. We repurchased a total of 11,319,091 shares at an aggregate cost of $400 million under this previous program, which is included in treasury stock on the audited consolidated statements of financial position included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Limitations on Distributions and Dividends by Subsidiaries

We depend on our subsidiaries to distribute funds to us so that we may pay obligations and expenses, including satisfying obligations with respect to indebtedness. The ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions and dividends to us depends on their operating results, cash requirements, financial condition and general business conditions, as well as restrictions under the laws of our subsidiaries’ jurisdictions.

Our subsidiaries are permitted under the terms of the Credit Agreement and other indebtedness to incur additional indebtedness that may restrict or prohibit the making of distributions, the payment of dividends or the making of loans by such subsidiaries to us.

Furthermore, there are regulatory restrictions on the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us. The payments of ordinary and extraordinary dividends by certain of our subsidiaries (through which we conduct our business) are subject to significant regulatory restrictions under the laws and regulations of the states in which they operate. Among other things, such laws and regulations require certain subsidiaries to maintain minimum capital and net worth requirements and may limit the amount of ordinary and extraordinary dividends and other payments that these subsidiaries can pay to us. We expect that such limitations will be in effect for the foreseeable future. None of our subsidiaries is obligated to make funds available to us through the payment of dividends.

Cash Flows

Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the audited consolidated statements of cash flows included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, are summarized in the following table:

Operating Activities

Net cash provided from operating activities was $270 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $202 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Net cash provided from operating activities in 2024 comprised $312 million in earnings adjusted for non-cash charges, offset, in part, by $36 million in cash used for working capital and $6 million in payments for restructuring charges. Cash used for working capital was primarily driven by seasonality, payments of accrued bonuses and a decline in the number of first-year real estate home warranties, which are typically paid for upfront at the time of closing on the home sale.

Net cash provided from operating activities in 2023 comprised $242 million in earnings adjusted for non-cash charges, offset, in part, by $7 million in payments for restructuring charges and $33 million in cash used for working capital. Cash used for working capital was primarily driven by a decline in the number of first-year real estate home warranties, which are typically paid for upfront at the time of closing on the home sale, and favorable development of prior period claims.

Investing Activities

Net cash used for investing activities was $622 million and $32 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Capital expenditures were $39 million and $32 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively, and included recurring capital needs and technology projects. We expect capital expenditures for the full year 2025 relating to committed, recurring capital needs and the continuation of investments in information systems and productivity enhancing technology to be approximately $35 million to $45 million. We have no additional material capital commitments at this time.

We paid $583 million, net of cash acquired, for the 2-10 HBW Acquisition in 2024. See Note 7 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on this acquisition.

Financing Activities

Net cash used for financing activities was $447 million and $137 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, we refinanced our Term Loan Facilities. We borrowed $1,216 million and used a portion of the proceeds to repay $585 million of principal on the Prior Term Loan Facilities. In addition, we made other scheduled principal payments of debt of $13 million and purchased outstanding shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $161 million. Repurchases of common stock included associated commissions and taxes of $2 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2023, we made scheduled principal payments of debt of $17 million and purchased outstanding shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $121 million. Repurchases of common stock included associated commissions and taxes of $1 million.

These amounts represent future payments relating to real estate operating leases.

Financial Position

The 2-10 HBW Acquisition on December 19, 2024 significantly changed certain accounts on our statement of financial position. For a summary of the amounts of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, as determined based on management's preliminary assessment of the acquisition date fair value, see Note 7 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

A summary of the other significant changes in our financial position from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024 is as follows:

•
Cash and cash equivalents increased during 2024, primarily reflecting cash provided from operating activities and the 2024 debt refinancing activities, offset, in part, by capital expenditures and purchases of outstanding shares.

•
Long-term debt, including the current portion, increased during 2024, reflecting the 2024 debt refinancing activities, offset, in part, by scheduled debt payments.

•
Total shareholders’ equity was $239 million as of December 31, 2024 compared to $136 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by net income, offset, in part, by repurchases of our common stock. See the audited consolidated statements of changes in equity (deficit) included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.

ITEM 7A. QUANTI
TATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Changes in macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, higher interest rates, the challenging real estate market and rising global geopolitical issues, may affect existing home sales, consumer sentiment or labor availability. These conditions may reduce demand for our services, increase our costs or otherwise adversely impact our business, which could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations.

We are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and manage this exposure through the use of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt and by utilizing an interest rate swap. We entered into an interest rate swap contract in the normal course of business to manage interest rate risks, with a policy of matching positions. The effect of derivative financial instrument transactions under the agreement could have a material impact on our financial statements. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

On October 24, 2018, we entered into an interest rate swap contract effective October 31, 2018 that expires on August 16, 2025. The notional amount of the agreement is $350 million. Under the terms of the agreement, we will pay a fixed rate of interest of 3.028 percent on the notional amount, and we will receive a floating rate of interest (based on SOFR, subject to a floor of zero percent) on the notional amount. As a result, through August 16, 2025, $350 million of the Amended Term Loan Facilities is fixed at a rate of 3.028 percent, plus the incremental borrowing margin of 2.25 percent.

In connection with the Amended Credit Facility, we entered into an additional interest rate swap contract effective December 19, 2024 that expires on December 31, 2029. The initial notional amount of the agreement is $299 million with additional step up and step down provisions embedded in the contract. The notional amount steps up in August 2025 by $350 million upon the expiration of the company's other interest rate swap contract described above. The notional amount steps down over the term of the agreement on a basis that correlates with the scheduled principal payments on the Amended Term Loan Facilities. Under the terms of the agreement, we will pay a fixed rate of interest of 4.140 percent on the notional amount, and we will receive a floating rate of interest (based on SOFR, subject to a floor of zero percent) on the notional amount. As a result, a portion of the outstanding principal balance on the Amended Term Loan Facilities in an amount that correlates with the then current notional amount of this interest rate swap contract is fixed at a rate of 4.140 percent, plus the incremental borrowing margin of 2.25 percent.

We believe our exposure to interest rate fluctuations could be material to our overall results of operations. A significant portion of our outstanding debt, including indebtedness under the Amended Credit Facilities, bears interest at variable rates. As a result, increases in interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our indebtedness and could materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. As of December 31, 2024, each one percentage point change in interest rates would result in an approximate $6 million change in the annual interest expense on our Term Loan Facilities after considering the impact of the interest rate swap. Assuming all revolving loans were fully drawn as of December 31, 2024, each one percentage point change in interest rates would result in an approximate $3 million change in annual interest expense on our Revolving Credit Facility. The impact of increases in interest rates could be more significant for us than it would be for some other companies because of our significant indebtedness.

The following table summarizes information about our debt as of December 31, 2024 (after considering the impact of the effective interest rate swaps), including the principal cash payments and related weighted‑average interest rates by expected maturity dates based on applicable rates as of December 31, 2024.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGIST
ERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Frontdoor, Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Frontdoor, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, statements of changes in total equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and the schedules listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 27, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Accrual for Home Warranty Claims – Refer to Notes 2 and 9 of the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

The Company maintains an accrual for the cost to complete home warranty claims when the ultimate cost of the claims is not yet known. The estimate is determined using an internal analysis based on current claims and historical claims experience. In addition, the Company engages a third-party actuary to develop an independent estimate of the ultimate costs using generally accepted actuarial methods that incorporate cumulative claims experience and information provided by the Company. The Company regularly reviews its estimates of claims costs and adjusts the estimates, as needed.

We identified the accrual for home warranty claims as a critical audit matter because estimating the cost to complete home warranty claims involves significant estimation by management due to the subjectivity involved in determining loss development factors for outstanding claims, including the impact of underlying business changes and market trends on the ultimate costs. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our actuarial specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the accrual for home warranty claims as of December 31, 2024.

48

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to the home warranty claims accrual included the following, among others:

•
We tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls over the home warranty claims accrual, including those over the Company’s internal analysis to project the ultimate costs associated with settling each claim as well as oversight of the actuary and related assumptions. Additionally, we tested the design and operating effectiveness over the controls covering the completeness and accuracy of the claims data underlying the accrual process.

•
We compared management’s prior periods assumptions of expected development to actual development during the current year and subsequent period to identify potential bias in the determination of the home warranty claims accrual.

•
With the assistance of our actuarial specialists:

▪
We evaluated the methods and assumptions used by management to estimate the home warranty claims accrual.

▪
We developed independent estimates of the home warranty claims accrual and compared our estimate to management’s estimate.

•
We tested the underlying data that served as the basis for the Company’s internal analysis and their actuary’s analysis, including historical claims, to ensure that the inputs to the estimates were complete and accurate.

Frontdoor, Inc.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1. Description of Business
Frontdoor is the leading provider of home warranties and new home structural warranties in the United States, as measured by revenue, and operates primarily under the American Home Shield and 2-10 HBW brands. Our customizable home warranties help customers protect and maintain their homes, typically their most valuable asset, from costly and unplanned breakdowns of essential home systems and appliances. Our home warranty customers usually subscribe to an annual service plan agreement that covers the repair or replacement of major components of up to 
29
 home systems and appliances, including electrical, plumbing, HVAC systems, water heaters, refrigerators, dishwashers and ranges/ovens/cooktops, as well as optional coverages for electronics, pools, spas and pumps. Our new home structural warranty business provides value to home builders and owners of new homes by providing coverage, including insurance-backed coverage for workmanship, systems and/or structural failures, as well as other post-construction services. We also offer non-warranty home services via our website and app to our home warranty customers directly and others through partnerships and our subscription-based Frontdoor app. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 
2.1
 million active home warranties across all brands in the United States.

Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies
Consolidation
Our consolidated financial statements include all of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions required under U.S. GAAP that may differ from actual results. The more significant areas requiring the use of management estimates relate to: revenue recognition; business combinations; home warranty claims accruals; the valuation of property and equipment, marketable securities, goodwill and intangible assets; useful lives for recognizing depreciation and amortization expense; accruals for current and deferred tax accounts; stock-based compensation expense; and litigation matters.
Revenue
The majority of our revenue is generated from home warranty contracts entered into with our customers. Home warranty contracts are typically 
one year
 in duration. Home warranty claims costs are expensed as incurred. We recognize revenue over the life of these contracts in proportion to the expected direct costs. Those costs bear a direct relationship to the fulfillment of our obligations under the contracts and are representative of the relative value provided to our customers. We regularly review our estimates of claims costs and adjust our estimates when appropriate.
Revenues are presented net of sales taxes collected and remitted to government taxing authorities in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.
We record a receivable due from customers once we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to the services provided and anticipate the collection of amounts due to us. We invoice our monthly-pay customers on a straight-line basis over the contract term. As a result, contract assets arise when we recognize revenue for our home warranty contracts prior to a customer being invoiced. Deferred revenue represents a contract liability and is recognized when cash payments are received in advance of the performance of services, including when the amounts are refundable. Amounts are recognized as revenue in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in performing services under our contracts.
Property and Equipment, Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Property and equipment consist of the following:

Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. These lives are based on our previous experience for similar assets, potential market obsolescence and other industry and business data. Property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are tested for recoverability if circumstances indicate a potential impairment. If the carrying amount is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, an impairment loss would be recognized equal to the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. Changes in the estimated useful lives could cause us to adjust the carrying values or future expense accordingly.

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized and are subject to assessment for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if circumstances indicate a potential impairment. We perform our annual assessment for impairment on October 1 of every year. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company can elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the reporting unit does not pass the qualitative assessment, or if the Company does not elect to perform the initial qualitative assessment, then the reporting unit’s carrying amount is compared to its fair value. The fair values of the reporting units are estimated using market and discounted cash flow approaches. The discounted cash flow approach uses expected future operating results. The market approach uses comparable company information to determine revenue and earnings multiples to value our reporting units. Failure to achieve these expected results or market multiples may cause a future impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are considered impaired if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. See Note 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information related to our goodwill and intangible assets.
As part of business combination accounting, a value of business acquired ("VOBA") intangible asset is established upon the acquisition of blocks of contracts. This intangible represents the present value of estimated net cash flows for the in-force contracts as of the acquisition date. VOBA is amortized as a component of depreciation and amortization expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income in relation to the profit emergence of the underlying acquired contracts. The valuation of VOBA is based on many factors including investment yields, expenses and discount rate.
Advertising
We expense advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $
170
 million, $
156
 million and $
115
 million, respectively.
Leases
We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. We recognize a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and lease liability for all leases with terms of 
12
 months or more. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. We use the implicit rate when readily determinable. Our incremental borrowing rate is determined based on our secured borrowing rating and the lease term. Our operating lease ROU assets are recorded net of lease incentives. Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for separately for our real estate leases. See Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information related to our leases.
Restricted Net Assets
There are regulatory restrictions on the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us. The payments of ordinary and extraordinary dividends by our subsidiaries are subject to significant regulatory restrictions under the laws and regulations of the states in which they operate. Among other things, such laws and regulations require certain subsidiaries to maintain minimum capital and net worth requirements and may limit the amount of ordinary and extraordinary dividends and other payments that these subsidiaries can make to us. As of December 31, 2024, the total net assets subject to these regulatory restrictions was $
184
 million.

55

Statutory Financial Information
A subsidiary of 2-10 Holdco, Inc., New Home Warranty Insurance Company, a risk retention group, (the "RRG") is required to prepare statutory financial statements in accordance with the laws and regulations in the state jurisdictions in which it operates. We apply the statutory accounting practices prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) as the basis for accounting in the RRG standalone statutory financial statements. These statutory financial statements are prepared on a calendar year basis. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the RRG reported a statutory net loss of $
1
 million and statutory capital and surplus of $
5
 million. 
No
 dividends were declared or paid by the RRG during 2024. As part of its regulatory filings and pursuant to the Risk-Based Capital (“RBC”) requirements of the NAIC, the RRG is required to maintain a minimum capitalization level, as determined based on formulas and other factors incorporating various business risks of the insurance subsidiary. As of December 31, 2024, the RRG’s statutory surplus exceeded the RBC requirement.

Financial Instruments and Credit Risk
We hedge the interest payments on a portion of our variable rate debt through the use of an interest rate swap contract. We have classified our interest rate swap contract as a cash flow hedge and recorded the hedging instrument in the consolidated statements of financial position as either an asset or liability at fair value. The effect of derivative financial instrument transactions could have a material impact on our financial statements. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
Financial instruments, which potentially subject us to financial and credit risk, consist principally of investments and receivables. Investments consist primarily of certificates of deposit, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities and U.S. government obligations. The Company periodically reviews its portfolio of investments to determine whether there has been an other than temporary decline in the value of the investments from factors such as deterioration in the financial condition of the issuer or the market(s) in which the issuer competes. The majority of our receivables have little concentration of credit risk due to the large number of customers with relatively small balances and their dispersion across geographical areas. We maintain an allowance for losses based upon the expected collectability of receivables. See Note 18 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information relating to the fair value of financial instruments.
Stock-Based Compensation Expense
Stock-based compensation expense for non-qualified stock options is estimated at the grant date based on an award’s fair value as calculated by the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. The Black-Scholes model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected volatility and option life. If any of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model change significantly, stock-based compensation expense for future grants may differ materially from that recorded in the current period related to options granted to date. In addition, we estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. We estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience. To the extent the actual forfeiture rate is different from the estimate, stock-based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly in the period the forfeiture occurs or the awards vest. See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more details, including the calculation of stock-based compensation expense for stock options, performance options, RSUs, performance shares and RSAs.
Income Taxes
Frontdoor files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. State and local returns are filed both on a separate company basis and on a combined unitary basis with Frontdoor. Current and deferred income taxes are provided for on a separate company basis. We account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income during the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when management determines that it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The financial effect of changes in tax laws or rates is accounted for in the period of enactment.

We record a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns. We recognize potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.

56

Newly Issued Accounting Standards
In 2023, the FASB issued 
ASU 2023-07
, Segment Reporting (Topic 280),
 which improves reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 requires disclosure of this incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. This guidance was applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements when we 
adopted
 the provisions of this ASU as of 
December 31, 2024
. See Note 13 for the required disclosures.
In 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09
, Income Taxes (Topic 740),
 which improves income tax disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted, and the guidance should be applied on a prospective basis. Retrospective application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on our enhanced disclosures.
In 2024, the FASB issues ASU 2024-03, 
Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40),
 which requires disclosure, in the notes to the financial statements, of specified information about certain costs and expenses on an annual and interim basis. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted, and the guidance can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on our enhanced disclosures.

Note 3. Revenue
The majority of our revenue is generated from home warranty contracts entered into with our customers. Home warranty contracts are typically 
one year
 in duration. We derive substantially all of our revenue from customers in the United States.

We disaggregate revenue from contracts with customers into major customer acquisition channels. We determined that disaggregating revenue into these categories depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. Revenue by major customer acquisition channel for our home warranties and other revenue is as follows:

First-year revenue only.
Our home warranty contracts have one primary performance obligation, which is to provide for the repair or replacement of essential home systems and appliances, as applicable per the contract. We recognize revenue at the agreed upon contractual amount over time using the input method in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in performing services under the contracts. Those costs bear a direct relationship to the fulfillment of our obligations under the contracts and are representative of the relative fair value of the services provided to the customer. As the costs to fulfill the obligations of the home warranties are incurred on an other-than-straight-line basis, we utilize historical evidence to estimate the expected claims expense and related timing of such costs and make a corresponding adjustment each period to the timing of our related revenue recognition. This adjustment to the straight-line revenue creates a contract asset or contract liability, as described under the heading “Contract Assets and Liabilities” below. We regularly review our estimates of claims costs and adjust these estimates when appropriate.
Renewals
Revenue from customer renewals of home warranty contracts, which were previously initiated in the real estate or direct-to-consumer channel are classified as renewal revenue above. Renewals relate to consecutive contract periods and take place at the end of the first year of a real estate or direct-to-consumer home warranty contract and continue to be categorized in our renewal channel thereafter. Customer payments for renewals are primarily received in installments over the new contract period.

57

Real estate
Real estate home warranties are sold through annual contracts that occur in connection with a real estate sale. These plans are typically paid in full at closing on the real estate transaction. First-year revenue from the real estate channel is classified as real estate above. At the option of the customer, upon renewal of the contract, the future revenue derived from home warranties sold in this channel is classified as renewal revenue as described above.
Direct-to-consumer
Direct-to-consumer home warranties are sold through annual contracts that occur in response to our marketing efforts. Customer payments for direct-to-consumer sales are primarily received in installments over the contract period. First-year revenue from the direct-to-consumer channel is classified as direct-to-consumer above. At the option of the customer, upon renewal of the contract, the future revenue derived from home warranties sold in this channel is classified as renewal revenue as described above.
Other
Other revenue primarily includes revenue generated by non-warranty home services and new home structural warranties, as well as ancillary services attributable to our home warranty contracts.
Deferred Customer Acquisition Costs
We capitalize the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer and recognize the related expense using the input method in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in performing services under the contract, over the expected customer relationship period. Deferred customer acquisition costs were $
11
 million and $
12
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023
, respectively. Amortization of deferred customer acquisition costs was $
12
 million, $
16
 million and $
19
 million for the 
years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. There were 
no
 impairment losses related to these capitalized costs during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.
Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs
We capitalize certain costs related to the issuance of insurance policies under the new home warranty program as deferred policy acquisition costs and amortize these costs over the contract period. We anticipate that all deferred policy acquisition costs will be recoverable. Deferred policy acquisition costs were less than $
1
 million as of December 31, 2024, as the acquired balance from 2-10 HBW was eliminated in purchase accounting.
Receivables, Less Allowance
We record a receivable due from customers once we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to the services provided and anticipate the collection of amounts due to us. Contracts for home warranties may be invoiced upfront or monthly in straight-line installment payments over the contract period. The payment terms are determined prior to the execution of the contract.
Contract Assets and Liabilities
Contract assets arise when we recognize revenue for our home warranty contracts prior to a customer being invoiced. These timing differences are created when the recognition of revenue in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in performing the services under the contract are accelerated as compared to the recognition of revenue on a straight-line basis over the contract period. There were 
no
 contract assets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Our contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue which is recognized when cash payments are received in advance of the performance of services, including when the amounts are refundable. Amounts are recognized as revenue in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in performing services under our contracts.

There was approximately $

Unearned Insurance Premium
New home structural warranty revenue is recognized over the life of the contract in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in performing services under the contract. Amounts not earned and recognized to date are recognized as unearned insurance premium on the consolidated statement of financial position.

Deferred Reinsurance
In the normal course of business, we seek to reduce our loss exposure in the new home warranty program by reinsuring certain levels of risk with reinsurers. Premiums ceded are expensed over the term of underlying insurance policies, and the unexpired portion of reinsurance is deferred and recognized as deferred reinsurance on the consolidated statement of financial position.

Note 4. Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized and are subject to assessment for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if circumstances indicate a potential impairment. We perform our annual assessment for impairment on October 1 of every year.
In connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the third quarter of 2022, we determined that indicators of a potential goodwill and intangible assets impairment were present for our Streem reporting unit. In particular, we began to shift the focus of our Streem technology platform to primarily concentrate on integrating the technology into our core product offerings. We continued to license this technology to third-party business-to-business customers as a software-as-a-service platform but discontinued this third-party business at the end of 2024. This shift in focus resulted in significantly lower projected revenue for Streem. We performed an interim impairment analysis of the Streem reporting unit as of September 30, 2022. In performing the discounted cash flow analysis, we determined that the carrying amount of the Streem reporting unit exceeded its fair value. An impairment charge of $
14
 million was recognized during the third quarter of 2022, which comprised the remaining net carrying amount of Streem’s goodwill of $
9
 million and intang
ible assets of $
5
 million.
The balance of goodwill was $
967
 million and $
503
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we acquired $
464
 million of goodwill in connection with the 2-10 HBW Acquisition. See Note 7 for additional information on the 2-10 HBW Acquisition. There were 
no
 goodwill impairment charges recorded in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Closure of Leased Facilities
In August 2023, we entered into a new lease in Scottsdale, Arizona and subsequently decided to exit our leased facility in Phoenix, Arizona. Additionally, in November 2023, we decided to exit our leased facilities in Seattle, Washington, Portland, Oregon and Denver, Colorado. As a result of exiting these leased facilities during 2023, we incurred non-cash impairment charges of $
5
 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 relating to the corresponding operating lease right-of-use assets.
Sublease of Prior Corporate Headquarters

On August 10, 2022, we subleased our prior corporate headquarters facility in Memphis, Tennessee. As a result of us exiting the facility on June 27, 2022, we incurred a non-cash impairment charge of $
11
 million for the year ended December 31, 2022
.

Note 6. Income Taxes
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022

We are subject to taxation in the United States, various states and foreign jurisdictions. Due to expired statutes, the majority of our U.S. federal, state and local income tax returns for the years prior to 2021 are no longer subject to examination by tax authorities. Substantially all of our income before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was generated in the United States.

Note 7. Acquisition

On 
December 19, 2024
, we completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of 2-10 HBW pursuant to a purchase agreement dated June 3, 2024 for aggregate cash consideration of $
585
 million, subject to certain customary adjustments based on, among other things, the amount of cash, debt, transaction expenses, working capital and regulatory capital in the business of 2-10 HBW as of the closing of the transaction. 2-10 HBW is a leading provider of new home structural warranties that provide home builders insurance-backed coverage and/or administrative services for workmanship, systems and/or structural failures. 2-10 HBW is also a provider of home warranties.
We entered into an amendment to our Credit Agreement, which also became effective on December 19, 2024, in part, to fund the 2-10 HBW Acquisition. See Note 12 for additional information on the debt refinancing transactions.

As of December 31, 2024, the purchase price allocation for this acquisition has not been finalized. In particular, we are still evaluating the fair value of certain intangible assets. As we finalize the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, additional purchase price adjustments may be recorded during the measurement period in 2025.
We recognized $
6
 million of revenue and $
2
 million of net loss during the year ended December 31, 2024 related to the operations of 2-10 HBW for the period from December 19, 2024 through December 31, 2024.

63

In conjunction with the 2-10 HBW Acquisition, we recognized acquisition-related costs of $
17
 million during the year ended December 31, 2024. These charges represent direct third-party costs, including legal, accounting and financial advisory fees and are included in selling and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.
A summary of unaudited pro forma financial information related to our consolidated operating results as if the 2-10 HBW Acquisition occurred as of 
January 1, 2023 is as follows:

The unaudited pro forma financial information reflects pro forma adjustments to give effect to certain events management believes to be directly attributable to the acquisition. These pro forma adjustments include amortization and depreciation on acquired property and equipment and intangible assets. Additionally, the debt refinancing transactions that occurred contemporaneously with the closing of the 2-10 HBW acquisition are assumed to have occurred on January 1, 2023
, and historical interest expense associated with repaid borrowings associated with the Prior Credit Facilities have been removed.

Note 8. Restructuring Charges
We incurred restructuring charges of $
8
 million ($
6
 million, net of tax), $
16
 million ($
12
 million, net of tax) and $
20
 million ($
15
 million, net of tax) for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

In 2024, restructuring charges included $
7
 million of severance costs and $
1
 million of expenses related to the exit of certain operating leases.
In 2023, restructuring charges included $
10
 million in non-cash impairment charges related to the operating lease right-of-use assets and related property and equipment of certain of our leased and company-owned facilities as discussed further in Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, $
2
 million of professional fees and $
3
 million of severance costs. The impairment charges were the result of our decision to exit the leased and company-owned properties. The severance costs related to our continued review and optimization of selling, general and administrative expenses.
In 2022, restructuring charges included an $
11
 million impairment charge related to our prior corporate headquarters facility operating lease right-of-use asset and leasehold improvements, a $
2
 million impairment of certain internally developed software, $
1
 million of accelerated depreciation related to the early termination of a lease, and $
6
 million of severance and other costs. Severance costs of $
2
 million related to a reduction in workforce of 
seven
 percent as part of our completed strategic review of selling and administrative expenses.
The pre-tax charges discussed above are included in restructuring charges in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were $
4
 million and less than $1 million, respectively, of accrued restructuring charges on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. During the year ended December 31, 2024, 
less than $
1
 million of the prior year accrued restructuring charges were paid or otherwise settled.

Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies
Accruals for home warranty claims are made using internal actuarial projections, which are based on current claims and historical claims experience. Accruals are established based on estimates of the ultimate cost to settle claims. Home warranty claims take approximately 
three months
 to settle, on average, and substantially all claims are settled within 
six months
 of incurrence. The amount of time required to settle a claim can vary based on a number of factors, including whether a replacement is ultimately required. In addition to our estimates, we engage a third-party actuary to perform an accrual analysis utilizing generally accepted actuarial methods that incorporate cumulative historical claims experience and information provided by us. We regularly review our estimates of claims costs along with the third-party analysis and adjust our estimates when appropriate. We believe that utilizing actuarial methods in our estimation process to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these judgmental accruals.

64

Unpaid losses and loss adjustment reserves represent the estimated ultimate cost of settling all new home structural warranty claims and includes the estimated costs of claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. The reserve is based upon the facts of each case and the Company’s experience with similar cases. The establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain and complex process. Reserve estimates are primarily derived using an actuarial estimation process in which historical loss patterns are applied to actual paid losses and reported losses (paid losses plus individual case reserves established by claim adjusters) to create an estimate of how losses are likely to develop over time. We regularly review our estimates of unpaid losses and adjust our estimates when appropriate. The Company reports its unpaid losses and loss adjustment reserves gross of the amounts related to unpaid losses recoverable from reinsurers and net of amounts ceded to reinsurers.
We have certain liabilities with respect to existing or potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings. We accrue for these liabilities when it is probable that future costs will be incurred and such costs can be reasonably estimated. Any resulting adjustments, which could be material, are recorded in the period the adjustments are identified.
Due to the nature of our business activities, we are also at times subject to pending and threatened legal and regulatory actions that arise out of the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, based in part upon advice of legal counsel, the disposition of any such matters is not expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, the results of legal actions cannot be predicted with certainty. Therefore, it is possible that our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected in any particular period by the unfavorable resolution of one or more legal actions.

Note 10. Stock-Based Compensation
The Omnibus Plan permits the grant to certain employees, consultants and non-employee directors of Frontdoor different forms of awards, including non-qualified stock options, performance options, RSUs, performance shares, RSAs and deferred share equivalents. Upon adoption, 
14,500,000
 shares were reserved for grants under the Omnibus Plan. Our compensation committee determines the long-term incentive mix of awards to our employees and may authorize new grants annually. As of December 31, 2024, 
8,761,706
 shares remain available for future grants.
Stock Options
Stock options are exercisable based on the terms outlined in the applicable award agreement and have generally vested over a period of 
four years
. 
The grant date fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the assumptions noted in the following table. A historical daily measurement of volatility is determined based on our and our peer companies’ average volatility. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the outstanding U.S. Treasury note with a term equal to the expected life of the option granted. The expected life represents the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding and was calculated using the simplified approach due to our lack of historical experience upon which to estimate the expected lives of the options.

Performance Options
Performance options are exercisable based on the terms outlined in the applicable award agreement. The grant date fair value of performance options is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model. In addition to service conditions, the ultimate number of performance options to be earned depends on the achievement of a market condition prior to the fourth anniversary of the grant date, which is based on a share price target. Performance options granted during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 have a weighted-average service period of approximately 
0.8
 years and 
1.6
 years, respectively, from the initial grant date.
During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 we granted options to purchase 
652,004
 and 
272,503
 shares of our common stock, respectively, with a weighted-average exercise price of $
26.42
 per share and $
24.74

no
t issue any performance options under the Omnibus Plan during the 
year ended December 31, 2024. The weighted-average grant date fair values of the performance options granted during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $
10.40
 per share and $
11.50
 per share, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we applied a forfeiture assumption of 
15
 percent per annum in the recognition of the expense related to these performance options, with the exception of the options held by our CEO for which we applied a forfeiture rate of 
zero
 percent. The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $
3

ESPP
On March 21, 2019, our board of directors approved and recommended for approval by our stockholders the ESPP, which was approved by our stockholders on April 29, 2019 and became effective for offering periods commencing July 1, 2019. The ESPP is intended to qualify for favorable tax treatment under Section 423 of the Code. Under the plan, eligible employees may purchase common stock, subject to IRS limits, during pre-specified offering periods at a discount established by Frontdoor not to exceed 
15
 percent of the then current fair market value. A maximum of 
1,250,000
 shares of our common stock are authorized for sale under the plan. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we issued 
26,425
 shares, 
31,288
 shares and 
53,353
 shares, respectively, under the ESPP. There were 
1,048,057
 shares available for issuance under the ESPP as of December 31, 2024.
Stock-based compensation expense
We recognized stock-based compensation expense of $
26
 million ($
20
 million, net of tax), $
26
 million ($
22
 million, net of tax) and $
22
 million ($
19
 million, net of tax) for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These charges are included in selling and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.

67

Stock-based compensation expense for stock options, RSUs and RSAs is recognized over the vesting period of the award using a straight-line vesting method, net of estimated forfeitures. In addition, for performance shares with a performance condition, we evaluate the probability of achieving the performance condition at the end of each reporting period and record the related stock-based compensation expense over the service period. For performance shares and performance options with a market condition, the related stock-based compensation expense is recognized regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied, provided that the requisite service has been provided.
As of December 31, 2024, there was $
35
 million of total unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to unvested stock options, performance options, RSUs, performance shares and RSAs. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 
2.06
 years.

Note 11. Employee Benefit Plans
We currently maintain a defined contribution plan for the benefit of our employees, the Frontdoor, Inc. 401(k) Plan. Discretionary contributions made on behalf of our employees were $
5
 million, $
4
 million and $
4
 million for the 
years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These charges are included in selling and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.

Credit Facilities
On June 17, 2021, we entered into the Credit Agreement, which provided for a $
260
 million Prior Term Loan A maturing 
June 17, 2026
, a $
380
 million Prior Term Loan B maturing 
June 17, 2028
 and a $
250
 million Prior Revolving Credit Facility terminating 
June 17, 2026
.

On March 8, 2023, in connection with the planned phase-out of LIBOR, we entered into the first amendment to the Credit Agreement for the purpose of replacing LIBOR with SOFR as the benchmark rate under the Credit Agreement. This change was effective in March 2023 for the Prior Term Loan A and the Prior Revolving Credit Facility and effective in June 2023 for the Prior Term Loan B.
On December 19, 2024, we entered into the second amendment to the Credit Agreement, which provides for a $
418
 million Term Loan A maturing 
December 19, 2029
, an $
800
 million Term Loan B maturing 
December 19, 2031
 and a $
250
 million Revolving Credit Facility terminating 
December 19, 2029
. The net proceeds from the transaction were used to repay the Prior Term Loan Facilities, including accrued and unpaid interest, to fund the 2-10 HBW Acquisition, which also closed on December 19, 2024, and to pay related fees and expenses of all these transactions with the remainder designated to fund share repurchases or for other general corporate purposes.

68

In connection with the second amendment to the Credit Agreement, we repaid all of the then current outstanding principal amounts of the Prior Term Loan Facilities, consisting of $
218
 million related to the Prior Term Loan A and $
368
 million related to the Prior Term Loan B, and recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $
3
 million, which included the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount. Additionally, on December 19, 2024
, we amended and restated the Revolving Credit Facility, which carried, and continues to carry, a $
2
 million balance.
We are required to make quarterly installment payments on Term Loan A equal to 
five
 percent per annum of the original principal amount commencing on the last day of each quarter beginning on March 31, 2025. The interest rates applicable to Term Loan A and the Revolving Credit Facility are based on a fluctuating rate of interest based on the Consolidated First Lien Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) and measured by reference to either, at our option, (i) an adjusted SOFR plus a margin range of 
1.50
 percent to 
2.00
 percent
 per annum or (ii) an alternate base rate plus a margin range of 
0.50
 percent to 
1.00
 percent
 per annum.

We are required to make quarterly installment payments on Term Loan B equal to 
one
 percent per annum of the original principal amount commencing on the last day of each quarter beginning on 
March 31, 2025. The interest rates applicable to Term Loan B are based on a fluctuating rate of interest measured by reference to either, at our option, (i) an adjusted SOFR plus a margin of 
2.25
 percent per annum or (ii) an alternate base rate plus a margin of 
1.25
 percent per annum.
The obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain subsidiaries (collectively, the “Guarantors”) and are secured by substantially all of the material tangible and intangible assets of Frontdoor and the Guarantors, subject to certain customary exceptions.
The terms of the Revolving Credit Facility entered into on December 19, 2024 are substantially the same as the terms of the Prior Revolving Credit Facility, except for the extended maturity. The Revolving Credit Facility provides for senior secured revolving loans and stand-by and other letters of credit. As of December 31, 2024
, we had $
2
 million of letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. The letters of credit are posted in lieu of cash to satisfy regulatory requirements in certain states in which we operate. The Credit Agreement contains covenants that limit or restrict our ability, including the ability of certain of our subsidiaries, to incur additional indebtedness, repurchase debt, incur liens, sell assets, make certain payments (including dividends) and enter into transactions with affiliates; therefore, from time to time, our ability to draw on the Revolving Credit Facility may be limited. As of December 31, 2024, the available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility was $
248
 million.

As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants under the Credit Agreement.
Interest Rate Swaps
On October 24, 2018, we entered into an interest rate swap contract effective October 31, 2018 that expires on August 16, 2025. The notional amount of the agreement is $
350
 million. Under the terms of the agreement, we will pay a fixed rate of interest of 
3.028
 percent on the notional amount, and we will receive a floating rate of interest (based on SOFR, subject to a floor of 
zero
 percent) on the notional amount. As a result, through August 16, 2025, $
350
 million of the Amended Term Loan Facilities is fixed at a rate of 
3.028
 percent, plus the incremental borrowing margin of 
2.25
 percent.
In connection with the Amended Credit Facility, we entered into an additional interest rate swap contract effective December 19, 2024 that expires on December 31, 2029. The initial notional amount of the agreement is $
299
 million with additional step up and step down provisions embedded in the contract. The notional amount steps up in August 2025 by $
350
 million upon the expiration of the company's other interest rate swap contract. The notional amount steps down over the term of the agreement on a basis that correlates with the scheduled principal payments on the Amended Term Loan Facilities. Under the terms of the agreement, we will pay a fixed rate of interest of 
4.140
 percent on the notional amount, and we will receive a floating rate of interest (based on SOFR, subject to a floor of 
zero
 percent) on the notional amount. As a result, a portion of the outstanding principal balance on the Amended Term Loan Facilities in an amount that correlates with the then current notional amount of this interest rate swap contract is fixed at a rate of 
4.140
 percent, plus the incremental borrowing margin of 
2.25
 percent.

Gains and losses on sales of investments, as determined on a specific identification basis, are included in investment income in the period they are realized. We periodically review our portfolio of investments to determine whether there has been an other than temporary decline in the value of the investments from factors such as deterioration in the financial condition of the issuer or the market(s) in which the issuer competes. There were no proceeds, maturities, gross realized gains and gross realized losses resulting from sales of available-for-sale securities. There were 
no
 impairment charges due to other than temporary declines in the value of certain investments for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.

Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

Note 17. Derivative Financial Instruments
We currently use a derivative financial instrument to manage risks associated with changes in interest rates by hedging the interest payments on a portion of our variable rate debt through the use of interest rate swap contracts. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. In designating derivative financial instruments as hedging instruments under accounting standards for derivative instruments, we formally document the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, as well as the risk management objective and strategy for the use of the hedging instrument. This documentation includes linking the derivatives to forecasted transactions. We assess at the time a derivative contract is entered into, and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the derivative item is effective in offsetting the projected cash flows of the associated forecasted transaction.
Our interest rate swap contracts are classified as cash flow hedges, and, as such, are recorded in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position on an individual basis as either an asset or liability at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in AOCI. Cash flows related to the interest rate swap contracts are classified as operating activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows.

72

The effective portion of the gain or loss on our interest rate swap contracts are recorded in AOCI. These amounts are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted debt interest settlement affects earnings. See Note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the effective portion of the gain or loss on derivative instruments recorded in AOCI and for the amounts reclassified out of AOCI and into earnings during the periods presented. As the underlying forecasted transactions occur during the next 12 months, we estimate the unrealized hedging gain in AOCI expected to be recognized in earnings is $
2
 million, net of tax, as of December 31, 2024. The amounts ultimately reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months will be determined based on the actual interest rates in effect at the time the positions are settled, and as a result, they could differ materially from our estimate noted above.

Note 18. Fair Value Measurements
We estimate fair value at a price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal market for the asset or liability. The valuation techniques require inputs that we categorize into a three-level hierarchy, from highest to lowest level of observable inputs, as follows: unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets ("Level 1"); direct or indirect observable inputs, including quoted prices or other market data, for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or identical assets or liabilities in less active markets ("Level 2"); and unobservable inputs that require significant judgment for which there is little or no market data ("Level 3"). When multiple input levels are required for a valuation, we categorize the entire fair value measurement according to the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement, even though we may have also utilized significant inputs that are more readily observable.
The period-end carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to the short-term maturities of these financial instruments. The period-end carrying amounts of short- and long-term marketable securities also approximate fair value and primarily consists of available-for-sale debt securities. Unrealized gains and losses are reported net of tax as a component of AOCI in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position. Any unrealized losses where the decline in value is other than temporary are reported in interest and net investment income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. There were no other than temporary declines in value for the periods ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the carrying amounts of our total debt were $
1,199
 million and $
593
 million, respectively, and the estimated fair values were $
1,211
 million and $
598
 million, respectively. The fair value of our debt was estimated based on available market prices for the same or similar instruments that are considered significant other observable inputs (Level 2) within the fair value hierarchy and was based on information available to us as of the respective period end dates.
We determine the fair value of our interest rate swap contracts using a forward interest rate curve obtained from a third-party market data provider. The fair value of each contract is the sum of the expected future settlements between the contract counterparties, discounted to present value. The expected future settlements are determined by comparing the contract interest rates to the expected forward interest rate as of each settlement date and applying the difference between these two rates to the notional amounts of debt in the interest rate swap contracts.
We did not change our valuation techniques for measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2024. Transfers between hierarchy levels, if any, are recognized at the end of the reporting period. There were 
no
 transfers between hierarchy levels during the year ended December 31, 2024.

 shares of common stock outstanding. We have no other classes of equity securities issued or outstanding.

Note 20. Share Repurchase Program
On July 26, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of up to $
650
 million of our common stock over the 
three-year
 period from September 4, 2024 through September 4, 2027. Purchases under this new repurchase program may be made from time to time by the company in the open market at prevailing market prices (including through a Rule 10b5-1 Plan), in privately negotiated transactions, or through any combination of these methods, through September 4, 2027. The actual timing, number, manner and value of any shares repurchased will depend on several factors, including the market price of the company’s stock, general market and economic conditions, the company’s liquidity requirements, applicable legal requirements and other business considerations. The repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any number of shares in any specific period or at all and may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion. As of December 31, 2024
, we repurchased a total of 
709,077
 outstanding shares at an aggregate cost of $
41
 million under this program, which is included in treasury stock on the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position.
On September 3, 2024, our previous repurchase authorization of up to $
400
 million expired. We repurchased a total of 
11,319,091
 outstanding shares at an aggregate cost of $
400
 million under this previous program, which is included in treasury stock on the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position.

Note 21. Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, increased to include the number of shares of common stock that would have been outstanding had potentially dilutive shares of common stock been issued. The dilutive effect of stock options, performance options, RSUs, performance shares and RSAs are reflected in diluted earnings per share by applying the treasury stock method.

A summary of the calculations of our basic and diluted earnings per share is as follows:

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Frontdoor, Inc.

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Frontdoor, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 27, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

 As described in the Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at 2-10 Holdco, Inc., which was acquired on December 19, 2024, and whose financial statements constitute 45% of total assets and 0.3% of total revenue of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting for the acquired business.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND 
DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

None.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In accordance with Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Consistent with guidance issued by the SEC that an assessment of internal controls over financial reporting of a recently acquired business may be omitted from management’s evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures, management is excluding an assessment of such internal controls of 2-10 HBW from its evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. We acquired 2-10 HBW on December 19, 2024. 2-10 HBW represented approximately 45% of our consolidated total assets and 0.3% of our consolidated total revenues as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financials reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

Management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. Management based its assessment on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Consistent with guidance issued by the SEC that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from management's report on internal control over financial reporting in the year of acquisition, management excluded an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting related to 2-10 HBW as described above. Based on this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.

Our independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has audited the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 and has expressed an unqualified opinion in their report which is included herein.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
