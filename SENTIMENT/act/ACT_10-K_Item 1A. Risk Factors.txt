Risk Factors.” We are not undertaking any obligation to update any forward-looking statements or other statements we may make in the following discussion or elsewhere in this document even though these statements may be affected by events or circumstances occurring after the forward-looking statements or other statements were made. Future results could differ significantly from the historical results presented in this section.

Overview of Business
We are a leading private mortgage insurance company, having served the United States housing finance market since 1981, and operate in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Our mortgage insurance products provide credit protection to mortgage lenders, covering a portion of the unpaid principal balance of Low Down Payment Loans in the event of a default. Our business objective is to leverage our competitive strengths to drive market share, maintain our strong capitalization and strong earnings profile and deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders. We also offer mortgage-related insurance and reinsurance through our wholly owned Bermuda-based subsidiary, Enact Re.
We primarily generate revenues by providing mortgage credit protection to our customers in exchange for premiums, which we set based on our evaluation of the underlying risk we insure. Once the premium rate is established and coverage is activated, the premium rate remains unchanged for the first ten years of the policy; thereafter the premium rate resets to a lower rate used for the remaining life of the policy. In general, we can only cancel coverage for a failure to pay premiums or at servicer direction when the borrowers achieve the required amount of home equity. Our premium rate is applied predominantly to the original loan balance to determine either a monthly payment that the lender adds to the borrower’s monthly loan payment or a single upfront payment made by either the borrower or lender at loan closing. The amount of premiums earned from our insurance portfolio and the timing of premium recognition are also affected by persistency rate, which we measure as the percentage of loans that remain on our books based on the annualized cancellations for the period. 
We also employ a CRT program to transfer a portion of our risk through traditional XOL and quota share reinsurance arrangements and the issuance of ILNs. In exchange, we cede a negotiated amount of our premiums to the reinsurers and ILN investors that participate in our CRT transactions. Our net premiums earned (i.e., materially, the gross premiums charged less premiums ceded as part of our CRT program) represent the largest source of our revenues. Importantly, our CRT program helps to manage risk in our operating model and spread the risk of loss across our counterparties while also providing capital relief. 
We also invest our premiums in high quality, predominantly fixed income assets with the primary business objectives of preserving capital, generating investment income and maintaining sufficient liquidity to cover our operating expenses and pay future claims. The investment income generated through our investment portfolio is another significant source of our revenues. 
We generate profits through collection of premiums and investment income less losses, operating expenses, interest expense and taxes. Our mortgage insurance coverage protects lenders against loss in the event of a borrower default by covering a portion of the outstanding principal balance of a loan. In the event of a borrower default, our coverage reduces and, in certain instances eliminates, losses to the insured by transferring the covered portion of the economic loss to us. Borrower defaults are first reported 
62
to us as new delinquencies when the borrower fails to make two consecutive monthly mortgage payments. Incurred losses are our estimate of future claims on these new delinquencies as well as any change in the prior estimates for previously existing delinquencies. In addition, incurred losses include estimates of future claims on IBNR delinquencies. Our incurred losses are based on estimates of both the rate at which delinquencies will go to claim (i.e., claim rate) and the ultimate claim amount (i.e., claim severity). Claim frequency and severity estimates are established based on historical experience focusing on certain delinquency and loan attributes that influence the probability and amount of ultimate claim. Our estimates of ultimate claim amounts for each delinquency include loss adjustment expense (“LAE”) that are costs incurred in the settlement of the claim process such as legal fees and costs to record, process and adjust claims. Incurred losses are generally affected by macroeconomic conditions, borrower credit quality, certain loan attributes, underwriting quality and our loss mitigation efforts among other factors detailed below.
Key Factors Affecting Our Results 
Our financial position and results of operations depend to a significant extent on the following factors, as noted below in “—Trends and Conditions.” 
Mortgage Origination Volume 
The level of mortgage origination volume is a key driver of our future revenues. The overall mortgage origination market is influenced by macroeconomic factors such as the rate of economic growth, the unemployment rate, interest rates, home affordability, household savings rates, the inventory of unsold homes, demographics of potential homebuyers and credit availability. The mortgage origination market is also influenced by various legislative and regulatory actions and GSE programs and policies that impact the housing and mortgage finance industries. 
Penetration
The penetration rate of private mortgage insurance is mainly influenced by the competitiveness of private mortgage insurance compared to alternative products for Low Down Payment Loans provided by government agencies (principally the FHA and the VA), portfolio lenders that self-insure, reinsurers and capital market transactions designed to mitigate risk. In addition, the private mortgage insurance industry’s penetration rate is driven by the relative percentage of purchase mortgage originations versus refinances. Private mortgage insurance penetration tends to be significantly higher on new mortgages for purchased homes than on the refinance of existing mortgages, because average LTV ratios are typically higher on home purchases and therefore are more likely to require mortgage insurance. Lastly, we believe the penetration rate of private mortgage insurance is influenced by other factors, including lender preference, FHA competitiveness and risk appetite, loan limits, contractual terms including cancellability and loss mitigation practices. 
Credit and Regulatory Environment 
The level of private mortgage insurance market penetration and eventual market size is affected in part by actions taken by the GSEs and the United States government, including the FHA, the FHFA and Congress, that impact housing or housing finance policy. In the past, these actions have included announced changes, or potential changes, to underwriting standards, FHA pricing, GSE guaranty fees and loan limits, as well as low down payment programs available through the FHA or GSEs. 
Competition and Market Share 
Competitors include other private mortgage insurers that are eligible to write business for the GSEs. We compete with other private mortgage insurers based on pricing, underwriting guidelines, customer relationships, service levels, policy terms, loss mitigation practices, perceived financial strength (including comparative credit ratings), reputation, strength of management, product features and technology ease-
63
of-use. We also compete with governmental agencies (principally the FHA and the VA) primarily based on price and underwriting guidelines. 
Pricing is highly competitive in the mortgage insurance industry, with industry participants competing for market share, customer relationships and overall value. Pricing trends have introduced an increasing number of loan, borrower, lender and property attributes, resulting in expanded granularity in pricing regimes in order to better align price and risk. Our proprietary risk-based pricing engine evaluates returns and volatility under both the PMIERs capital framework and our internal economic capital framework, which is sensitive to economic cycles and current housing market conditions. The model assesses the performance of new business under expected and stress scenarios on an individualized loan basis, which is used to determine pricing and inform our risk selection strategy that optimizes economic value by balancing return and volatility.
Seasonality
Consistent with the seasonality of home sales, purchase mortgage origination volumes typically increase in late spring and peak during summer months, leading to a rise in NIW volume during the second and third quarters of a given year. Refinancing volume, however, does not follow a similar seasonal trend and instead is primarily influenced by interest rates, which can overwhelm typical seasonal trends. Delinquency performance (new delinquency formation and cure behavior) is generally favorable in the first and second quarters of the year. Therefore, we typically experience lower levels of losses resulting from favorable delinquency activity in the first and second quarters, as compared to the third and fourth quarters. 
The following table presents our NIW, number of cures and new delinquencies for primary policies, excluding our run-off insurance block with reference properties in Mexico, for the periods indicated:

NIW
NIW occurs when a lender activates mortgage insurance coverage on a closed mortgage loan. NIW increases our IIF, premiums written and premiums earned. NIW is affected by the overall size of the mortgage origination market, the penetration rate of private mortgage insurance into the overall mortgage origination market and our market share of the private mortgage insurance market. 
Pricing 
Our pricing strategy is designed to charge premium rates commensurate with the underlying risk of each loan we insure. Our proprietary platform provides us with a more flexible, granular and analytical approach to selecting and pricing risk. Using our platform, we can quickly change price to modify our risk selection levels, respond to industry pricing trends or adjust to changing economic conditions. We believe that our platform, powered by our proprietary risk model and our understanding of mortgage risk volatility, provides us with a highly sophisticated pricing regime that improves our risk selection and is designed to yield attractive risk adjusted returns through credit cycles. 
64
IIF
IIF at the time of origination is used to determine premiums as the premium rate is expressed as a percentage of IIF. IIF is one of the primary drivers of our future earned premium. Based on the composition of our insurance portfolio, with monthly premium policies comprising a larger proportion of our total portfolio than single premium policies, an increase or decrease in IIF generally has a corresponding impact on premiums earned. Cancellations of our insurance policies as a result of prepayments and other reductions of IIF, such as rescissions of coverage and claims paid, generally have a negative effect on premiums earned. 
Persistency Rate and Business Mix
The percentage of our IIF that remains insured after taking into account annualized cancellations for the period presented is defined as our persistency rate. Because our insurance premiums are earned over the life of a policy, higher or lower persistency rates can have a significant impact on our profitability. Recent elevated interest rates have increased persistency in the portfolio, but this impact is partially offset by lower NIW. 
Loan prepayment speeds and the relative mix of business between single premium policies and monthly premium policies also impact our profitability. Assuming all other factors remain constant over the life of the policies, prepayment speeds have an inverse impact on IIF and the expected premium from our monthly policies. Slower prepayment speeds, demonstrated by a higher persistency rate, result in IIF remaining in place, providing increased premium from monthly policies over time as premium payments continue. Earlier than anticipated prepayments, demonstrated by a lower persistency rate, reduce IIF and the premium from our monthly policies. 
The following table presents the weighted average mortgage interest rate on outstanding primary IIF as of December 31, 2024, excluding our run-off business. Prepayment speeds may be affected by changes in interest rates, among other factors. An increasing interest rate environment generally will reduce refinancing activity and result in lower prepayments. A declining interest rate environment generally will increase refinancing activity and increase prepayments.

Average Annual Mortgage Interest Rate weighted by IIF.
In contrast to monthly premium policies, when single premium policies are cancelled by the insured because the loan has been paid off or otherwise, any remaining unearned premiums are earned at cancellation. Although these cancellations reduce IIF, assuming all other factors remain constant, the profitability of our single premium business increases when persistency rates are lower. Our concentration of single premium policies has declined in recent years, as a result of elevated interest 
65
rates. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, single premium policies comprised 9% and 10% of primary IIF, respectively. 
Credit Quality
Improved analytics, stronger loan origination quality controls and the regulatory developments have resulted in a significant improvement in the credit quality for loans originated in the private mortgage insurance market over time. Additionally, private mortgage insurers and the GSEs have maintained strong credit standards over the past decade, with average FICO scores for NIW persisting at levels significantly above historical averages. As a result, the industry is insuring loans from borrowers who should be better positioned to meet their mortgage obligations. 
Net Investment Income
Net investment income is determined primarily by the invested assets held and the average yield on our overall investment portfolio.
Net Investment Gains (Losses)
The recognition of realized investment gains or losses can vary significantly across periods as the activity is highly discretionary based on such factors as market opportunities, our capital profile and overall market cycles that impact the timing of selling securities. 
Losses Incurred
Losses incurred represent current payments and changes in the estimated future payments on claims that result from delinquent loans. We estimate an expense only for delinquent loans as explained in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. Incurred losses depend to a significant extent on the following factors: 
•
deterioration of regional or national economic conditions leading to a reduction in borrowers’ income and thus their ability to make mortgage payments; 
•
legislative, regulatory, FHFA or GSE action, or executive orders permitting or mandating forbearance or a moratorium on foreclosures or evictions due to events such as natural disasters or a pandemic (e.g. COVID-19); 
•
a drop in housing values that could expose us to greater loss on resale of properties obtained through foreclosure proceedings and an adverse change in the effectiveness of loss mitigation actions that could result in an increase in the frequency of expected claim rates; 
•
a drop in housing values that negatively impacts a borrower’s willingness to continue mortgage payments, potentially leading to higher delinquencies and ultimately claims; 
•
if the foreclosure occurs in a state that imposes judicial process, which generally increases the amount of time it takes for a foreclosure to be completed, which impacts severity of the claim; 
•
the credit characteristics in our in-force portfolio, as loans with higher risk characteristics generally result in more delinquencies and claims; 
•
the size of loans we insure, as loans with relatively higher average loan amounts generally result in higher incurred losses; 
•
the coverage percentage on insured loans, as loans with higher percentages of insurance coverage generally correlate with higher incurred losses; 
•
the level and amount of reinsurance coverage maintained with third parties; and 
66
•
the distribution of claims over the life of a book. Historically, the first few years after origination have relatively low claims, with claims increasing for several years subsequently and then declining. However, persistency, the condition of the economy, including unemployment and housing prices and other factors can affect this pattern. 
Credit Risk Transfer 
We use CRT transactions to transfer a portion of our risk to third parties, through traditional XOL and quota share reinsurance and the issuance of ILNs. Our CRT program reduces the volatility of our in-force portfolio and provides capital relief under PMIERs. When we enter into a CRT transaction, the reinsurer receives a premium and, in exchange, insures an agreed upon portion of incurred losses. These arrangements have the impact of reducing our earned premiums and incurred losses, but also provide capital relief under PMIERs.  
Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses include costs related to the acquisition and ongoing maintenance of our insurance contracts, including sales, underwriting and general operating costs. Acquisition expenses are influenced by the amount of our NIW. Acquisition costs that are related directly to the successful acquisition of new insurance policies, such as underwriting expenses, are deferred and amortized over the life of the underlying insurance policies. These deferred acquisition costs are referred to as “DAC.” The ongoing maintenance expenses of our insurance contracts are generally fixed in nature and include costs such as information technology, finance and legal, among others, including costs allocated from Genworth for certain activities on our behalf. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements regarding our related party transactions. 
Critical Accounting Estimates
The accounting estimates (including sensitivities) discussed in this section are those that we consider to be particularly critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our ability to judge the effect of inherently uncertain matters on our financial results. The sensitivities included in this section involve matters that are also inherently uncertain and involve the exercise of significant judgment in selecting the factors and amounts used in the sensitivities. Small changes in the amounts used in the sensitivities or the use of different factors could result in materially different outcomes from those reflected in the sensitivities. For all of these accounting estimates, we caution that future events seldom develop as estimated and management’s best estimates often require adjustment. 
Loss Reserves
Loss reserves represent the amount needed to provide for the estimated ultimate cost of settling claims relating to insured events that have occurred on or before the end of the respective reporting period. The estimated liability includes requirements for future payments of: (a) losses that have been reported to the insurer; (b) losses related to insured events that have occurred but that have not been reported to the insurer as of the date the liability is estimated; and (c) LAE. Loss adjustment expenses include costs incurred in the claim settlement process such as legal fees and costs to record, process and adjust claims. Consistent with U.S. GAAP and industry accounting practices, we do not establish loss reserves for future claims on insured loans that are not in default or believed to be in default. 
Estimates and actuarial assumptions used for establishing loss reserves involve the exercise of significant judgment, and changes in assumptions or deviations of actual experience from assumptions can have material impacts on our loss reserves and net income (loss). Because these assumptions relate to factors that are not known in advance, change over time, are difficult to accurately predict and are inherently uncertain, we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts we will pay for actual claims or the timing of those payments. The sources of uncertainty affecting the estimates are numerous and include factors internal and external to us. Internal factors include, but are not limited to, changes in 
67
the mix of exposures, loss mitigation activities and claim settlement practices. Significant external influences include changes in home prices, unemployment, government housing policies, state foreclosure timeline, general economic conditions, interest rates, tax policy, credit availability and mortgage products. Small changes in assumptions or small deviations of actual experience from assumptions can have, and in the past have had, material impacts on our reserves, results of operations and financial condition. 
We establish reserves to recognize the estimated liability for losses and LAE related to defaults on insured mortgage loans. Loss reserves are established by estimating the number of loans in our inventory of delinquent loans that will result in a claim payment, which is referred to as the claim rate, and further estimating the amount of the claim payment, which is referred to as claim severity. The estimates are determined using a factor-based approach, in which assumptions of claim rates for loans in default and the average amount paid for loans that result in a claim are calculated using traditional actuarial techniques. Over time, as the status of the underlying delinquent loans moves toward foreclosure and the likelihood of the associated claim loss increases, the amount of the loss reserves associated with the potential claims may also increase. 
Management monitors actual experience, and where circumstances warrant, will revise its assumptions. Our liability for loss reserves is reviewed regularly, with changes in our estimates of future claims recorded through net income. Estimation of losses is based on historical claim and cure experience and covered exposures and is inherently judgmental. Future developments may result in losses greater or less than the liability for loss reserves provided.  
Loss reserves as of December 31, 2024, were $525 million, an increase of $7 million since December 31, 2023. In considering the potential sensitivity of the factors underlying management’s best estimate of our loss reserve, it is possible that even a relatively small change in the estimated claim and severity rates could have a significant impact on loss reserves and, correspondingly, on results of operations. For example, based on our actual experience during the three-year period immediately preceding December 31, 2024, a change of 4 percentage points, or 15%, in the average claim rate would change the gross loss reserve amount for such quarter by approximately $72 million. Likewise, a change of 3 percentage points, or a change of 3%, in the average severity rate would change the gross loss reserve amount for such quarter by approximately $15 million. 
Investments
Valuation of Fixed Maturity Securities 
Our portfolio of fixed maturity securities was valued at $5,625 million as of December 31, 2024, an increase of $359 million from December 31, 2023.
The methodologies, estimates and assumptions used in valuing our fixed maturity securities evolve over time and are subject to different interpretations, all of which can lead to materially different estimates of fair value. Additionally, because the valuation is based on market conditions at a specific point in time, the period-to-period changes in fair value may vary significantly due to changing interest rates, external macroeconomic and credit market conditions. For example, widening credit spreads will generally result in a decrease, while tightening of credit spreads will generally result in an increase in the fair value of our fixed maturity securities. Also, during periods of increasing interest rates, the market values of lower-yielding assets will decline. See “Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” for the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates on our investments portfolio.
Our portfolio of fixed maturity securities comprises primarily investment grade securities, which are carried at fair value. Estimates of fair values for fixed maturity securities are obtained primarily from industry-standard pricing methodologies utilizing market observable inputs. For our less liquid securities, such as our privately placed securities, we utilize independent market data to employ alternative valuation methods commonly used in the financial services industry to estimate fair value. Based on the market observability of the inputs used in estimating the fair value, the pricing level is assigned.
68
See Notes 2, 3 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the valuation of fixed maturity securities and a description of the fair value measurement estimates and level assignments. 
Allowance for Credit Losses on Available-For-Sale Securities 
As of each balance sheet date, we evaluate fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position for changes to the allowance for credit losses. Determining the value of the unrealized losses is dependent on the same methodologies and assumptions used in our valuation of fixed maturity securities. We also consider all available information relevant to the collectability of the security, including information about past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts, when developing the estimate of cash flows expected to be collected. There is no recorded allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2024.
See Notes 2 and 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the allowance for credit losses on fixed maturity securities. 
Revenue Recognition
The majority of our insurance contracts have recurring monthly premiums. We recognize recurring premiums over the terms of the related insurance policy on a pro-rata basis. Premiums written on single premium policies and annual premium policies are initially deferred as unearned premium reserve and earned over the policy life. A portion of the revenue from single premium policies is recognized in premiums earned in the current period, and the remaining portion is deferred as unearned premiums and earned over the estimated expiration of risk of the policy. If single premium policies are cancelled and the premium is non-refundable, then the remaining unearned premium related to each cancelled policy is recognized to earned premiums upon notification of the cancellation. For borrower-paid mortgage insurance, coverage ceases at the earlier of prepayment, or when the original principal is amortized to a 78% loan-to-value ratio in accordance with HOPA. Variation in cancellation rates and projected losses are inputs into our premium recognition models, causing uncertainty within our estimates.
We periodically review our premium earnings recognition models with any adjustments to the estimates reflected as a cumulative adjustment on a retrospective basis in current period net income. These reviews include the consideration of recent and projected loss and policy cancellation experience, and adjustments to the estimated earnings patterns are made, if warranted. 
Unearned premiums were $115 million as of December 31, 2024, a decrease of $35 million compared to December 31, 2023. Changes in market conditions could cause a decline in mortgage originations, mortgage insurance penetration rates, persistency and our market share, all of which could impact new insurance written. For example, a decline in primary new insurance written of $1.0 billion would result in a reduction in earned premiums of approximately $4 million in the first full year. Likewise, if primary persistency rates declined on our existing insurance in-force by 10%, earned premiums would decline by approximately $95 million during the first full year, partially offset by higher policy cancellations in our single premium products. These reductions in earned premiums could be potentially offset by lower reserves due to policies no longer being in-force.

Trends and Conditions
Macroeconomic environment.

During 2024, the United States economy continued to show positive signs, but faced lingering uncertainty due to inflationary pressure, the geopolitical environment and other macroeconomic concerns. 
Inflationary pressures moderated in 2024, with the Bureau of Labor Statistics reporting in December that Consumer Price Index inflation was 2.9% year-over-year. The Federal Reserve took an aggressive approach towards addressing inflation with policy rates reaching a cyclical peak in July 2023. The Federal Open Market Committee began to lower policy rates in September 2024 with additional reductions in November and December 2024. Mortgage rates remain elevated but have declined compared to highs in late 2023.
Mortgage origination activity increased modestly in 2024 but remained relatively slow in response to elevated mortgage rates and sustained low housing supply. Over the past few years, housing affordability deteriorated as elevated mortgage rates and home price appreciation outpaced median family income according to the National Association of Realtors Housing Affordability Index. National house prices continued to rise in 2024 according to the Federal Housing Finance Agency (“FHFA”) Monthly Purchase-Only House Price Index.
The unemployment rate was 4.1% as of December 31, 2024, compared to 3.7% in December 2023. As of December 31, 2024, the number of unemployed Americans was approximately 6.9 million and the number of long term unemployed over 26 weeks was approximately 1.6 million. 
Forbearance and loss mitigation programs.
 Borrowers’ ability to utilize extended forbearance timelines permitted through the CARES Act and GSE COVID-19 servicing-related policies ended in 2023. Borrowers that meet general hardship and program guidelines continue to have access to standard forbearance policies as a loss mitigation option. Additionally, in March 2023, the GSEs announced new loss mitigation programs that allow six-month payment deferrals for borrowers facing financial hardship.
Although it is difficult to predict the future level of reported forbearance and how many of the policies in a forbearance plan that remain current on their monthly mortgage payment will go delinquent, servicer-reported forbearances have generally declined. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 1.1%, or 10,943, of our active primary policies were reported in a forbearance plan, of which approximately 34% were reported as delinquent. Approximately 9% of our primary new delinquencies in 2024 were subject to a forbearance plan as compared to 13% in 2023.
Regulatory developments.
 Private mortgage insurance market penetration and eventual market size are affected in part by actions that impact housing or housing finance policy taken by the GSEs and the U.S. government, including but not limited to, the Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”) and the FHFA. In the past, these actions have included announced changes, or potential changes, to underwriting standards, including changes to the GSEs’ automated underwriting systems, FHA pricing, GSE guaranty fees, loan limits and alternative products. 
On October 24, 2022, the FHFA 
announced the validation and approval of both the FICO 10T credit score model and the VantageScore 4.0 credit score model for anticipated use by the GSEs as well as proposing to change the requirement that lenders provide credit reports from all three nationwide consumer reporting agencies and instead only requiring credit reports from two of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies. The validation of the new credit scores is currently expected to require lenders to deliver both credit scores for each loan sold to the GSEs. Implementation, which has been delayed beyond 2025, will require system and process updates along with coordination across stakeholders of the industry. 
On August 21, 2024, the GSEs and the FHFA released updated PMIERs requirements phasing in a revision to the available assets standards between March 31, 2025, and September 30, 2026. The updated standards differentiate between bonds based on credit quality and liquidity. The updates also 
70
establish limits for assets backed by residential mortgages or commercial real estate to mitigate the impact if such assets lose value during periods of housing stress. We expect to hold capital sufficiency well in excess of these requirements and do not expect the impact of these updates to be material to our sufficiency. The ultimate impact of the PMIERs changes will be influenced by investment portfolio maturities, dispositions, reinvestments, and overall business and economic performance between today and the phase-in dates.
Competitive environment.
 The U.S. private mortgage insurance industry is highly competitive. Our market share is influenced by the execution of our go to market strategy, including but not limited to, pricing competitiveness relative to our peers and our selective participation in forward commitment transactions. We continue to manage the quality of new business through pricing and our underwriting guidelines, which are modified from time to time when circumstances warrant. We see the market and underwriting conditions, including the pricing environment, as being within our risk-adjusted return appetite enabling us to write new business at attractive returns. Ultimately, we expect our new insurance written with its strong credit profile and attractive pricing to positively contribute to our future profitability and return on equity.
Our portfolio.
 New insurance written of $51.0 billion in 2024 decreased 4% compared to 2023. Changes in NIW are primarily impacted by the size of the mortgage insurance market and our market share. Our primary persistency rate decreased to 83% during 2024 compared to 85% during 2023. Persistency remains elevated due to high interest rates but decreased in 2024 due to rate volatility throughout the year. Elevated persistency has continued to offset the decline in new insurance written, leading to an increase in primary insurance in-force of $5.9 billion or 2% since December 31, 2023. 
Net earned premiums increased $23 million in 2024 compared to 2023 as a result of higher average IIF and higher assumed premiums, consisting primarily of Enact Re’s GSE credit risk transfer participation and multifamily reinsurance. This was partially offset by higher ceded premium. 
Our largest customer accounted for 11% and 10% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This customer also accounted for 20%, 19% and 18% of our total NIW during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  No other customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenues or NIW for the years ended December 31, 2024 or 2023. No customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues and no other customer accounted for more than 10% of NIW for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Loss experience.
 Our loss ratio for the year ended December 31, 2024, was 4% as compared to 3% for the year ended December 31, 2023. Both periods were impacted by favorable reserve adjustments. In 2024, we recorded a reserve release of $252 million, primarily on prior accident year reserves as a result of strong cure performance and loss mitigation efforts. As part of the 2024 reserve adjustments, we decreased our claim rate assumptions for new and existing delinquencies as a result of sustained favorable cure performance and lessening uncertainty in the economic environment, which impacted reserves from current and prior accident years. During 2023, we released reserves of $241 million primarily due to better than expected cure experience on delinquencies from 2022 and earlier, including a portion of those related to the emergence of COVID-19.
The severity of loss on loans that go to claim may be negatively impacted by the extended forbearance and foreclosure timelines, the associated elevated expenses and the higher loan amount of the recent new delinquencies. These negative influences on loss severity could be mitigated, in part, by embedded home price appreciation. For loans insured on or after October 1, 2014, our mortgage insurance policies limit the number of months of unpaid interest and associated expenses that are included in the mortgage insurance claim amount to a maximum of 36 months.
New delinquencies in 2024 increased compared to 2023 primarily due to the aging of large, newer books of business. Current period primary delinquencies of 48,537 contributed $287 million of loss expense in 2024. We incurred $265 million of losses from 41,617 current period delinquencies in 2023. In 
71
determining the loss expense estimate, considerations were given to recent cure and claim experience and the prevailing and prospective economic conditions.  
Capital requirements and ratings.
 EMICO’s risk-to-capital ratio under the current regulatory framework as established under North Carolina law and enforced by the NCDOI, EMICO’s domestic insurance regulator, was approximately 10.5:1 as of December 31, 2024, and 11.6:1 as of December 31, 2023. EMICO’s risk-to-capital ratio remains below the NCDOI’s maximum risk-to-capital ratio of 25:1. North Carolina’s calculation of risk-to-capital excludes the risk-in-force for delinquent loans given the established loss reserves against all delinquencies. EMICO’s ongoing risk-to-capital ratio will depend principally on the magnitude of future losses incurred by EMICO, the effectiveness of ongoing loss mitigation activities, new business volume and profitability, the impact of quota share reinsurance, the amount of policy lapses and the amount of additional capital that is generated or distributed by the business.
As of December 31, 2024, we had estimated available assets of $5,095 million against $3,043 million net required assets under PMIERs compared to available assets of $5,006 million against $3,119 million net required assets as of December 31, 2023. The sufficiency ratio as of December 31, 2024, was 167% or $2,052 million above the PMIERs requirements, compared to 161% or $1,887 million above the PMIERs requirements as of December 31, 2023. Our PMIERs required assets benefited from the application of a 0.30 multiplier applied to the risk-based required asset amount factor for certain non-performing loans as defined under PMIERs. The application of the 0.30 multiplier to all eligible delinquencies provided $28 million of benefit to our December 31, 2024, PMIERs required assets compared to $73 million of benefit as of December 31, 2023. Our PMIERs required assets also benefited from a reinsurance credit of $1,885 million and $1,714 million related to third-party reinsurance as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These amounts are gross of any incremental reinsurance benefit from the elimination of the 0.30 multiplier. Per guidance released by the GSEs in the third quarter of 2024, use of the multiplier will be discontinued effective March 31, 2025. 
On January 8, 2024, S&P Global Ratings upgraded the long-term financial strength and issuer credit ratings of EMICO from BBB+ to A-.   
Subsequent to year end on January 17, 2025, Fitch upgraded the long-term financial strength and issuer credit ratings of EMICO from A- to A.
Recent transactions.
 In November 2023, we contributed $250 million into Enact Re, our wholly owned Bermuda-based subsidiary. This contribution supported the increase to the ceding percentage of our previously announced affiliate quota share agreements from 7.5% to 12.5% during the first quarter of 2024, and a new quota share reinsurance agreement that cedes 12.5% of EMICO’s 2024 new insurance written. The contribution also supports new business opportunities, which primarily includes the continued execution of GSE credit risk transfer. 
On January 3, 2024, we entered into a quota share reinsurance agreement with a panel of third-party reinsurers. Under the agreement, EMICO will cede approximately 21% of a portion of its new insurance written from January 1, 2024, through December 31, 2024.
On January 30, 2024, we executed an excess-of-loss reinsurance transaction with a panel of reinsurers, which, following an amendment in December 2024, provides up to $270 million of reinsurance coverage on a portion of current and expected new insurance written for the 2024 book year, effective January 1, 2024.
On May 28, 2024, we issued our 2029 Notes for an aggregate principal amount of $750 million. We used the proceeds from the issuance to redeem our 2025 Notes.
On June 25, 2024, we executed an excess-of-loss reinsurance transaction with a panel of reinsurers, which provides approximately $90 million of reinsurance coverage on a portion of existing mortgage insurance written from July 1, 2023, through December 31, 2023, effective June 1, 2024.
72
On November 26, 2024, we entered into two quota share reinsurance transactions with a panel of reinsurers. Under the agreements, and subject to certain conditions, EMICO will cede approximately 27% of a portion of expected new insurance written for the period from January 1, 2025, through December 31, 2025, and will cede approximately 27% of a portion of expected new insurance written for the period from January 1, 2026, through December 31, 2026.
Subsequent to year end, in January 2025, we entered into two excess-of-loss reinsurance transactions that cover a portion of expected new insurance written from January 1, 2025, through December 31, 2025, and January 1, 2026, through December 31, 2026, and provide reinsurance coverage of approximately $225 million and $260 million, respectively. 
Capital returns.
 On April 26, 2022, our Board of Directors approved the initiation of a dividend program under which the Company intends to pay a quarterly cash dividend, subject to approval by our Board of Directors each quarter. We paid quarterly dividends of $0.14 per share in March of 2023 and May, September and December of 2022. We paid quarterly dividends of $0.16 per share in June, September and December 2023 and March 2024. On May 1, 2024, we also announced an increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.185 per share which was paid in June, September and December 2024. In November 2024 EMICO completed a distribution to EHI that supports our ability to pay a quarterly dividend. Future
 dividend payments are subject to quarterly review and approval
 by our Board of Directors and Genworth and will be targeted to be paid in the third month of each quarter. 
On May 1, 2024, we announced the authorization of a share repurchase program that allows for the repurchase of up to $250 million of EHI’s common stock. Under this program, share repurchases may be made at our discretion from time to time in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, or by other means, including through Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 trading plans. In conjunction with this authorization, we have entered into an agreement with Genworth Holdings, Inc. to repurchase its EHI shares on a pro rata basis as part of the program. The share repurchase program is not expected to change Genworth’s ownership interest in Enact post-completion. We expect the timing and amount of any future share repurchases will be opportunistic and will depend on a variety of factors, including EHI’s share price, capital availability, business and market conditions, regulatory requirements, and debt covenant restrictions. The program does not obligate EHI to acquire any amount of common stock, it may be suspended or terminated at any time at the Company’s discretion without prior notice, and it does not have a specified expiration date.
Returning capital to shareholders, balanced with our growth and risk management priorities, remains a key commitment as we look to drive shareholder value through time. Future return of capital will be shaped by our capital prioritization framework: supporting our existing policyholders, growing our mortgage insurance business, funding attractive new business opportunities and returning capital to shareholders. Our total return of capital will also be based on our view of the prevailing and prospective macroeconomic conditions, regulatory landscape and business performance.

Detailed discussions of our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022, including the year-over-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022, that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K can be found in Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024.
Year Ended December 31, 2024 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2023 
Revenues
Premiums increased mainly attributable to higher average IIF and higher assumed premiums, consisting primarily of Enact Re’s GSE credit risk transfer participation and multifamily reinsurance. This was partially offset by higher ceded premium. The net earned premium rate was 36 basis points, relatively consistent with 2023.
Net investment income increased primarily due to higher investment yields due to elevated interest rates coupled with higher average invested assets. 
74
Net investment losses during 2024 and 2023 were primarily driven by realized losses on the sale of fixed maturity securities as part of our yield optimization strategy that allows us to reinvest sales proceeds and recoup higher investment income. Our yield optimization strategy enables opportunistic security sales based on current and changing market conditions. We had more sales in 2024 than 2023. 
Other income includes underwriting fee revenue, equity method investment income and other revenue. 
Losses and expenses 
Losses incurred in 2024 and 2023 were impacted by 
favorable reserve adjustments
. During 2024, we released reserves of $252 million primarily on prior accident year reserves as a result of strong cure performance and loss mitigation efforts. During 2023, we recorded $241 million of reserve releases.
New primary delinquencies were 48,537 in 2024 compared to 41,617 in 2023, resulting in $287 million and $265 million of losses, respectively.

Excludes run-off business. 
Acquisition and operating expenses, net of deferrals, increased primarily attributable to the impact of our restructuring initiatives. 
Amortization of DAC and intangibles declined due to lower DAC amortization as a result of elevated persistency, driven by high mortgage rates and lower software amortization.
The expense ratio was consistent due to growth in and premiums and expenses.
The loss on debt extinguishment relates to the expenses incurred associated with the redemption of our 2025 Notes. 
Interest expense primarily relates to our 2025 Notes and 2029 Notes. For additional details see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. 
Provision for income taxes 
The effective tax rate was 21.6% and 21.8% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, consistent with the United States corporate federal income tax rate.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
We use a non-U.S. GAAP (“non-GAAP”) financial measure entitled “adjusted operating income.” This non-GAAP financial measure is additionally evaluated by both management and our Board of Directors. 
Management also uses adjusted operating income (loss) as a basis for determining awards and compensation for senior management and to evaluate performance on a basis comparable to that used by analysts.
 This measure has been established in order to increase transparency for the purposes of evaluating our core operating trends and enabling more meaningful comparisons with our peers. Although “adjusted operating income” is a non-GAAP financial measure, for the reasons discussed above we believe this measure aids in understanding the underlying performance of our operations.
75
“Adjusted operating income” is defined as U.S. GAAP net income excluding the effects of (i) net investment gains (losses) and (ii) restructuring costs and infrequent or unusual non-operating items.
(i)
Net investment gains (losses)—The recognition of realized investment gains or losses can vary significantly across periods as the activity is highly discretionary based on the timing of individual securities sales due to such factors as market opportunities or exposure management. Trends in the profitability of our fundamental operating activities can be more clearly identified without the fluctuations of these realized gains and losses. We do not view them to be indicative of our fundamental operating activities. Therefore, these items are excluded from our calculation of adjusted operating income.
(ii)
Restructuring costs and infrequent or unusual non-operating items are also excluded from adjusted operating income if, in our opinion, they are not indicative of overall operating trends.
(iii)
Gains (losses) on the extinguishment of debt are also excluded from adjusted operating income, as they are not indicative of overall operating trends.
In reporting non-GAAP measures in the future, we may make other adjustments for expenses and gains we do not consider reflective of core operating performance in a particular period. We may disclose other non-GAAP operating measures if we believe that such a presentation would be helpful for investors to evaluate our operating condition by including additional information. 
Adjusted operating income is not a measure of total profitability, and therefore should not be considered in isolation or viewed as a substitute for U.S. GAAP net income. Our definition of adjusted operating income may not be comparable to similarly named measures reported by other companies, including our peers.
Adjustments to reconcile net income to adjusted operating income assume a 21% tax rate (unless otherwise indicated).

We have continued to see a greater concentration of loans with higher DTI ratios. This is in line with market trends as elevated mortgage rates and recent home price appreciation have put pressure on affordability. We believe the levels are in line with our current risk appetite as we consider layered risk across multiple risk attributes, pricing and our portfolio credit mix.  
Insurance in-force and Risk in-force 
IIF increased largely from NIW and elevated persistency in the current year, partially offset by lapses and cancellations. Primary persistency rate was 83% and 85% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. RIF increased primarily as a result of higher IIF.

Delinquent loans and claims 
Our delinquency management process begins with notification by the loan servicer of a delinquency on an insured loan. “Delinquency” is defined in our master policies as the borrower’s failure to pay when due an amount equal to the scheduled monthly mortgage payment under the terms of the mortgage. Generally, our master policies require an insured to notify us of a delinquency if the borrower fails to make two consecutive monthly mortgage payments prior to the due date of the next mortgage payment. We generally consider a loan to be delinquent and establish required reserves after the insured notifies us that the borrower has failed to make two scheduled mortgage payments. Borrowers default for a variety of reasons, including a reduction of income, unemployment, divorce, illness/death, inability to manage credit, falling home prices and interest rate levels. Borrowers may cure delinquencies by making all of the delinquent loan payments, agreeing to a loan modification, or by selling the property in full satisfaction of all amounts due under the mortgage. In most cases, delinquencies that are not cured result in a claim under our policy.

Direct primary case reserves exclude LAE, pool, IBNR and reinsurance reserves. 
The total reserves as a percentage of RIF declined as of December 31, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023 as we have experienced cures among long-term delinquencies with higher reserves and have reduced the expected claim rates on new delinquencies. 
The ratio of the claim paid to the current risk in-force for a loan is referred to as “claim severity.” The current risk in-force is equal to the unpaid principal amount multiplied by the coverage percentage. The main determinants of claim severity are the age of the mortgage loan, the value of the underlying property, accrued interest on the loan, expenses advanced by the insured and foreclosure expenses. These amounts depend partly upon the time required to complete foreclosure, which varies depending upon state laws. Pre-foreclosure sales, acquisitions and other early workout and claim administration actions help to reduce overall claim severity. Our average primary mortgage insurance claim severity was 99%, 97% and 94% for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The average claim severities have been impacted by low claim volumes and lifetime home price appreciation. These figures do not include the effects of agreements on non-performing loans. 
Primary insurance delinquency rates differ from region to region in the United States at any one time depending upon economic conditions and cyclical growth patterns. Delinquency rates are shown by region based upon the location of the underlying property, rather than the location of the lender. The table

The number of delinquencies often does not correlate directly with the number of claims received because delinquencies may cure. The rate at which delinquencies cure is influenced by borrowers’ financial resources and circumstances and regional economic differences. Whether a delinquency leads to a claim correlates highly with the borrower’s equity at the time of delinquency, as it influences the borrower’s willingness to continue to make payments, the borrower’s or the insured’s ability to sell the home for an amount sufficient to satisfy all amounts due under the mortgage loan, and the borrower’s financial ability to continue making payments. When we receive notice of a delinquency, we use our proprietary model to determine whether a delinquent loan is a candidate for a modification. When our model identifies such a candidate, our loan workout specialists prioritize cases for loss mitigation based upon the likelihood that the loan will result in a claim. Loss mitigation actions include loan modification, 
87
extension of credit to bring a loan current, foreclosure forbearance, pre-foreclosure sale and deed-in-lieu. These loss mitigation efforts often are an effective way to reduce our claim exposure and ultimate payouts.

Loss reserves in policy years 2008 and prior are outsized compared to their representation of RIF. The size of these policy years at origination, particularly 2005 through 2008, combined with the significant decline in home prices led to significant losses in policy years prior to 2009. Although uncertainty remains with respect to the ultimate losses we will experience on these policy years, they have become a smaller percentage of our total mortgage insurance portfolio. Loss reserves have shifted to newer book years in line with changes in RIF. As of December 31, 2024, our 2017 and newer policy years represented approximately 96% of our primary RIF and 84% of our total direct primary case reserves.
Investment Portfolio
Our investment portfolio is affected by factors described below, each of which in turn may be affected by current macroeconomic conditions as noted above in “—Trends and Conditions.” The investment portfolios of our insurance subsidiaries are directed by the Enact Investment Committee, a management-level committee, with Genworth serving as the primary investment manager. The investment portfolio of EHI is directed by a separate management-level EHI Investment Committee with a third-party investment manager. These parties, with oversight from our Board of Directors and our senior management team, are responsible for the execution of our investment strategy. Our investment portfolio is an important component of our consolidated financial results and represents our primary source of claims paying resources. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of a diverse mix of highly rated fixed maturity securities and is designed to achieve the following objectives: 
•
Meet policyholder obligations through maintenance of sufficient liquidity; 
•
Preserve capital; 
•
Generate investment income; 
•
Maximize statutory capital; and 
•
Increase shareholder value, among other objectives. 
89
To achieve our portfolio objectives, our investment strategy focuses primarily on: 
•
Our business outlook, including current and expected future investment conditions; 
•
Investment selection based on fundamental, research-driven strategies; 
•
Diversification across a mix of fixed income, low-volatility investments while actively pursuing strategies to enhance yield; 
•
Regular evaluation and optimization of our asset class mix; 
•
Continuous monitoring of investment quality, duration and liquidity; 
•
Regulatory capital requirements; and 
•
Restriction of investments correlated to the residential mortgage market.

We manage credit risk by analyzing issuers, transaction structures and any associated collateral. We also manage credit risk through country, industry, sector and issuer diversification and prudent asset allocation practices. 
We primarily mitigate interest rate risk by employing a buy and hold investment philosophy that seeks to match fixed income maturities with expected liability cash flows in modestly adverse economic scenarios.

Our most significant source of operating cash flows is from premiums received from our insurance policies, while our most significant uses of operating cash flows are generally for claims paid on our insured policies and our operating expenses. Net cash provided by operating activities increased largely due to higher net investment income and premiums. Cash flows from operations were also impacted by changes in reserves and unearned premiums.
Investing activities are primarily related to purchases, sales and maturities of our investment portfolio. Net cash used in investing activities increased as a result of purchases of fixed maturity securities outpacing maturities and sales in the current year due to the deployment of operating cash flows. 
In 2024, our cash flows from financing activities included the issuance of our 2029 Notes and the redemption of our 2025 Notes. Financing activities for 2024 also included dividends paid of $112 million and share repurchases of $244 million. The amount and timing of future dividends is discussed within “—Trends and Conditions” as well as below. During 2023 and 2022, our cash flows used in financing activities included dividends paid of $213 million and $251 million, respectively, and share repurchases of $88 million and $2 million, respectively.
Capital Resources and Financing Activities 
We issued our 2029 Notes in the second quarter of 2024 with interest payable semi-annually in arrears in May and November of each year. The 2029 Notes mature on May 28, 2029. We may redeem the 2029 Notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to April 28, 2029, at our option, by paying an additional premium. At any time on or after April 28, 2029, we may redeem the 2029 Notes, in whole or in part, at our option, at 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The 2029 Notes contain customary events of default which, subject to certain notice and cure conditions, can result in the 
91
acceleration of the principal and accrued interest on the outstanding notes if we breach the terms of the indenture. 
The proceeds from our 2029 Notes, along with other available cash, were used to redeem our 2025 Notes during the second quarter of 2024.
On June 30, 2022, we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders that provides for a five-year, unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Facility”) in the initial aggregate principal amount of $200 million. We may use borrowings under the Facility for working capital needs and general corporate purposes, including the execution of dividends to our shareholders and capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries. The Facility contains several covenants, including financial covenants relating to minimum net worth, capital and liquidity levels, maximum debt to capitalization level and PMIERs compliance. We are in compliance with all covenants of the Facility and the Facility remained undrawn through December 31, 2024.
We continually evaluate opportunities based upon market conditions to further increase our financial flexibility including through raising additional capital, restructuring or refinancing some or all of our outstanding debt or pursuing other options such as reinsurance or credit risk transfer transactions. There can be no guarantee that any such opportunities will be available on favorable terms or at all.
Restrictions on the Payment of Dividends
The ability of our regulated insurance operating subsidiaries to pay dividends and distributions to us is restricted by certain provisions of North Carolina insurance laws. Our insurance subsidiaries may pay dividends only from unassigned surplus; payments made from sources other than unassigned surplus, such as paid-in and contributed surplus, are categorized as distributions. Notice of all dividends must be submitted to the Commissioner of the NCDOI (the “Commissioner”) within 5 business days after declaration of the dividend, and at least 30 days before payment thereof. No dividend may be paid until 30 days after the Commissioner has received notice of the declaration thereof and (i) has not within that period disapproved the payment or (ii) has approved the payment within the 30-day period. Any distribution, regardless of amount, requires that same 30-day notice to the Commissioner, but also requires the Commissioner’s affirmative approval before being paid. Based on our estimated statutory results and in accordance with applicable dividend restrictions, our insurance subsidiaries have the capacity to pay dividends of $153 million from unassigned surplus as of December 31, 2024, with 30-day advance notice to the Commissioner of the intent to pay. In addition to dividends and distributions, alternative mechanisms, such as share repurchases, subject to any requisite regulatory approvals, may be utilized from time to time to upstream surplus.
In addition, we review multiple other considerations in parallel to determine a prospective dividend strategy for our regulated insurance operating subsidiaries. Given the regulatory focus on the reasonableness of an insurer’s surplus in relation to its outstanding liabilities and the adequacy of its surplus relative to its financial needs for any dividend, our insurance subsidiaries consider the minimum amount of policyholder surplus after giving effect to any contemplated future dividends. Regulatory minimum policyholder surplus is not codified in North Carolina law and limitations may vary based on prevailing business conditions including, but not limited to, the prevailing and future macroeconomic conditions. We estimate regulators would require a minimum policyholder surplus of approximately $300 million to meet their threshold standard. We are subject to statutory accounting requirements that establish a contingency reserve of at least 50% of net earned premiums annually for ten years, after which time it is released into policyholder surplus. While we began 10-year contingency reserve releases during 2024, minimum policyholder surplus could be a limitation on the future dividends of our regulated operating subsidiaries.  
Another consideration in the development of the dividend strategies for our regulated insurance operating subsidiaries is our expected level of compliance with PMIERs. Under PMIERs, EMICO is 
92
subject to operational and financial requirements that approved insurers must meet in order to remain eligible to insure loans purchased by the GSEs.  
Our regulated insurance operating subsidiaries are also subject to statutory RTC requirements that affect the dividend strategies of our regulated operating subsidiaries. EMICO’s domiciliary regulator, the NCDOI, requires the maintenance of a statutory RTC ratio not to exceed 25:1. See “—Risk-to-Capital Ratio” for additional RTC trend analysis. 
We consider potential future dividends compared to the prior year statutory net income in the evaluation of dividend strategies for our regulated operating subsidiaries. We also consider the dividend payout ratio, or the ratio of potential future dividends compared to the estimated U.S. GAAP net income, in the evaluation of our dividend strategies. In either case, we do not have prescribed target or maximum thresholds, but we do evaluate the reasonableness of a potential dividend relative to the actual or estimated income generated in the proceeding or preceding calendar year after giving consideration to prevailing business conditions including, but not limited to the prevailing and future macroeconomic conditions. In addition, the dividend strategies of our regulated operating subsidiaries are made in consultation with Genworth. 
During 2024, EMICO completed distributions of approximately $270 million and $230 million in March and November, respectively, that supported our ability to pay cash dividends. We intend to use future EMICO distributions to fund the quarterly dividend as well as to bolster our financial flexibility at EHI and return additional capital to shareholders.
The credit agreement entered into in connection with the Facility contains customary restrictions on EHI’s ability to pay cash dividends. Under the credit agreement, EHI is permitted to make cash distributions (1) so long as no Default or Event of Default (as each are defined in the credit agreement) has occurred and is continuing and EHI is in pro forma compliance with its financial covenants as described below at the time of and after giving effect to such payment, (2) within 60 days of declaration of any cash dividend so long as the payment was permitted under the credit agreement at the time of such declaration and (3) other customary exceptions as more fully set forth in the credit agreement. 
The credit agreement requires EHI to maintain the following financial covenants: a minimum consolidated net worth equal to the sum of (i) 72.5% of EHI’s consolidated net worth as of June 30, 2022 (“the Closing Date”), (ii) 50% of EHI’s positive consolidated net income for each fiscal quarter after the Closing Date and (iii) 50% of any increase in EHI’s consolidated net worth after the Closing Date resulting from equity issuances or capital contributions; in respect of EMICO, a minimum total adjusted capital amount equal to 72.5% of EMICO’s total adjusted capital as of the Closing Date; a maximum debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 0.35 to 1.00; a minimum liquidity level of $25,000,000; and compliance with all applicable financial requirements under the Private Mortgage Insurer Eligibility Requirements published by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and the Federal National Mortgage Association. For purposes of determining EHI’s compliance with the foregoing financial covenants, the consolidated net worth metric, total adjusted capital metric, debt-to-capitalization ratio and liquidity metric (including, in each case, any component thereof) are each calculated as set forth in the credit agreement.
In addition to the restrictions described above, all dividends from EHI are subject to Genworth consent and EHI Board of Directors approval.
Risk-to-Capital Ratio 
We compute our RTC ratio on a separate company statutory basis, as well as for our combined insurance operations. The RTC ratio is net RIF divided by policyholders’ surplus plus statutory contingency reserve. Our net RIF represents RIF, net of reinsurance ceded, and excludes risk on policies that are currently delinquent and for which loss reserves have been established. Statutory capital consists primarily of statutory policyholders’ surplus (which increases as a result of statutory net income and decreases as a result of statutory net loss and dividends paid), plus the statutory contingency reserve. The statutory contingency reserve is reported as a liability on the statutory balance sheet. 
93
Certain states have insurance laws or regulations that require a mortgage insurer to maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital (including the statutory contingency reserve) relative to its level of RIF in order for the mortgage insurer to continue to write new business. While formulations of minimum capital vary in certain states, the most common measure applied allows for a maximum permitted RTC ratio of 25:1.

Liquidity 
As of December 31, 2024, we maintained liquidity in the form of cash and cash equivalents of $599 million compared to $616 million as of December 31, 2023, and we also held significant levels of investment-grade fixed maturity securities that can be monetized should our cash and cash equivalents be insufficient to meet our obligations. 
On June 30, 2022, we entered into a five-year, unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders in the initial aggregate principal amount of $200 million. The Facility matures in June 2027, but under certain conditions EHI may need to repay any outstanding amounts and terminate the Facility earlier than the maturity date. The Facility may be used for working capital needs and general corporate purposes, including the execution of dividends to our shareholders and capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries. The Facility has remained undrawn through December 31, 2024. 
The principal sources of liquidity in our business currently include insurance premiums, net investment income and cash flows from investment sales and maturities. We believe that the operating cash flows generated by our mortgage insurance subsidiary will provide the funds necessary to satisfy our claim payments, operating expenses and taxes in both the short-term and long-term. However, our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory and other capital restrictions with respect to the payment of dividends. We currently have no material financing commitments, such as lines of credit or guarantees, that are expected to affect our liquidity, other than the 2029 Notes and the Facility.

Financial Strength Ratings
Ratings with respect to the financial strength of operating subsidiaries are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in us and our ability to market our products. Rating organizations review the financial performance and condition of most insurers and provide opinions regarding financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet obligations to policyholders. 
The financial strength ratings of our operating companies are not designed to be, and do not serve as, measures of protection or valuation offered to our stockholders. We cannot predict with any certainty the impact to us from any future disruptions in the credit markets or downgrades by one or more of the rating agencies of the financial strength ratings of our insurance company subsidiaries and/or the credit ratings of our holding company. We also cannot predict the impact on our ratings or future ratings of actions taken with respect to Genworth.
The following EMICO financial strength ratings have been independently assigned by third-party rating organizations and represent our current ratings, which are subject to change.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments
We enter into agreements and other relationships with third parties in the ordinary course of our operations. However, we do not believe that our cash flow requirements can be assessed based upon analysis of these obligations, as the funding of these future cash obligations will be from future cash flows from premiums and investment income. Future cash outflows, whether they are contractual obligations or not, also will vary based upon our future needs. Although some outflows are fixed, others depend on future events. An example of obligations that are fixed include future lease payments. An example of obligations that will vary include insurance liabilities that depend on losses incurred. Refer to Note 3, Note 7 and Note 12 of our audited consolidated financial statements for discussion of borrowings and commitments and contingencies.  
The liability for loss reserves as of December 31, 2024, represents our current best estimate; however, there may be future adjustments to this estimate and related assumptions. Such adjustments, reflecting any variety of new and adverse trends, could possibly be significant, and result in future increases to reserves by amounts that could be material to our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.  Refer to Note 5 in our audited consolidated financial statements for discussion of our loss reserves.
Refer to Note 2 in our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 for a discussion of recently adopted and not yet adopted accounting standards. 
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We own and manage a large investment portfolio of various holdings, types and maturities. Investment income is one of our material sources of revenue and the investment portfolio represents the primary resource supporting operational and claim payments. The assets within the investment portfolio are exposed to the same factors that affect overall financial market performance. While our investment 
95
portfolio is exposed to factors affecting markets worldwide, it is most sensitive to fluctuations in the drivers of United States markets.
We manage market risk via our defined investment policy guidelines implemented by our investment managers with oversight from our Board of Directors and our senior management. Important drivers of our market risk exposure that we monitor and manage include but are not limited to:
•
Changes to the level of interest rates
. Increasing interest rates may reduce the value of certain fixed-rate bonds held in the investment portfolio. Higher rates may cause variable-rate assets to generate additional income. Decreasing rates will have the reverse impact. Significant changes in interest rates can also affect persistency and claim rates that may require that the investment portfolio be restructured to better align it with future liabilities and claim payments. Such restructuring may cause investments to be liquidated when market conditions are adverse.
•
Changes to the term structure of interest rates
. Rising or falling rates typically change by different amounts along the yield curve. These changes may have unforeseen impacts on the value of certain assets.
•
Market volatility/changes in the real or perceived credit quality of investments
. Deterioration in the quality of investments, identified through changes to our own or third-party (e.g., rating agency) assessments, will reduce the value and potentially the liquidity of investments.
•
Concentration risk
. If the investment portfolio is highly concentrated in one asset, or in multiple assets whose values are highly correlated, the value of the total portfolio may be greatly affected by the change in value of just one asset or a group of highly correlated assets.
•
Prepayment risk
. Bonds may have call provisions that permit debtors to repay prior to maturity when it is to their advantage. This typically occurs when rates fall below the interest rate of the debt.
Market risk is measured for all investment assets at the individual security level. Market risks that are not fully captured by the quantitative analysis and material market risk changes that occur from the last reporting period to the current are discussed in “—Trends and conditions” and “—Investment Portfolio” in “Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”. 
As of December 31, 2024, the effective duration of our investments available-for-sale was 4.1 years, which means that an instantaneous parallel shift (movement up or down) in the yield curve of 100 basis points would result in a change of 4.1% in fair value of our investments available-for-sale.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
Enact Holdings, Inc.:
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Enact Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedules I to II (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 28, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Loss reserves
As described in Notes 2 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company estimates the liabilities for losses on insured mortgage loans (loss reserves) by estimating the number of loans in their inventory of delinquent loans that will result in a claim payment, which is referred to as the claim 
98
rate, and further estimating the amount of the claim payment, which is referred to as claim severity. The estimates are determined using a factor-based approach, in which assumptions of claim rates for loans in default and the average amount paid for loans that result in a claim are calculated using traditional actuarial techniques. The Company’s loss reserves were $525 million as of December 31, 2024.
We identified the assessment of the valuation of loss reserves to be a critical audit matter. Specifically, the claim severity and claim rate assumptions used to estimate reserves required especially subjective auditor judgment. Additionally, the audit effort to assess the valuation of loss reserves required the involvement of professionals with specialized knowledge and experience.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address the critical audit matter. With the assistance of actuarial professionals, we evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the valuation of loss reserves. This included controls related to the review and approval of the claim severity and claim rate reserve factors used in the estimate for loss reserves. We included actuarial professionals with specialized knowledge and experience, who assisted in:
•
Assessing the Company’s reserving methodology by comparing to accepted actuarial methodologies; and
•
Developing an independent estimate and range for a portion of the loss reserves, using the Company’s underlying historical claims and delinquency data and independently developed models and assumptions and assessing the position in the range and the year-over-year movements of the Company’s recorded loss reserves within the developed independent range.

Nature of business and organization structure 
Nature of Business 
Enact Holdings, Inc. (“EHI,” together with its subsidiaries, the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) (formerly known as Genworth Mortgage Holdings, Inc.) was a wholly owned subsidiary of Genworth Financial, Inc. (“Genworth”) since EHI’s incorporation in Delaware in 2012. In September 2021, we completed a minority initial public offering (“IPO”) of 18.4% of EHI’s common stock. 
We are engaged in the business of writing and assuming residential mortgage guaranty insurance. The insurance protects lenders and investors against certain losses resulting from nonpayment of loans secured by mortgages, deeds of trust, or other instruments constituting a lien on residential real estate.
We offer private mortgage insurance products predominantly insuring prime-based, individually underwritten residential mortgage loans (“primary mortgage insurance”). Our primary mortgage insurance enables borrowers to buy homes with a down payment of less than 20% of the home’s value. Primary mortgage insurance also facilitates the sale of these low down payment mortgage loans in the secondary mortgage market, most of which are sold to government sponsored enterprises. We also selectively enter into insurance transactions with lenders and investors, under which we insure a portfolio of loans at or after origination. 
We operate our business through our primary insurance subsidiary, Enact Mortgage Insurance Corporation, (“EMICO”), formerly known as Genworth Mortgage Insurance Corporation, with operations in all 
50
 states and the District of Columbia. EMICO is an approved insurer by the Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”). Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are government-sponsored enterprises, and we refer to them collectively as the “GSEs.” 
We have a broad customer base of mortgage lenders diversified by size, type and geography that includes large money center banks, non-bank lenders, national and local mortgage bankers, community banks and credit unions. Our largest customer accounted for approximately $
133
 million or 
11
% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024, and $
118
 million, or 
10
% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 or 2023 and no customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022.
We also offer mortgage-related insurance and reinsurance through our wholly owned Bermuda-based subsidiary, Enact Re Ltd. ("Enact Re"). We contributed $
500
 million into Enact Re during 2023. As of December 31, 2024, Enact Re reinsured EMICO’s new and existing insurance in-force under quota share reinsurance agreements and invests in new business opportunities for Enact, including assumption of excess of loss reinsurance relating to GSE risk share.
Additionally, we perform fee-based contract underwriting services for mortgage lenders. The provision of underwriting services by mortgage insurers eliminates the duplicative lender and mortgage insurer underwriting activities and expedites the approval process. 
EMICO also includes a run-off insurance block with reference properties in Mexico (“run-off business”), which is immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.

Summary of significant accounting policies 
Basis of Presentation 
Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of United States generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). Preparing financial statements in conformity with U.S. 
105
ENACT HOLDINGS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Years Ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a standalone basis. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of EHI, its subsidiaries and those entities required to be consolidated under the applicable accounting standards. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
The consolidated financial statements include allocations of certain Genworth expenses. The allocated expenses relate to various services that have historically been provided to us by Genworth, including investment management, information technology services and administrative services (such as finance, human resources and employee benefit administration). These allocations were made on a direct usage basis when identifiable, with the remainder allocated on the basis of equity, proportional effort or other relevant measures. Expenses allocated to us are not necessarily representative of the amounts that would have been incurred had we operated independently of Genworth. See Note 11 for further information regarding the allocation of Genworth expenses.

Premiums 
For monthly insurance contracts, we report premiums as revenue over the period that coverage is provided. For single premium mortgage insurance contracts, we report premiums over the estimated policy life in accordance with the expected pattern of risk emergence as further described in our accounting policy for unearned premiums. In addition, we refund post-delinquent premiums received to the insured party if the delinquent loan goes to claim. We record a liability for premiums received on the delinquent loans consistent with our expectations of ultimate claim rates.

Net Investment Income and Net Investment Gains and Losses 
Investment income is recognized when earned. Income or loss upon call or prepayment of available-for-sale fixed maturity securities is recognized in net investment income, except for hybrid securities where the income or loss upon call is recognized in net investment gains and losses. Investment gains and losses are calculated on the basis of specific identification on the trade date. 
Investment income on asset-backed securities is initially based upon yield, cash flow and prepayment assumptions at the date of purchase. Subsequent revisions in those assumptions are recorded using the retrospective or prospective method. Under the retrospective method used for asset-backed securities of high credit quality (ratings equal to or greater than “AA” or that are backed by a U.S. agency) which cannot be contractually prepaid in such a manner that we would not recover a substantial portion of the initial investment, amortized cost of the security is adjusted to the amount that would have existed had the revised assumptions been in place at the date of purchase. The adjustments to amortized cost are recorded as a charge or credit to net investment income. Under the prospective method, which is used for all other asset-backed securities, future cash flows are estimated, and interest income is recognized going forward using the new internal rate of return
. 
Other Income 
Other income primarily includes underwriting fee revenue and other revenue. Underwriting fee revenue is earned for underwriting services provided on a per-unit or per-diem basis, as defined in the underwriting agreements. Underwriting fee revenue is recognized at the point in time when the service obligation is satisfied.

Investments 
The investment portfolios of our insurance subsidiaries are managed by Genworth. We conduct the purchases, sales and related investment management decisions with the advice of Genworth. As part of 
106
ENACT HOLDINGS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Years Ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
these services, we are charged an investment management fee, as agreed between both parties. These fees are charged to investment expense and are included in net investment income in the consolidated statements of income. Refer to Note 11 for further details. Investments held at EHI are managed by a third party.
Fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale are reported in our consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Our portfolio of fixed maturity securities comprises primarily investment grade securities. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale fixed maturity securities, net of deferred income taxes, are reflected as unrealized investment gains or losses in a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“OCI”).

Allowance for Credit Losses on Available-For-Sale Securities 
Available-for-sale fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position are evaluated  to determine whether the decline in fair value is related to credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, we consider the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency/agencies and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, an allowance for credit losses is recorded, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Estimating the cash flows expected to be collected is a quantitative and qualitative process that incorporates information received from third-party sources along with internal assumptions and judgments. When developing the estimate of cash flows expected to be collected, we utilize an analytical model that provides for various loss scenarios and considers the industry sector, current levels of subordination, geographic location and other relevant characteristics of the security or underlying assets, as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts. Losses are written off against the allowance when deemed uncollectible or when we intend to sell or expect we will be required to sell a security prior to recovering our amortized cost. We exclude accrued interest related to available-for-sale fixed maturity securities from the estimate of allowance for credit losses. Accrued interest is included in accrued investment income in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. We do not measure an allowance for credit losses related to accrued interest as uncollectible accrued interest related to our available-for-sale fixed maturity securities is written off after 90 days and once collectability is determined to be uncertain and not probable. Amounts written off related to accrued interest are recorded as a credit loss expense included in net investment gains (losses).

Equity Method Investments 
Investments in which we are deemed to exert significant influence, but not control, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Equity method investments, which are not material as of December 31, 2024, are recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets with their related income recorded within other income in the consolidated statements of income.

Fair Value Measurements 
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We have fixed maturity securities and short-term investments, which are carried at fair value. 
Fair value measurements are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our view of market assumptions in the absence of observable market information. We utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. 
107
ENACT HOLDINGS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Years Ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
All assets and liabilities carried at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: 
•
Level 1—Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. 
•
Level 2—Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations for which inputs are observable or where those significant value drivers are observable. 
•
Level 3—Instruments for which significant value drivers are unobservable. 
Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments whose value is based on quoted market prices such as equity securities and actively traded mutual fund investments. 
Level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued using industry-standard pricing methodologies, models or other valuation methodologies. These models are primarily industry-standard models that consider various inputs, such as interest rate, credit spread and foreign exchange rates for the underlying financial instruments. All significant inputs are observable, or derived from observable, information in the marketplace or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace. Financial instruments in this category primarily include: certain public and private corporate fixed maturity securities; government or agency securities; and certain asset-backed securities. 
Level 3 comprises financial instruments whose fair value is estimated based on industry-standard pricing methodologies and internally developed models utilizing significant inputs not based on, nor corroborated by, readily available market information. In certain instances, this category may also utilize non-binding broker quotes. This category primarily consists of certain less liquid fixed maturity securities where we cannot corroborate the significant valuation inputs with market observable data. 
As of each reporting period, all assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability, such as the relative impact on the fair value as a result of including a particular input. We review the fair value hierarchy classifications each reporting period. Changes in the observability of the valuation attributes may result in a reclassification of certain financial assets or liabilities. Such reclassifications are reported as transfers in and out of Level 3 at the beginning fair value for the reporting period in which the changes occur. See Note 4 for additional information related to fair value measurements.

Cash and Cash Equivalents 
Certificates of deposit, money market funds and other highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less are considered cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows. Items with maturities greater than three months but less than one year at the time of acquisition are generally considered short-term investments.

Accrued Investment Income 
Accrued investment income consists primarily of interest earned on available-for-sale securities. Interest is recognized on an accrual basis, and dividends are recorded as earned on the ex-dividend date. Interest income is not recorded on fixed maturity securities in default and fixed maturity securities delinquent more than 90 days or where collection of interest is improbable.

Deferred Acquisition Costs (“DAC”)
Acquisition costs include costs that are directly related to the successful acquisition of new insurance contracts. Acquisition costs are deferred and amortized to the extent they are recoverable from future profits. Acquisition costs primarily consist of underwriting costs and are amortized in proportion to 
108
ENACT HOLDINGS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Years Ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
estimated gross profit. Judgment is used in evaluating these estimates and the assumptions upon which they are based. The use of different assumptions may have a significant effect on the amortization of deferred acquisition costs.

Deferred acquisition costs were $
23.8
 million and $
25.0
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Amortization of DAC was $
7.0
 million, $
7.2
 million and $
7.8
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and was included within amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles in the consolidated statements of income. 
Premium Deficiency Reserves (“PDR”) 
Premium deficiency reserves are established, if necessary, when the present value of expected future losses and expenses exceeds the present value of expected future premium and already established reserves. The discount rate used in the calculation is based upon our pretax investment yield. We do not utilize anticipated investment income on our assets when evaluating the need for a PDR. The calculation of premium deficiency reserves requires the use of significant judgments and estimates to determine the present value of future premium and present value of expected losses and expenses in our business. The differences between the actual results and our estimates could vary materially. We completed a PDR analysis as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and determined that no PDR was required.

Reinsurance 
Premium revenue, losses and acquisition and operating expenses, net of deferrals, are reported net of the amounts relating to reinsurance ceded to other companies. The cost of reinsurance is accounted for over the terms of the related treaties using assumptions consistent with those used to account for the underlying reinsured policies. See Note 6 for details.

Loss Reserves 
Loss reserves represent the amount needed to provide for the estimated ultimate cost of settling claims relating to insured events that have occurred on or before the end of the respective reporting period. The estimated liability includes requirements for future payments of: (a) losses that have been reported to the insurer; (b) losses related to insured events that have occurred but that have not been reported to the insurer as of the date the liability is estimated; and (c) loss adjustment expenses (“LAE”). Loss adjustment expenses include costs incurred in the claim settlement process such as legal fees and costs to record, process and adjust claims. Consistent with U.S. GAAP and industry accounting practices, we do not establish loss reserves for future claims on insured loans that are not in default or believed to be in default. 
Estimates and actuarial assumptions used for establishing loss reserves involve the exercise of significant judgment, and changes in assumptions or deviations of actual experience from assumptions can have material impacts on our loss reserves and net income (loss). Because these assumptions relate to factors that are not known in advance, change over time, are difficult to accurately predict and are inherently uncertain, we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts we will pay for actual claims or the timing of those payments. The sources of uncertainty affecting the estimates are numerous and include factors internal and external to us. Internal factors include, but are not limited to, changes in the mix of exposures, loss mitigation activities and claim settlement practices. Significant external influences include changes in home prices, unemployment, government housing policies, state foreclosure timeline, general economic conditions, interest rates, tax policy, credit availability and mortgage products. Small changes in assumptions or small deviations of actual experience from assumptions can have, and in the past have had, material impacts on our reserves, results of operations and financial condition. 
We establish reserves to recognize the estimated liability for losses and LAE related to defaults on insured mortgage loans. Loss reserves are established by estimating the number of loans in our inventory of delinquent loans that will result in a claim payment, which is referred to as the claim rate, and further 
109
ENACT HOLDINGS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Years Ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
estimating the amount of the claim payment, which is referred to as claim severity. The estimates are determined using a factor-based approach, in which assumptions of claim rates for loans in default and the average amount paid for loans that result in a claim are calculated using traditional actuarial techniques. Over time, as the status of the underlying delinquent loans moves toward foreclosure and the likelihood of the associated claim loss increases, the amount of the loss reserves associated with the potential claims may also increase. 
Management monitors actual experience, and where circumstances warrant, will revise its assumptions. Our liability for loss reserves is reviewed regularly, with changes in our estimates of future claims recorded through net income. Estimation of losses are based on historical claim and cure experience and covered exposures and is inherently judgmental. Future developments may result in losses greater or less than the liability for loss reserves provided.

Unearned Premiums 
Premiums written on single premium policies and annual premium policies are initially deferred as unearned premium reserve and earned over the policy life. A portion of the revenue from single premium policies is recognized in premiums earned in the current period, and the remaining portion is deferred as unearned premiums and earned over the estimated expiration of risk of the policy. If single premium policies are cancelled and the premium is non-refundable, then the remaining unearned premium related to each cancelled policy is recognized to earned premiums upon notification of the cancellation. For borrower-paid mortgage insurance, coverage ceases at the earlier of prepayment, or when the original principal is amortized to a 78% loan-to-value ratio in accordance with the Homeowners Protection Act of 1998. 
We periodically review our premium earnings recognition models with any adjustments to the estimates reflected as a cumulative adjustment on a retrospective basis in current period net income. These reviews include the consideration of recent and projected loss and policy cancellation experience, and adjustments to the estimated earnings patterns are made, if warranted.
Share-Based Compensation 
Prior to our IPO, certain of our employees participated in Genworth’s incentive plans, under which our employees were granted share-based awards, including stock options. In 2021, we approved an incentive compensation plan that allows EHI to grant share-based awards to its employees and directors.  
For grants from both of these plans, compensation expense is recognized based on a grant date fair value, adjusted for expected forfeitures, through the income statement over the respective vesting period of the awards. See Note 10 for additional information related to share-based compensation.

Employee Benefit Plans 
Our employees are provided a number of Genworth employee benefits. Genworth, as sponsor of these employee benefit plans, is ultimately responsible for maintenance of these plans in compliance with applicable laws. The plans are accounted for by Genworth in accordance with relevant accounting guidance. We account for these employee benefit plans as multiemployer benefit plans. Accordingly, we do not record an asset or liability to recognize the funded status of the employee benefit plans. Expenses related to employee benefits are included within acquisition and operating expenses, net of deferrals in the consolidated statements of income. See Note 9 for additional information related to employee benefits.

Income Taxes 
We determine deferred tax assets and/or liabilities by multiplying the differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting bases for assets and liabilities by the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such differences are recovered or settled if there is no change in law. The effect on 
110
ENACT HOLDINGS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Years Ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in net income (loss) in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances on deferred tax assets are estimated based on our assessment of the realizability of such amounts. 
We have elected to participate in a single U.S. consolidated income tax return filing (the “Genworth consolidated return”). All Genworth companies domesticated in the United States are included in the Genworth consolidated return as allowed by the tax law and regulations. We have a tax sharing agreement in place and all intercompany balances related to this agreement are settled at least annually. Refer to Note 8 for further details.

Variable Interest Entities 
We are involved in certain entities that are considered variable interest entities (“VIEs”) as defined under U.S. GAAP, and, accordingly, we evaluate the VIE to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary and are required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the entity. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the enterprise that has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impacts the VIE’s economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The determination of the primary beneficiary for a VIE can be complex and requires management judgment regarding the expected results of the entity and how those results are absorbed by variable interest holders, as well as which party has the power to direct activities that most significantly impact the performance of the VIEs. 
Our involvement with VIEs consists of excess-of-loss reinsurance agreements with special purpose insurers domiciled in Bermuda. These entities finance the reinsurance coverage by issuing mortgage insurance-linked notes to unaffiliated investors. The assets of the VIEs are deposited in reinsurance trusts for our benefit that will be the source of reinsurance claim payments. Our involvement with these VIEs does not result in the unilateral power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the VIEs’ economic performance or result in the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits. Accordingly, consolidation of the VIEs is not required. See
 Note 6 f
or details.

Leases
Our leased assets are classified as operating leases and consist of office space in two locations in the United States. Lease payments included in the calculation of our lease liability include fixed amounts contained within each rental agreement and variable lease payments that are based upon an index or rate. We have elected to combine lease and non-lease components, as permitted under the accounting guidance, and as a result, non-lease components are included in the calculation of our lease liability as opposed to being separated and accounted for as consideration under revenue recognition accounting. The right-of-use asset and the lease liability are included in other assets and other liabilities, respectively.

Accounting Pronouncements Adopted 
Segment Reporting
For our reporting as of December 2024, we have adopted guidance under ASC 280 related to segment reporting disclosures. The update requires incremental disclosure around significant segment expenses, measures of segment profit or loss used by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) and the CODM’s use of these metrics. The guidance also requires segment disclosures for entities with a single reportable segment. See Note 17 for our added disclosure.
Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 
Income Tax Disclosure
In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued new accounting guidance to improve income tax disclosures. The guidance requires annual disclosure of specific categories in the income tax rate reconciliation, separate disclosure of additional information related to 
111
ENACT HOLDINGS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Years Ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold and additional disclosures about income taxes paid, among other qualitative and quantitative disclosure improvements. This guidance is effective for us for annual reporting periods beginning on January 1, 2025 using the prospective method, with early adoption permitted, which we do not intend to elect. The guidance will have no impact on our consolidated financial statements but will require expanded annual disclosures. We are currently evaluating the impact the guidance may have on our processes, controls and disclosures.
Income Statement Disaggregation
In November 2024, the FASB issued new accounting guidance to require disaggregated disclosures in the notes to the financial statements of certain categories of expenses included in our consolidated statements of income, including employee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset amortization. This guidance is effective for us for annual reporting periods beginning on January 1, 2027 and interim periods beginning on January 1, 2028 using the prospective or retrospective method, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact the guidance may have on our processes, controls and disclosures.

We did not recognize an allowance for credit losses on securities in an unrealized loss position included in the table above. Based on a qualitative and quantitative review of the issuers of the securities, we believe the unrealized losses are largely due to changes in interest rates and recent market volatility and are not indicative of credit losses. The issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments. 
For all securities in an unrealized loss position without an allowance for credit losses, we expect to recover the amortized cost based on our estimate of the amount and timing of cash flows to be collected. We do not intend to sell, nor do we expect that we will be required to sell, these securities prior to recovering our amortized cost.

Fair Value 
Recurring Fair Value Measurements 
We hold fixed maturity securities and short-term investments, which are carried at fair value. The fair value of fixed maturity securities and short-term investments are estimated primarily based on information derived from third-party pricing services (“pricing services”), broker quotes and/or internal models, which use a market approach, income approach or a combination of the market and income approach depending on the type of instrument and availability of information. In general, a market approach is utilized if there is readily available and relevant market activity for an individual security. In certain cases where market information is not available for a specific security but is available for similar securities, that security is valued using market information for similar securities, which is also a market approach. When market information is not available for a specific security (or similar securities) or is available but such information is less relevant or reliable, an income approach or a combination of a market and income approach is utilized. For securities with optionality, such as call or prepayment features (including asset-backed securities), an income or combination approach may be used. These valuation techniques may change from period to period, based on the relevance and availability of market data.

Further, while we consider the valuations provided by pricing services and broker quotes to be of high quality, management determines the fair value of our investment securities after considering all relevant and available information.
In general, we first obtain valuations from pricing services. If prices are unavailable for public securities, we obtain broker quotes. For all securities, excluding certain private fixed maturity securities, if neither a pricing service nor broker quotes valuation is available, we determine fair value using internal models. For certain private fixed maturity securities where we do not obtain valuations from pricing services, we utilize an internal model to determine fair value since transactions for similar securities are not readily observable and these securities are not typically valued by pricing services. 
Given our understanding of the pricing methodologies and procedures of pricing services, the securities valued by pricing services are typically classified as Level 2 unless we determine the valuation process for a security or group of securities utilizes significant unobservable inputs, which would result in the valuation being classified as Level 3. 
Broker quotes are typically based on an income approach given the lack of available market data. As the valuation typically includes significant unobservable inputs, we classify the securities where fair value is based on our consideration of broker quotes as Level 3 measurements.
For private fixed maturity securities, we utilize an income approach where we obtain public bond spreads and utilize those in an internal model to determine fair value. Other inputs to the model include rating and weighted-average life, as well as sector which is used to assign the spread. We then add an additional premium, which represents an unobservable input, to the public bond spread to adjust for the liquidity and other features of our private placements. We utilize the estimated market yield to discount the expected cash flows of the security to determine fair value. We utilize price caps for securities where the estimated market yield results in a valuation that may exceed the amount that would be received in a market transaction. When a security does not have an external rating, we assign the security an internal rating to determine the appropriate public bond spread that should be utilized in the valuation. While we generally consider the public bond spreads by sector and maturity to be observable inputs, we evaluate the similarities of our private placement with the public bonds, any price caps utilized, liquidity premiums applied, and whether external ratings are available for our private placements to determine whether the spreads utilized would be considered observable inputs, leading to a classification of Level 2. We classify private securities without an external rating or public bond spread as Level 3. In general, a significant increase (decrease) in credit spreads would have resulted in a significant decrease (increase) in the fair value for our fixed maturity securities as of December 31, 2024. 
For remaining securities priced using internal models, we determine fair value using an income approach. We maximize the use of observable inputs but typically utilize significant unobservable inputs to determine fair value. Accordingly, the valuations are typically classified as Level 3. 
Our assessment of whether or not there were significant unobservable inputs related to fixed maturity securities was based on our observations obtained through the course of managing our investment portfolio, including interaction with other market participants, observations related to the availability and consistency of pricing and/or rating, and understanding of general market activity such as new issuance and the level of secondary market trading for a class of securities. Additionally, we considered data obtained from pricing services to determine whether our estimated values incorporate significant unobservable inputs that would result in the valuation being classified as Level 3.
A summary of the inputs used for our fixed maturity securities and short-term investments based on the level in which instruments are classified is included below. We have combined certain classes of instruments together as the nature of the inputs is similar.

Level 2 measurements
Fixed maturity securities:
Third-party pricing services 
In estimating the fair value of fixed maturity securities, approximately 
91
% of our portfolio was priced using third-party pricing services as of December 31, 2024. These pricing services utilize industry-standard valuation techniques that include market-based approaches, income-based approaches, a combination of market-based and income-based approaches or other proprietary, internally generated models as part of the valuation processes. These third-party pricing vendors maximize the use of publicly available data inputs to generate valuations for each asset class. Priority and type of inputs used may change frequently as certain inputs may be more direct drivers of valuation at the time of pricing. Examples of significant inputs incorporated by pricing services may include sector and issuer spreads, seasoning, capital structure, security optionality, collateral data, prepayment assumptions, default assumptions, delinquencies, debt covenants, benchmark yields, trade data, dealer quotes, credit ratings, maturity and weighted-average life. We conduct regular meetings with our pricing services for the purpose of understanding the methodologies, techniques and inputs used by the third-party pricing providers. 
The following table presents a summary of the significant inputs used by our pricing services for certain fair value measurements of fixed maturity securities that are classified as Level 2 as of December 31, 2024:

180.8
 million and $
63.6
 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2024. Internally modeled securities are primarily private fixed maturity securities where we use market observable inputs such as an interest rate yield curve, published credit spreads for similar securities based on the external ratings of the instrument and related industry sector of the issuer. Additionally, we may apply certain price caps and liquidity premiums in the valuation of private fixed maturity securities. Price caps and liquidity premiums are established using inputs from market participants.
Short-term investments:
The fair value of short-term investments classified as Level 2 is determined after considering prices obtained by pricing services.
Level 3 measurements
Broker quotes 
A portion of our non-U.S. corporate and other asset-backed securities are valued using broker quotes. Broker quotes are obtained from third-party providers that have current market knowledge to provide a reasonable price for securities not routinely priced by pricing services. Brokers utilized for valuation of assets are reviewed annually. The fair value of our Level 3 fixed maturity securities priced by broker quotes was $
12.5
 million as of December 31, 2024. 
Internal models 
A portion of our U.S. corporate and non-U.S. corporate securities are valued using internal models. The primary inputs to the valuation of the bond population include quoted prices for identical assets, or similar assets in markets that are not active, contractual cash flows, duration, call provisions, issuer rating, benchmark yields and credit spreads. Certain private fixed maturity securities are valued using an internal model using market observable inputs such as the interest rate yield curve, as well as published credit spreads for similar securities, which includes significant unobservable inputs. Additionally, we may apply certain price caps and liquidity premiums in the valuation of private fixed maturity securities. Price caps are established using inputs from market participants. For structured securities, the primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for identical assets, or similar assets in markets that are not active, contractual cash flows, weighted-average coupon, weighted-average maturity, issuer rating, structure of the security, expected prepayment speeds and volumes, collateral type, current and forecasted loss severity, average delinquency rates, vintage of the loans, geographic region, debt service coverage

The transfers into and out of Level 3 for fixed maturity securities were related to changes in the primary pricing source and changes in the observability of external information used in determining the fair value, such as external ratings or credit spreads. 
Purchases, sales and settlements represent the activity that occurred during the period that results in a change of the asset but does not represent changes in fair value for the instruments held at the beginning of the period. 
The amount presented for realized and unrealized gains (losses) included in net income for fixed maturity securities primarily represents amortization and accretion of premiums and discounts on certain fixed maturity securities recorded within net investment income.

Losses and LAE incurred related to our domestic mortgage insurance.

The liability for loss reserves represents our current best estimate; however, there may be future adjustments to this estimate and related assumptions. Such adjustments, reflecting any variety of new and adverse trends, could be significant and result in future increases to reserves by amounts that could be material to our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
Losses incurred related to insured events of the current accident year relate to defaults that occurred in that year and represent the estimated ultimate amount of losses to be paid on such defaults. Losses incurred related to insured events of prior accident years represent the (favorable) or unfavorable development of reserves as a result of actual claim rates and claim amounts being different than those we estimated when originally establishing the reserves. Such estimates are based on our historical experience which we believe is representative of expected future losses at the time of estimation. As a result of the extended period of time that may exist between the reporting of a delinquency and the claim payment, as well as changes in economic conditions and the real estate market, significant uncertainty and variability exist on amounts ultimately paid. 
We recorded losses and LAE incurred of $
289.5
 million, $
275.4
 million and $
219.5
 million related to the current accident year for the years ended December 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Losses related to insured events of the current accident year in all periods presented were primarily attributable to new delinquencies. Losses in 2022 were also impacted by $
46
 million of reserve strengthening on current year delinquencies. A portion of delinquencies in the periods presented were from borrowers participating in deferred or reduced payments (“forbearance”) as a result of COVID-19. When establishing loss reserves for borrowers in forbearance from 2020 to 2022, we assumed a lower rate of delinquencies becoming active claims, which had the effect of producing a lower reserve compared to delinquencies that were not in forbearance. Historical experience with localized natural disasters, such as hurricanes, indicates a higher cure rate for borrowers in forbearance. Loss reserves recorded on these new delinquencies had a high degree of estimation due to the level of uncertainty regarding whether delinquencies in forbearance would ultimately cure or result in claim payments as well as the timing and severity of those payments.
During 2024, we experienced favorable reserve development of $
258
 million in incurred losses primarily on prior accident year reserves, as a result of strong cure performance and loss mitigation

Years Ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
efforts. The change was primarily attributable to $
252
 million in favorable reserve adjustments, which almost exclusively related to prior periods.
During 2023, we experienced favorable reserve development of $
248
 million primarily driven by cure performance of delinquencies from 2022 and earlier, including those related to COVID-19 as well as delinquencies from early 2022. The change was primarily attributable to $
241
 million in favorable reserve adjustments, which almost exclusively related to prior periods.
During 2022, we experienced favorable reserve development of $
314
 million in incurred losses attributable to prior years, primarily from better-than-expected cure performance on COVID-19 delinquencies from 2020 and 2021. The change was almost exclusively attributable to $
314
 million in favorable reserve adjustments.
The following table sets forth information about incurred claims, as well as cumulative number of reported delinquencies and the total of incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) liabilities plus expected development on reported claims included within the net incurred claims as of December 31, 2024.

Reinsurance 
We reinsure a portion of our policy risks to third parties in order to reduce our ultimate losses, diversify our exposures and comply with regulatory requirements. We also assume certain policy risks written by other companies. 
Reinsurance does not relieve us from our obligations to policyholders. In the event that the reinsurers are unable to meet their obligations, we remain liable for the reinsured claims. We monitor both the financial condition of individual reinsurers and risk concentrations arising from similar geographic regions, activities and economic characteristics of reinsurers to lessen the risk of default by such reinsurers.

We engage in excess-of-loss (“XOL”) insurance transactions either through a panel of traditional reinsurance providers or through collateralized reinsurance with unaffiliated special purpose insurers (“Triangle Re Entities”). During the respective coverage periods of these agreements, EMICO retains the first layer of aggregate loss exposure on covered policies while the reinsurer provides the second layer of coverage, up to the defined reinsurance coverage amount. EMICO retains losses in excess of the respective reinsurance coverage amount.
The Triangle Re Entities fully collateralize their coverage by issuing insurance-linked notes (“ILNs”) to eligible capital market investors in unregistered private offerings. Traditional reinsurance providers collateralize a portion of their coverage by holding funds in trust. We believe that the risk transfer requirements for reinsurance accounting were met as these XOL insurance transactions assume significant insurance risk and a reasonable possibility of significant loss.
EMICO has rights to terminate the ILNs or traditional XOL reinsurance agreements upon the occurrence of certain events.

Quota Share Reinsurance
EMICO engages in quota share reinsurance agreements with a panel of third-party reinsurers. Under the agreements, we cede a percentage of premiums earned, claims and claims expenses on eligible policies. The agreements also include a specific ceding commission and a profit commission determined based on ceded claims. 
EMICO has rights to terminate the reinsurance agreements upon the occurrence of certain events. Reinsurance recoverables are recorded in Other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.

Borrowings
In May 2024, we issued $
750
 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2029 (the “2029 Notes”). The 2029 Notes are the Company’s unsecured senior obligations. The 2029 Notes pay interest

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Years Ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
semi-annually on May 28 and November 28 at a rate of 
6.25
% per year, beginning on November 28, 2024, and will mature on May 28, 2029. 
At any time, or from time to time, prior to April 28, 2029 (the “Par Call Date”), the Company may redeem the 2029 Notes in whole or in part, at its option, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the redemption date (assuming the 2029 Notes matured on the Par Call Date) on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate plus 
30
 basis points less interest accrued to the redemption date, and (ii) 
100
% of the principal amount of the 2029 Notes to be redeemed, plus, in either case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date. At any time on or after the Par Call Date, the Company may redeem the 2029 Notes in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, at a redemption price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the 2029 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date.
The 2029 Notes contain customary events of default which, subject to certain notice and cure conditions, can result in the acceleration of the principal and accrued interest on the outstanding notes if we breach the terms of the indenture.

Redemption of Senior Notes due 2025
In June 2024, we exercised our right to redeem all $
750
 million of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 
6.5
% senior notes due 2025 (“2025 Notes”) at a price of 
101
% of the principal amount. We funded the redemption primarily through the proceeds of the 2029 Notes. The redemption resulted in a loss on debt extinguishment of $
10.9
 million.  
Revolving Credit Agreement
On June 30, 2022, we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders that provides for a 
five-year
, unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Facility”) in the initial aggregate principal amount of $
200
 million, including the ability for EHI to increase the commitments under the Facility, on an uncommitted basis, by an additional aggregate principal amount of up to $
100
 million. Borrowings under the Facility will accrue interest at a floating rate tied to a standard short-term borrowing index, selected at EHI’s option, plus an applicable margin. The applicable margins are based on the ratings established by certain debt rating agencies for EHI’s senior unsecured debt. The Facility matures in June 2027, but under certain conditions EHI may need to repay any outstanding amounts and terminate the Facility earlier than the maturity date.
We may use borrowings under the Facility for working capital needs and general corporate purposes, including the execution of dividends to our shareholders and capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries. The Facility contains several covenants, including financial covenants relating to minimum net worth, capital and liquidity levels, maximum debt to capitalization level and PMIERs compliance. We are in compliance with all covenants of the Facility and the Facility has remained undrawn through December 31, 2024.

As of December 31, 2024, the capital loss carryforward was $
24.5
 million and, if unused, will expire in 2028. There were 
no
 U.S. federal NOL carryforwards. 
Our valuation allowance as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $
18.0
 million and $
7.8
 million, respectively. Given the change in our unrealized gains (losses) on our fixed maturity securities for the Company and consolidated tax group in 2024 due to rising interest rates and the corresponding reduction in the amount of unrealized capital gains expected to be available in the future to offset our capital loss carryforwards and other capital deferred tax assets, we recorded a valuation allowance of $
10
 million during 2024 through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to deferred tax assets that would produce capital losses. The remainder of the valuation allowance as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 is related to state deferred tax assets. The state deferred tax assets related primarily to the future deductions associated with non-insurance and insurance net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards. 
Except as discussed above, we have not established a valuation allowance with respect to any other deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2024, based primarily upon projections of future taxable income. With respect to deferred tax assets associated with unrealized losses on investment securities, management has the ability and intent to execute tax planning strategies, including to hold those investment assets to recovery or maturity. We have determined that such strategies are prudent and feasible, and would be implemented, if necessary, to ensure recognition of the deferred tax asset. After consideration of all available evidence, we concluded that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized. If our actual results do not validate the current projections of pre-tax income, we may be required to record an additional valuation allowance which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in future periods. 
There were 
no
 unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. 
We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as components of the provision for income taxes. We have recorded $
0
 of benefits related to interest and penalties for 2024, 2023 and 2022. 
As previously discussed, we have elected to participate in the Genworth consolidated return. All Genworth companies domesticated in the United States are included in the Genworth consolidated return 
130
ENACT HOLDINGS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Years Ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
as allowed by the tax law and regulations. We have a tax sharing agreement in place and all intercompany balances related to this agreement are settled at least annually. We are not currently subject to any significant examinations by federal or state income tax authorities. Generally, we are no longer subject to federal or state income tax examinations for years prior to 2021. 
We are part of the 2022 Amended and Restated Tax Allocation Agreement (“TAA”) between Genworth and certain of our subsidiaries. The TAA was approved by state insurance regulators and our Board of Directors. The tax allocation methodology is based on the separate return liabilities with offsets for losses and credits utilized to reduce the current consolidated tax liability as allowed by applicable law and regulation. Our policy is to settle intercompany tax balances quarterly, with a final settlement after filing of Genworth’s federal consolidated U.S. corporate income tax return. 
Additionally, Enact Mortgage Insurance Corporation, Enact Residential Insurance Corporation, Enact Mortgage Insurance Corporation of North Carolina and Enact Financial Assurance Corporation (collectively, the “MI Group”), were parties to a supplemental tax sharing agreement that allowed them to accelerate the utilization of benefits as if they filed a stand-alone MI Group federal income tax return, even if those benefits had not been utilized in the consolidated federal return (“deemed used losses”). If any deemed used losses are subsequently actually used in a consolidated return, the members of the MI Group which received the benefit for such deemed used losses would not receive a second benefit for such losses. Also, if any member of the MI Group received benefit for any deemed used losses and leaves the consolidated group before such deemed used losses are actually used in a consolidated return, such member will repay such benefit received. Any benefits generated by the MI Group after January 1, 2021 will follow the TAA mentioned above, which does not allow for an acceleration when utilizing benefits.
The TAA prevents any allocation of tax to a separate company that is greater than the tax incurred on a separate company basis, subject to consolidated loss carry-forward adjustments. The total tax refund allocated to the MI Group, therefore, may exceed the consolidated tax refund received. 
Separate Return Method 
If during the year ended December 31, 2024, we had computed taxes using the separate return method, the unaudited pro forma provision for income taxes would increase by $
5
 million due to capital losses with respect to which a valuation allowance would be established on a separate return basis. If during the years ending December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had computed taxes using the separate return method, the unaudited pro forma provision for income taxes would remain unchanged.

Employee benefits
As a consolidated company within Genworth, our employees are generally provided a number of Genworth employee benefits. Genworth, as sponsor of the plans described below (collectively, “Shared Plans”), is ultimately responsible for maintenance of these plans in compliance with applicable laws. Our obligation results from an allocation of our share of expenses from Genworth’s plans based on benefits eligible earnings. Benefits eligible earnings include base pay, overtime, annual incentives and sales commissions. 
We account for such Shared Plans as multiemployer benefit plans. Accordingly, we do not record an asset or liability to recognize the funded status of the Shared Plans. We recognize a liability only for any required contributions to the Shared Plans that are accrued and unpaid at the balance sheet date, which is included within other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. 
Pension and Retiree Health and Life Insurance Benefit Plans 
Most of our employees are enrolled in a qualified defined contribution pension plan sponsored by Genworth. The plan is 
100
% funded by Genworth. Genworth makes annual contributions to each employee’s pension plan account based on the employee’s age, service and eligible pay. Employees are

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 of service. Expenses associated with the qualified defined contribution pension plan were $
2.0
 million, $
2.2
 million, and $
2.1
 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
In addition, certain employees also participate in non-qualified defined contribution plans and qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans sponsored by Genworth. Expenses associated with non-qualified defined contribution plans were $
1.5
 million, $
1.4
 million and $
1.2
 million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Expenses allocated to us for qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans were $
0.3
 million, for each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.
Genworth provides retiree health benefits to our employees hired prior to January 1, 2005, who meet certain service requirements. Under this plan, retirees over 65 years of age receive a subsidy towards the purchase of a Medigap policy, and retirees under 65 years of age receive medical benefits similar to our employees’ medical benefits. In December 2009, Genworth announced that eligibility for retiree medical benefits will be limited to associates who were within 10 years of retirement eligibility as of January 1, 2010. Genworth also provides retiree life and long-term care insurance benefits. Expenses allocated to us for retiree health and life insurance benefits plans were $
0.5
 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. 
Savings Plans 
Our employees participate in qualified and non-qualified defined contribution savings plans that allow employees to contribute a portion of their pay to the plan on a pre-tax basis. Genworth makes matching contributions equal to 
100
% of the first 
4
% of pay deferred by an employee and 
50
% of the next 
2
% of pay deferred by an employee so that our matching contribution does not exceed 
5
% of an employee’s pay. Employees do not vest immediately in Genworth matching contributions but fully vest in the matching contributions after 
two
 complete years of service. One option available to employees in the defined contribution savings plan is the ClearCourse
®
 variable annuity option offered by certain of Genworth’s life insurance subsidiaries.
Our cost associated with these plans was $
3.3
 million, $
3.3

Share-based compensation 
EHI share-based compensation
Beginning with our initial public offering in 2021, we offer share-based awards to employees and directors including restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units (“PSUs”) for employees and deferred stock units (“DSUs”) to directors. In 2021, the Enact Holdings, Inc. 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2021 Omnibus Plan”) was adopted and approved by EHI’s stockholders. Under the 2021 Omnibus incentive Plan, EHI was authorized to grant a maximum number of shares of Common Stock for issuance not to exceed 
4
 million shares.
Share-based compensation expense under the 2021 Omnibus Plan was $
18.8
 million, $
15.3
 million, $
9.9
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and is recorded within acquisition and operating expenses, net of deferrals in the consolidated statements of income. Stock-based compensation expense was recognized evenly on a straight-line attribution method over the awards’ respective vesting period.

During 2024, 2023, and 2022 the Company issued RSUs to our employees with average restriction periods of 
three years
 and a weighted average fair value of $
27.64
, $
24.26
, and $
22.18
, respectively. Each grant was measured at the fair value of a share of the Company’s Common Stock on the grant date.
The PSUs granted in 2024, 2023 and 2022 have a 
three-year
 measurement period starting on January 1, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, going through December 31, 2026, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The performance metrics are based on Enact’s consolidated book value per share growth at the end of the performance period, calculated as the increase in book value divided by the average number of shares outstanding during the measurement period. The PSUs were granted at fair value as of the approval date by Enact Holdings’ Board of Directors.
In connection with cash dividends paid in 2024, 2023 and 2022, dividend equivalent shares were issued to RSU, PSU and DSU holders as of the dividend date. The declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors.

Genworth share-based compensation 
Prior to May 2012, share-based awards were granted to employees and directors, including stock options, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) and RSUs under the 2004 Genworth Financial, Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2004 Omnibus Incentive Plan”). In May 2012, the 2012 Genworth Financial, Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2012 Omnibus Incentive Plan”) was approved by Genworth’s stockholders.

ENACT HOLDINGS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Years Ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
Under the 2012 Omnibus Incentive Plan, Genworth was authorized to grant 
16
 million equity awards, plus a number of additional shares not to exceed 
25
 million underlying awards outstanding under the 2004 Omnibus Incentive Plan. In December 2018, the 2018 Genworth Financial, Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan”) was approved by Genworth’s stockholders. Under the 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan, Genworth is authorized to grant 
25
 million equity awards, plus a number of additional shares not to exceed 
20
 million underlying awards outstanding under the prior Plans. The 2004 Omnibus Incentive Plan together with the 2012 Omnibus Incentive Plan and the 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan are referred to collectively as the “Omnibus Incentive Plans.” 
Share-based compensation expense under the Omnibus Incentive Plans was $
0.5
 million, $
2.6
 million and $
3.9
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and was included within acquisition and operating expenses, net of deferrals in the consolidated statements of income. For awards issued prior to January 1, 2006, share-based compensation expense was recognized on a graded vesting attribution method over the awards’ respective vesting schedule. For awards issued after January 1, 2006, share-based compensation expense was recognized evenly on a straight-line attribution method over the awards’ respective vesting period. 
For all PSU awards granted, the compensation committee of Genworth’s Board of Directors determines and approves no later than March 15, following the end of the 
three-year
 performance period for each applicable performance period, the number of units earned and vested for each distinct performance period.
Expense associated with our PSUs was less than $
1.0
 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022.
Genworth has time-based cash awards, which vest over 
three years
, with a third of the payout occurring per year as determined by the vesting period, beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date.

Litigation and Regulatory Matters
We face the risk of litigation and regulatory investigations and actions in the ordinary course of operating our business and are also subject to litigation arising out of our general business activities, such as our contractual and employment relationships. Past legal and regulatory actions include proceedings specific to us and others generally applicable to business practices in the mortgage insurance industry in which we operate. We have been, or may become, subject to lawsuits or regulatory investigations alleging, among other things, issues relating to violations of the Real Estate Settlement and Procedures Act of 1974 (“RESPA”) or related state anti-inducement laws, mortgage insurance policy rescissions and curtailments, pricing structures and general business practices, and breaching duties related to the privacy and information security of customer information. Plaintiffs in lawsuits against us may seek very large or indeterminate amounts which may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. In addition, we are also subject to various regulatory inquiries, such as information requests, subpoenas, books and record examinations and market conduct and financial examinations from state and federal regulators and other authorities. A substantial legal liability or a significant regulatory action against us could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, even if we ultimately prevail in the litigation, regulatory action or investigation, we could suffer significant reputational harm, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Statutory information 
Statutory Accounting Principles 
We prepare our statutory financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices required or permitted, if applicable, by the insurance departments of the respective states of domicile of our insurance subsidiaries. These statements of statutory accounting principles (“SSAP”) are established by a variety of National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") publications, as well as state laws, regulations and general administrative rules. In addition, insurance departments have the right to permit other specific practices that may deviate from prescribed practices. As of December 31, 2024, we did not have any prescribed or permitted statutory accounting practices that resulted in reported statutory surplus or risk-to-capital ratios being different from what would have been reported had NAIC statutory accounting practices been followed.
The key areas where SSAP financial statements differ from financial statements presented on a U.S. GAAP basis include:
(a)
Under SSAP, mortgage insurance companies are required each year to establish a special contingency reserve in their statutory financial statements to provide for losses in the event of significant economic declines. Annual additions to the statutory contingency reserve must be at least 50% of net earned premiums earned in such year. Such amount must be maintained in the contingency reserve for 10 years, after which time it is released to unassigned surplus. Prior to 10 years, the contingency reserve may be reduced with regulatory approval to the extent that losses in any calendar year exceed 35% of earned premiums for such year. 
(b)
Under SSAP, insurance policy acquisition costs are charged against operations in the year incurred. Under U.S. GAAP, such costs are deferred and amortized. 
(c)
Under SSAP, income tax expense is calculated on the basis of amounts currently payable. Generally, deferred tax assets are recognized under both SSAP and U.S. GAAP when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, SSAP standards impose additional admissibility requirements whereby deferred tax assets are only recognized to the extent they are expected to be recovered within a one- to three-year period subject to a capital and surplus limitation. Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized as a direct benefit or charge to unassigned surplus, whereas under U.S. GAAP changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities, except for changes in unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, are recorded as a component of income tax expense. 
(d)
Under SSAP, most of our fixed maturity investments are recorded at amortized cost while securities with certain NAIC designations are carried at the lower of amortized cost or market value. Under U.S. GAAP, our fixed maturity securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value, with the unrealized gain or loss recognized, net of tax, as an increase or decrease to accumulated other comprehensive income.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Years Ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
(e)
Under SSAP, certain assets, designated as non-admitted assets, are charged directly against statutory surplus. Such assets are reflected in our U.S. GAAP financial statements.

Statutory Capital Requirements 
Mortgage insurers are not subject to the NAIC’s risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements, but certain states and other regulators impose another form of capital requirement on mortgage insurers requiring maintenance of a risk-to-capital ratio not to exceed 25:1. Our mortgage insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in North Carolina. Fifteen other states maintain similar risk-to-capital requirements. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the risk-to-capital ratio for our combined mortgage insurance subsidiaries under the current regulatory framework as established under North Carolina law and enforced by the North Carolina Department of Insurance (“NCDOI”) was approximately 
10.5
:1 and 
11.6
:1, respectively. Each of our mortgage insurance subsidiaries met its respective capital requirement as of 2024 and 2023. 
PMIERs Regulatory Requirements 
Mortgage insurers must meet the private mortgage insurer eligibility requirements (“PMIERs”) as set forth by each GSE in order to remain eligible to insure loans that are purchased by the GSEs. Each approved mortgage insurer is required to provide the GSEs with an annual certification and a quarterly report as to its compliance with PMIERs. 
Since its adoption in 2015, PMIERs has been amended on several occasions, including as a result of COVID-19 (as amended, the “PMIERs Amendment”).
The PMIERs include financial requirements for mortgage insurers under which a mortgage insurer’s “Available Assets” (generally only the most liquid assets of an insurer) must meet or exceed “Minimum Required Assets” (which are based on an insurer’s risk-in-force (“RIF”) and are calculated from tables of factors with several risk dimensions and are subject to a floor amount) and otherwise generally establish when a mortgage insurer is qualified to issue coverage that will be acceptable to the respective GSE for acquisition of high loan-to-value (“LTV”) mortgages. The GSEs may amend or waive PMIERs at their discretion, impose additional conditions or restrictions on us and also have broad discretion to interpret PMIERs, which could impact the calculation of our “Available Assets” and/or “Minimum Required Assets.” The amount of capital that EMICO may be required to maintain the “Minimum Required Assets” as defined in PMIERs, and operate our business is dependent upon, among other things: (i) the way PMIERs are applied and interpreted by the GSEs and the FHFA; (ii) future PMIERs amendments; (iii) the future performance of the housing market; (iv) our generation of earnings in our business, “Available Assets” and “Minimum Required Assets,” reducing RIF and reducing delinquencies as anticipated, and writing anticipated amounts and types of new mortgage insurance business; and (v) our overall financial performance, capital and liquidity levels. Depending on our actual experience, the amount of capital required under PMIERs may be higher than currently anticipated. In the absence of a premium increase for new business, if we hold more capital relative to insured loans, our returns will be lower. We may be unable to increase premium rates for various reasons, principally due to competition. Our inability to increase the capital as required in the anticipated timeframes and on the anticipated terms, and to realize the anticipated benefits, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. More particularly, our ability to continue to meet the PMIERs financial requirements and maintain a prudent amount of capital in excess of those requirements, given the dynamic nature of asset valuations and requirement changes over time, is dependent upon, among other things: (i) our 
140
ENACT HOLDINGS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Years Ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
ability to complete credit risk transfer (“CRT”) transactions on our anticipated terms and timetable, which, as applicable, are subject to market conditions, third-party approvals and other actions (including approval by the GSEs), and other factors that are outside of our control and (ii) our ability to contribute holding company cash or other sources of capital to satisfy the portion of the financial requirements that are not satisfied through these transactions.
The PMIERs Amendment implemented both permanent and temporary revisions to PMIERs. For loans that became non-performing due to a COVID-19 hardship, PMIERs was amended with respect to each non-performing loan that (i) had an initial missed monthly payment occurring on or after March 1, 2020 and prior to April 1, 2021 or (ii) is subject to a forbearance plan granted in response to a financial hardship related to COVID-19, the terms of which are materially consistent with terms of forbearance plans offered by the GSEs. The risk-based required asset amount factor for a non-performing loan is the greater of (a) the applicable risk-based required asset amount factor for a performing loan were it not delinquent, and (b) the product of a 
0.30
 multiplier and the applicable risk-based required asset amount factor for a non-performing loan. In the case of (i) above, absent the loan being subject to a forbearance plan described in (ii) above, the 
0.30
 multiplier will be applicable for no longer than three calendar months beginning with the month in which the loan became a non-performing loan due to having missed two monthly payments. Loans subject to a forbearance plan described in (ii) above include those that are either in a repayment plan or loan modification trial period following the forbearance plan unless reported to the approved insurer that the loan is no longer in such forbearance plan, repayment plan, or loan modification trial period. Per guidance released by the GSEs in the third quarter of 2024, use of the multiplier will be discontinued effective March 31, 2025.
Our assessment of PMIERs compliance is based on a number of factors, including our understanding of the GSEs’ interpretation of the PMIERs financial requirements. The GSEs require our mortgage insurance subsidiaries not to exceed a maximum statutory RTC ratio of 18:1 or they reserve the right to reevaluate the amount of PMIERs credit for reinsurance and other CRT transactions available under PMIERs indicated in their approval letters. Freddie Mac has also imposed additional requirements on our option to commute these reinsurance agreements. Both GSEs reserved the right to periodically review the reinsurance transactions for treatment under PMIERs. If we are unable to continue to meet the requirements mandated by PMIERs, or any additional restrictions which may be imposed on us by the GSEs, we may not be eligible to write new insurance on loans acquired by the GSEs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We have met all PMIERs reporting requirements as required by the GSEs. As of December 31, 2024, we had available assets of $
5,095
 million against $
3,043
 million net required assets under PMIERs, compared to available assets of $
5,006
 million against $
3,119
 million net required assets as of December 31, 2023. The sufficiency above the PMIERs financial requirements as of December 31, 2024, was $
2,052
 million, compared to $
1,887
 million above PMIERs requirements as of December 31, 2023, resulting in a PMIERs sufficiency ratio of 
167
% and 
161
% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
On August 21, 2024, the GSEs and the FHFA released updated PMIERs requirements phasing in a revision to the available assets standards between March 31, 2025 and September 30, 2026. The updated standards differentiate between bonds based on credit quality and liquidity. The updates also establish limits for assets backed by residential mortgages or commercial real estate to mitigate the impact if such assets lose value during periods of housing stress. We expect to hold capital sufficiency well in excess of these requirements and do not expect the impact of these updates to be material to our sufficiency. The ultimate impact of the PMIERs changes will be influenced by investment portfolio maturities, dispositions, reinvestments, and overall business and economic performance between today and the phase-in dates.

Dividend Restrictions 
The majority of our investments are held by our regulated U.S. mortgage insurance subsidiaries which may be limited in their ability to pay dividends or make distributions to a holding company in the future due to restrictions related to their capital levels. Our U.S. mortgage insurance subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital on a statutory basis, as well as pursuant to the PMIERs promulgated by the GSEs. Moreover, even where such dividends or distributions would not cause capital to fall below the minimum levels required by state insurance regulators and the GSEs, the ability of our regulated insurance operating subsidiaries to pay dividends and distributions to us is restricted by certain provisions of North Carolina insurance laws. Our insurance subsidiaries may pay dividends only from unassigned surplus; payments made from sources other than unassigned surplus, such as paid-in and contributed surplus, are categorized as distributions. Notice of all dividends must be submitted to the Commissioner of the NCDOI (the “Commissioner”) within 5 business days after declaration of the dividend, and at least 30 days before payment thereof. No dividend may be paid until 30 days after the Commissioner has received notice of the declaration thereof and (i) has not within that period disapproved the payment or (ii) has approved the payment within the 30-day period. Any distribution, regardless of amount, requires that same 30-day notice to the Commissioner, but also requires the Commissioner’s affirmative approval before being paid.
 Based on estimated statutory results as of December 31, 2024, in accordance with applicable dividend restrictions, our insurance subsidiaries could pay dividends of approximately $
153
 million from unassigned surplus in 2025 without obtaining prior regulatory approval, although notice of the intent to pay must be provided to the Commissioner 30 days in advance thereof during which period the Commissioner may review the dividend pursuant to statutory standards.

Earnings per share 
The basic earnings per share computation is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the calculation of dilutive weighted average shares considers the impact of restricted stock units and performance stock units issued to employees as well as deferred stock units issued to our directors.

Segment Reporting
We operate our business in a single reportable segment, Mortgage Insurance, which is how our CODM, who is our Chief Executive Officer, reviews our financial performance and allocates resources. We derive revenue primarily through writing and assuming residential mortgage guaranty insurance in the United States. We manage our single segment on a consolidated basis, and our reported measure of segment profit or loss is consolidated net income. 
 The CODM uses net income to evaluate income generated from segment assets in deciding how to reinvest profits into the core business, or into other parts of the entity, such as new business initiatives or

NOTES TO SCHEDULE II 
Years Ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
(1)
Organization and purpose
Enact Holdings, Inc. (“EHI,” together with its subsidiaries, the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) (formerly known as Genworth Mortgage Holdings, Inc.) was a wholly owned subsidiary of Genworth Financial, Inc. (“Genworth”) since EHI’s incorporation in Delaware in 2012. In September 2021, we completed a minority initial public offering (“IPO”) of 18.4% of EHI’s common stock. 
(2)
Summary of significant accounting policies
The accompanying EHI financial statements have been prepared on the same basis and using the same accounting policies as described in the consolidated financial statements included herein. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto. 
EHI includes equity in the income of subsidiaries in its statements of income, which represents the net income of each of its consolidated subsidiaries. 
(3)
Borrowings
In May 2024, we issued $
750
 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2029 (the “2029 Notes”). The 2029 Notes are the Company’s unsecured senior obligations. The 2029 Notes pay interest semi-annually on May 28 and November 28 at a rate of 
6.25
% per year, beginning on November 28, 2024, and will mature on May 28, 2029. 
At any time, or from time to time, prior to April 28, 2029 (the “Par Call Date”), the Company may redeem the 2029 Notes in whole or in part, at its option, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the redemption date (assuming the 2029 Notes matured on the Par Call Date) on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate plus 
30
 basis points less interest accrued to the redemption date, and (ii) 
100
% of the principal amount of the 2029 Notes to be redeemed, plus, in either case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date. At any time on or after the Par Call Date, the Company may redeem the 2029 Notes in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, at a redemption price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the 2029 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date.
The 2029 Notes contain customary events of default which, subject to certain notice and cure conditions, can result in the acceleration of the principal and accrued interest on the outstanding notes if we breach the terms of the indenture.

Redemption of Senior Notes due 2025
In June 2024, we exercised our right to redeem all $
750
 million of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 
6.5
% senior notes due 2025 (“2025 Notes”) at a price of 
101
% of the principal amount. We 
149
SCHEDULE II 
ENACT HOLDINGS, INC.
(PARENT COMPANY ONLY)
funded the redemption primarily through the proceeds of the 2029 Notes. The redemption resulted in a loss on debt extinguishment of $
10.9
 million.  
Revolving Credit Agreement
On June 30, 2022, we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders that provides for a five-year, unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Facility”) in the initial aggregate principal amount of $
200
 million, including the ability for EHI to increase the commitments under the Facility, on an uncommitted basis, by an additional aggregate principal amount of up to $
100
 million. Borrowings under the Facility will accrue interest at a floating rate tied to a standard short-term borrowing index, selected at EHI’s option, plus an applicable margin. The applicable margins are based on the ratings established by certain debt rating agencies for EHI’s senior unsecured debt. The Facility matures in June 2027, but under certain conditions EHI may need to repay any outstanding amounts and terminate the Facility earlier than the maturity date.
We may use borrowings under the Facility for working capital needs and general corporate purposes, including the execution of dividends to our shareholders and capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries. The Facility contains several covenants, including financial covenants relating to minimum net worth, capital and liquidity levels, maximum debt to capitalization level and PMIERs compliance. We are in compliance with all covenants of the Facility and the Facility has remained undrawn through December 31, 2024.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of December 31, 2024, an evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2024.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
With the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.
Our independent auditor, KPMG LLP, a registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting which appears below.
Changes in Internal Control
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management’s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors 
Enact Holdings, Inc.:
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Enact Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedules I to II (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 28, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
152
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
