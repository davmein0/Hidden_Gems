 * Contribution ex-TAC and Adjusted EBITDA are Non-GAAP measures. Refer to discussion in section "Key Operating and Financial Performance Metrics" for a definition of Contribution ex-TAC and Adjusted EBITDA, as well as reconciliations of gross profit to Contribution ex-TAC and Net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
Over the past several years, we have made a number of investments to build what we believe is the leading independent programmatic CTV platform, including our 2021 acquisitions of SpotX, a leading CTV supply side platform, and SpringServe, a leading ad server for CTV. We believe these transactions are highly strategic, as the combination of our SSP and ad server allows us to offer publishers an independent full-stack solution that works across their entire video advertising business, for both programmatic and directly sold inventory, to manage yield and drive value. As a result of our investments, CTV has become the biggest growth driver of our business, with revenue growing 13% and Contribution ex-TAC growing 19% year over year from 2023 to 2024.
We believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of a number of favorable market trends in CTV. In particular, as the pace of consumer adoption has accelerated and the streaming market has proliferated, the largest streaming publishers have adopted ad-supported models leading to a significant increase in the amount of CTV inventory available for advertisers. 
Despite the proliferation of CTV advertising inventory, CTV sellers have been slower to embrace biddable environments with multiple buyers compared to desktop and mobile sellers. Currently, the vast majority of CTV advertising is transacted through reserve auctions that are established by a sellers direct sales team with a single buyer. This is particularly true of larger publishers and broadcasters that are newer to programmatic advertising and have large direct sales forces, as reserve auctions allow the seller to maintain tighter control over their advertising allocation. These publishers have continued to increase their focus and investment in programmatic CTV, and in recent periods have grown as a percentage of our CTV business.
As the industry matures, we anticipate that market dynamics will lead CTV sellers to make a greater percentage of inventory available through biddable auction environments in order to attract a broader set of advertisers that have not historically advertised on linear TV. We believe that this shift, if it were to occur, would likely be beneficial to our CTV growth as biddable transactions tend to require a higher level of service and therefore carry a higher take-rate compared to reserve auctions. At the same time, we expect CTV advertisers that have historically transacted on our platform through managed service insertion orders to continue to shift budgets towards more automated solutions, which tend to carry a lower take rate; and as a result, we expect transactions through managed service insertion orders to become a smaller component of our overall business.

In addition to CTV, we track mobile and desktop channels. We expect our revenue and Contribution ex-TAC from each of these channels to grow at a slower rate compared to CTV, with mobile expected to grow at a higher rate than desktop. As such, we expect our desktop business to continue to decline as an overall percentage of our revenue in future periods; however, we expect that it will continue to represent a significant percentage of our revenue in the near term. Therefore, the mix of our desktop business will continue to have a negative effect on our overall growth rate.
Our mobile channel consists of mobile web and mobile applications, with mobile applications expected to be a larger driver of our growth in future periods. A significant portion of the mobile application inventory on our platform is made available through third-party mobile technology platforms or aggregators, rather than application developers themselves. Accordingly, we are focused on expanding our relationships with these third parties in order to increase our access to inventory. Other important growth initiatives for our mobile and desktop channels include: bringing additional advertising demand to sellers through SPO and other buyer initiatives; increasing the operational efficiency of our platform to reduce costs for us as well as the process costs for buyers; developing alternative identity solutions to increase the value of seller inventory, as the industry shifts away from third-party cookies; and leveraging our machine learning and big data set to improve traffic shaping and generate higher-quality matching between buyers and sellers. 
Our results for the year-ended December 31, 2024, were negatively impacted by challenges in the fourth quarter in our desktop and mobile channels, where we experienced a significant drop in advertising demand following the election and through year-end. We believe this drop was temporary in nature and was likely due to fears of macro and political uncertainty due to the election.
We anticipate that our operating expenses will continue to increase in the foreseeable future as we invest in technology and development to enhance our product features, in particular CTV, as well as sales and marketing to acquire new clients and reinforce our relationships with existing clients. At the same time, we are making additional investments in on-prem data centers to support a higher percentage of CTV transactions, with the goal of increasing the operational efficiency of our platform in order to realize long-term cost savings.
Macroeconomic Developments
Macroeconomic challenges, such as inflation, the interest rate environment, global conflicts, the risk of a recession, and labor strikes, generally have a negative impact on ad budgets, which in turn may lead to slower ad spend growth through our platform. Any worsening of macroeconomic conditions in future periods would likely have a negative effect on our financial results, the magnitude of which is difficult to predict. In addition, continued inflation could result in an increase in our cost base relative to our revenue.
Refer to Item 1A. "Risk Factors" for additional information related to risks associated with macroeconomic challenges.
Components of Our Results of Operations 
We report our financial results as one operating segment. Our consolidated operating results are regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker, principally to make decisions about how we allocate our resources and to measure our consolidated operating performance. 
Revenue 
We generate revenue from the use of our platform for the purchase and sale of digital advertising inventory. Generally, our revenue is based on a percentage of the ad spend that runs through our platform, although for certain clients, services, or transaction types, we may receive a fixed CPM for each impression sold, and for advertising campaigns that are transacted through insertion orders, we earn revenue based on the full amount of ad spend that runs through our platform. In addition, we may receive certain fixed monthly fees for the use of our platform or products. We recognize revenue upon the fulfillment of our contractual obligations in connection with a completed transaction, subject to satisfying all other revenue recognition criteria. For the majority of transactions executed through our platform, we act as an agent on behalf of the publisher that is monetizing its inventory, and revenue is recognized net of any advertising inventory costs that we remit to sellers. With respect to certain revenue streams for managed advertising campaigns that are transacted through insertion orders, we report revenue on a gross basis, based primarily on our determination that the Company acts as the primary obligor in the delivery of advertising campaigns for our buyer clients with respect to such transactions. 
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, our revenue reported on a gross basis was 14%, 18%, and 18% of total revenue for the respective periods. Any mix shift that causes an increase in the relative percentage of our revenue accounted for on a gross basis would result in a higher revenue contribution and an associated decrease in our gross margin percentage (with no underlying impact on gross profit or Contribution ex-TAC, as defined in section "Key Operating and Financial Performance Metrics"). Our revenue recognition policies are discussed in more detail in Note 2 of the "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements."

Table of Contents
Expenses 
We classify our expenses into the following categories: 
Cost of Revenue
. Our cost of revenue primarily consists of cloud hosting, data center, and bandwidth costs, ad verification costs, depreciation and maintenance expense of hardware supporting our revenue-producing platform, amortization of internally-developed software costs for the development of our revenue-producing platform, amortization expense associated with acquired developed technologies, personnel costs, and software costs. In addition, for revenue booked on a gross basis, cost of revenue includes traffic acquisition costs. Personnel costs included in cost of revenue include salaries, bonuses, and stock-based compensation, and are primarily attributable to personnel in our network operations group who support our platform. We capitalize costs associated with software that is developed or obtained for internal use and amortize the costs associated with our revenue-producing platform in cost of revenue over their estimated useful lives. We amortize acquired developed technologies over their estimated useful lives.
Sales and Marketing
. Our sales and marketing expenses primarily consists of personnel costs, including salaries, bonuses, and stock-based compensation, as well as marketing expenses such as brand marketing, travel expenses, trade shows and marketing materials, amortization expense associated with client relationships, and non-compete agreements from our business acquisitions, professional services, facilities-related costs, and depreciation expense. Our sales and support organization focuses on increasing the adoption of our solution by existing and new buyers and sellers and supports ongoing client relationships. We amortize acquired intangibles associated with client relationships from our business acquisitions over their estimated useful lives.
Technology and Development
. Our technology and development expenses primarily consists of personnel costs, including salaries, bonuses, and stock-based compensation, as well as professional services associated with the ongoing development and maintenance of our solution, software costs, facilities-related costs, and depreciation and amortization expense. These expenses include costs incurred in the development, implementation, and maintenance of internal use software, including platform and related infrastructure. Technology and development costs are expensed as incurred, except to the extent that such costs are associated with internal use software development that qualifies for capitalization, which are then recorded as internal use software development costs, net, on our consolidated balance sheets. We amortize internal use software development costs that relate to our revenue-producing activities on our platform to cost of revenue and amortize other internal use software development costs to technology and development costs or general and administrative expenses, depending on the nature of the related project. We amortize acquired intangibles associated with technology and development functions from our business acquisitions over their estimated useful lives.
General and Administrative
. Our general and administrative expenses primarily consists of personnel costs, including salaries, bonuses, and stock-based compensation, associated with our executive, finance, legal, human resources, compliance, and other administrative personnel, as well as accounting and legal professional services fees, facilities-related costs, depreciation expense, bad debt expense, and other corporate-related expenses.
Merger, Acquisition, and Restructuring Costs.
 Our merger, acquisition, and restructuring costs primarily consists of professional service fees associated with merger and acquisition activities, cash-based employee termination costs, related stock-based compensation charges, and other restructuring activities, including facility closures, relocation costs, contract termination costs, and impairment costs of abandoned technology associated with restructuring activities.
Other (Income) Expense
Interest (Income) Expense, Net.
 Interest expense primarily consists of interest expense associated with our 2024 Term Loan B Facility (defined below), 2021 Term Loan B Facility (defined below) and Convertible Senior Notes (defined below), and their related amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount. Interest income primarily consists of interest earned on our cash equivalents.
Foreign Currency Exchange (Gain) Loss, Net
. Foreign currency exchange (gain) loss, net consists of gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities on our balance sheet denominated in foreign currencies. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities primarily consists of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and various intercompany balances held between our subsidiaries. Our primary foreign currency exposures are currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, principally the Australian Dollar, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Euro, Japanese Yen, and New Zealand Dollar. 
(Gain) Loss on Extinguishment of Debt
. Gain or loss on extinguishment of debt consists of gains or losses associated with the repurchases of Convertible Senior Notes at a discount or premium and gains or losses associated with the refinancing of our debt facilities, including the extinguishment of unamortized debt discount, debt issuance costs, and deferred financing costs.
Other Income. 
Other income primarily consists of rental income from commercial office space we hold under lease and have sublet to other tenants.
Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes 
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without

notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related income tax benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets ("DTAs") and liabilities and their valuation, changes in the laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions.

Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
Revenue
Revenue increased $48.5 million, or 8%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year. Our revenue growth was driven primarily by growth in CTV and mobile. Revenue from CTV, mobile, and desktop increased by $35.3 million, or 13%, $12.1 million, or 5%, and $1.0 million, or 1%, respectively.
Revenue increased $42.6 million, or 7%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year. Our revenue growth was driven primarily by growth in mobile and CTV, which was partially offset by a decrease in desktop. Revenue from mobile and CTV increased by $39.7 million, or 21%, and $13.6 million, or 5%, respectively, while desktop decreased by $10.6

Table of Contents
million, or 9%. During 2023, our growth rate in CTV was negatively impacted, in part, by a mix shift towards large CTV sellers that transacted primarily through reserve auctions, which carry a lower overall take rate compared to other transaction types.
Our revenue is largely a function of the number of advertising transactions and the price, or CPM, at which the inventory is sold, which results in total advertising spend on our platform, and, with respect to our revenue reported on a net basis, the take rate we charge for our services. Because pricing and take rate vary across publisher, channel, and transaction type, our revenue is subject to changes in publisher-specific take rates, and shifts in the mix of advertising spend on our platform among publishers and transaction types.
For 2025, we believe our revenue will increase compared to the prior year period and we expect CTV will continue to be our biggest growth driver. 
Cost of Revenue 
Cost of revenue decreased $151.1 million, or 37%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year, primarily due to decreases of $164.4 million in depreciation and amortization, which was primarily driven by certain acquired intangible assets becoming fully amortized in the third quarter of 2023. These decreases were partially offset by increases of $11.8 million in cloud hosting, data center, and bandwidth expenses, primarily due to revenue growth and an associated increase in the volume of transactions processed on our platform.
On January 1, 2024, we extended the 
estimated useful lives of our network hardware assets from three years to five years, which was due to actual and expected longer refresh cycles for these assets. Based on the related asset balance as of December 31, 2023 and those placed in service during the 
year ended December 31, 2024, 
the effect of this change reduced depreciation expense by 
$12.6 million
 for the full year ending December 31, 2024 when compared to what depreciation expense would have been based on the original expected useful lives of three years.
Cost of revenue increased 
$102.7 million
, or 33%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year, primarily due to increases of $69.3 million in depreciation and amortization. These increases were primarily driven by incremental amortization due to the acceleration of the remaining lives of certain acquired intangible assets and capitalized software from the integration of our legacy Magnite CTV and SpotX CTV platforms, which started in the fourth quarter of 2022 and was completed in the third quarter of 2023. The year over year increase in amortization due to the acceleration was $64.0 million. Cost of revenue also included increases of $26.2 million in cloud hosting, data center, and bandwidth expenses and $8.1 million in traffic acquisition costs, both primarily due to revenue growth and an associated increase in the volume of transactions processed on our platform.
Cost of revenue may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and period to period, on an absolute dollar basis and as a percentage of revenue, depending on revenue levels and the volume of transactions we process supporting those revenues, and the timing and amounts of depreciation and amortization of equipment and software. 
Sales and Marketing 
Sales and marketing expenses decreased $7.8 million, or 5%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year, primarily due to decreases of $17.4 million in depreciation and amortization, which were primarily driven by certain acquired intangible assets becoming fully amortized in 2023. These decreases were partially offset by increases of $9.5 million in personnel costs. 
Sales and marketing expenses decreased $26.1 million, or 13%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year, primarily due to decreases of $44.3 million in depreciation and amortization, which were primarily driven by certain acquired intangible assets becoming fully amortized in 2022 and 2023. These decreases were partially offset by increases of $15.3 million of personnel costs.
Sales and marketing expenses may fluctuate quarter to quarter and period to period, on an absolute dollar basis and as a percentage of revenue, based on revenue levels, the timing of our investments and seasonality in our industry and business.
Technology and Development 
Technology and development expenses increased $0.9 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year. 
Technology and development expenses increased $0.6 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year.
The timing and amount of our capitalized development and enhancement projects may affect the amount of development costs expensed in any given period. As a percentage of revenue, technology and development expense may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and period to period based on revenue levels, the timing and amounts of technology and development efforts, the timing and the rate of the amortization of internally-developed capitalized projects and the timing and amounts of future capitalized internally-developed software costs.
48
Table of Contents
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses increased $7.8 million, or 9%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year, primarily due to increases of $5.9 million in personnel costs, $4.1 million in expenses associated with refinancing our 2021 Credit Agreement (defined below) in February 2024 and repricing our 2024 Term Loan B Facility (defined below) in September 2024, and $3.7 million in insurance and business taxes. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $4.1 million in bad debt expense and $2.7 million in facilities-related costs. The higher bad debt expense in 2023 as compared to 2024 was primarily due to a buyer defaulting on payment obligations and filing for bankruptcy, resulting in bad debt expense of $4.2 million.
General and administrative expenses increased by $7.7 million, or 9%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year, primarily due to increases of $4.8 million in bad debt expense, as described above, and $4.2 million in personnel costs.
General and administrative expenses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and period to period based on the timing and amounts of expenditures in our general and administrative functions as they vary in scope and scale over periods. Such fluctuations may not be directly proportional to changes in revenue.
Merger, Acquisition, and Restructuring Costs
We did not incur any merger, acquisition, and restructuring costs for the year ended December 31, 2024. We incurred merger, acquisition, and restructuring costs of $7.5 million and $7.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, primarily related to the acquisitions of SpotX, Inc. and SpringServe, LLC, which were completed on April 30, 2021 and July 1, 2021, respectively.
In 2023, these costs primarily included $3.4 million of severance related expenses, $2.2 million of facilities related loss contracts, and $1.4 million of exit costs, all due to restructuring activities as a result of consolidating our legacy CTV and SpotX CTV platforms following the SpotX acquisition. 
In 2022, these costs primarily included $3.3 million of impairment costs associated with abandoned technology, $2.0 million non-cash stock-based compensation expense associated with the acceleration of unvested equity awards, and $1.2 million of one-time cash-based employee termination costs due to restructuring activities related to the integration of our acquisitions.

Interest expense, net decreased by $5.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year. The net decrease is primarily due to an increase in interest income and a decrease in interest expense as a result of lower Convertible Senior Notes (defined below) outstanding throughout 2024 as compared to the prior year period and the lower interest incurred under the 2024 Term Loan B Facility (defined below) compared to the 2021 Term Loan B Facility (defined below).
Interest expense, net increased by $3.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year, mainly due to increased interest expense of $11.3 million as a result of increased interest rates on our 2021 Term Loan B Facility (defined below), partially offset by an increase in interest income of $8.2 million. 
Foreign exchange (gain) loss, net changed by $7.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year, due to movements in foreign currency exchange rates and the amount of foreign currency-denominated cash, receivables, and payables, which were impacted by our billings to buyers, payments to sellers, and intercompany balances. Foreign exchange (gain) loss, net changed by $3.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year, for the same reasons above.
The loss on extinguishment of debt of $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 was due to the refinancing of our 2021 Credit Agreement (defined below) in February 2024 and the repricing of our 2024 Term Loan B Facility (defined below) in September 2024, which are further discussed below. The gain on extinguishment of debt of $26.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 was due to the repurchase of portions of our Convertible Senior Notes (defined below).
Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes
We recorded an income tax expense of $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to an income tax expense of $1.6 million and an income tax benefit $5.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The 
49
Table of Contents
income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily the result of our ability to recognize DTAs subject to the domestic valuation allowance and the state and foreign income tax provisions. We continue to maintain a valuation allowance for our domestic deferred tax assets.
The income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily the result of the domestic valuation allowance and the federal, state, and foreign income tax liabilities. 
The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily the result of recognizing the benefit of deferred tax assets previously subject to the domestic valuation allowance and the foreign income tax liability. The net deferred tax liabilities recorded in connection with prior acquisitions and current taxable income for the year provided sources of taxable income to support the realization of pre-existing deferred tax assets. 
Key Operating and Financial Performance Metrics
In addition to our GAAP results, we review non-GAAP financial measures, including Contribution ex-TAC and Adjusted EBITDA, to help us evaluate our business on a consistent basis, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of investments in our technology and development and sales and marketing, and assess our operational efficiencies. Our non-GAAP financial measures are discussed below. Revenue and net income (loss) are discussed above under the headings "Components of Our Results of Operations" and "Results of Operations." 
Contribution ex-TAC 
Contribution ex-TAC is calculated as gross profit plus cost of revenue excluding traffic acquisition cost ("TAC"). Traffic acquisition cost, a component of cost of revenue, represents what we must pay sellers for the sale of advertising inventory through our platform for revenue reported on a gross basis. Contribution ex-TAC is a non-GAAP financial measure that is most comparable to gross profit. Our management believes Contribution ex-TAC is a useful measure in facilitating a consistent comparison against our core business without considering the impact of traffic acquisition costs related to revenue reported on a gross basis. 
Our use of Contribution ex-TAC has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. A potential limitation of this non-GAAP financial measure is that other companies, including companies in our industry which have similar business arrangements, may define Contribution ex-TAC differently, which may make comparisons difficult. Because of these and other limitations, you should consider our non-GAAP measures only as supplemental to GAAP-based financial performance measures, including revenue, gross profit, net income (loss) and cash flows.
The following table presents the calculation of gross profit and reconciliation of gross profit to Contribution ex-TAC for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively:

Contribution ex-TAC increased $57.8 million, or 11%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in Contribution ex-TAC was primarily due to the growth drivers described above for revenue.
Contribution ex-TAC increased $34.5 million, or 7%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in Contribution ex-TAC was primarily due to the growth drivers described above for revenue.
For 2025, we expect Contribution ex-TAC will increase compared to the prior year period, and we expect CTV will be our biggest growth driver in 2025.
Adjusted EBITDA
We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, amortization of acquired intangible assets, impairment charges, interest income or expense, and other cash and non-cash based income or expenses that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance, including, but not limited to foreign exchange gains and losses, acquisition and related items, gains or losses on extinguishment of debt, other debt refinancing expenses, non-operational real estate and other expenses (income), net, and provision (benefit) for income taxes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating our performance for the following reasons:
•
Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company’s performance without regard to items such as those we exclude in calculating this measure, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon their financing, capital structures, and the method by which assets were acquired.
•
Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with GAAP financial measures for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of performance and the effectiveness of our business strategies, and in communications with our board of directors concerning our performance. Adjusted EBITDA is also used as a metric for determining payment of cash incentive compensation.
•
Adjusted EBITDA provides a measure of consistency and comparability with our past performance that many investors find useful, facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, and also facilitates comparisons with other peer companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results.
Although Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies, Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported under GAAP. These limitations include:
•
Stock-based compensation is a non-cash charge and will remain an element of our long-term incentive compensation package, although we exclude it as an expense when evaluating our ongoing operating performance for a particular period.
•
Depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, and the assets being depreciated or amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, but Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for these replacements.
•
Impairment charges are non-cash charges related to goodwill, intangible assets and/or long-lived assets.
•
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect certain cash and non-cash charges related to acquisition and related items, such as amortization of acquired intangible assets, merger, acquisition, or restructuring related severance costs, and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration.
•
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash and non-cash charges and changes in, or cash requirements for, acquisition and related items, such as certain transaction expenses.
•
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash and non-cash charges related to certain financing transactions such as gains or losses on extinguishment of debt or other debt refinancing expenses.
•
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect certain non-operational real estate and other (income) and expense, net, which consists of transactions or expenses that are typically by nature non-operating, one-time items, or unrelated to our core operations.
•
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in our working capital needs, capital expenditures, or contractual commitments.
•
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash requirements for income taxes and the cash impact of other income or expense.
•
Other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.

Table of Contents
Our Adjusted EBITDA is influenced by fluctuations in our revenue, cost of revenue, and the timing and amounts of the cost of our operations. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.
The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss), the most comparable GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022:

Adjusted EBITDA increased by $25.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to increases in revenue, described above, which were partially offset by increases in expenses to support this revenue growth. Refer to discussion in section "Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022."
Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $7.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to increases in expenses being greater than increases in revenue. Refer to discussion in section "Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022."

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity
At December 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $483.2 million, of which $54.4 million was held in foreign currency denominated cash accounts, and an aggregate gross principal amount of $568.2 million of indebtedness outstanding under our 2024 Term Loan B Facility (as defined below) and our Convertible Senior Notes (as defined below). In addition, we were party to a $175.0 million 2024 Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below), of which approximately $5.2 million was assigned to outstanding but undrawn letters of credit. See "Capital Resources" below for further information about our outstanding debt.
Our principal cash requirements for the twelve-month period following this report primarily consists of personnel costs, contractual payment obligations, including office leases, data center costs and cloud hosting costs, capital expenditures, payment of interest and required principal payments on our Convertible Senior Notes and our 2024 Term Loan B Facility, cash outlays for income taxes, and cash requirements to fund working capital. In the longer term, we would expect to have similar cash requirements, with increases in absolute dollars associated with the continued growth of our business and expansion of operations. See "Contractual Obligations and Known Future Cash Requirements" for a further discussion of our known material contractual obligations.
On February 1, 2024, the Board of Directors approved a new repurchase plan (the "February 2024 Repurchase Plan"), which fully replaced the prior repurchase plan, pursuant to which we are authorized to repurchase common stock or Convertible Senior Notes, with an aggregate market value of up to $125.0 million, through February 1, 2026. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we repurchased 1,160,496 shares of the Company's common stock for an aggregate amount of $14.6 million. As of December 31, 2024, $110.4 million remains available under the February 2024 Repurchase Plan.

Our working capital needs and cash conversion cycle, which is influenced by seasonality and by the mix of terms among our buyers and sellers and which may be negatively impacted as a result of pandemics, inflationary, recessionary and other macroeconomic challenges, can have large fluctuations due to the timing of receipts from buyers and timing of disbursements to sellers. In addition, in the event a buyer defaults on payment, we may still be required to pay sellers for the inventory purchased. The impacts from changes in working capital and capital expenditures can significantly impact our cash flows and therefore, our liquidity during any period presented.
We have historically relied upon cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, borrowings under credit facilities and issuance of debt for our liquidity needs. Our ability to meet our cash requirements depends on, among other things, our operating performance, competitive developments, and financial market conditions, all of which are significantly affected by business, financial, economic, political, global health-related and other factors, many of which we may not be able to control or influence.
We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operating activities, and amounts available to borrow under our 2024 Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months from the issuance of our financial statements. However, there are multiple factors that could impact our cash balances in the future, including the factors described above with respect to working capital and cash conversion cycles, as well as the duration and severity of events beyond our control, macroeconomic factors and other factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A: "Risk Factors" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Capital Resources
In March 2021, we sold convertible senior notes ("Convertible Senior Notes") for gross proceeds of $400.0 million. The Convertible Senior Notes are senior, unsecured obligations with interest payable semi-annually in cash at a rate of 0.25% per annum in arrears on March 15 and September 15. The Convertible Senior Notes will mature on March 15, 2026, unless earlier converted, redeemed, or repurchased. The initial conversion rate is 15.6539 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $63.88 per share of the Company’s common stock and is subject to adjustment as described in the Offering Memorandum. At December 31, 2024, the balance of the Convertible Senior Notes was $203.6 million, net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $1.4 million.
In conjunction with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes, we entered into capped call transactions to reduce the Company's exposure to additional cash payments above principal balances in the event of a cash conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes. The Company may owe additional cash or shares to the holders of the Convertible Senior Notes upon early conversion if our stock price exceeds $91.260 per share, which is subject to certain adjustments.
On February 6, 2024, we entered into a credit agreement (the “2024 Credit Agreement”) with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. as our term loan administrative agent and Citibank, N.A. as our revolving facility administrative agent and collateral agent, and other lender parties thereto. The 2024 Credit Agreement provided for a $365.0 million seven-year senior secured term loan facility (the "2024 Term Loan B Facility") and a $175.0 million five-year senior secured revolving credit facility (the "2024 Revolving Credit Facility"). The proceeds from the 2024 Term Loan B Facility were used, among other things, to terminate and to repay in full the outstanding facilities under the prior credit agreement entered into in April 2021 (the "2021 Credit Agreement"), which included a term loan facility (the "2021 Term Loan B Facility") and a revolving facility (the "2021 Revolving Credit Facility"). 
On September 18, 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the 2024 Credit Agreement ("Amendment No. 1"), which reduced the interest rate of the 2024 Term Loan B Facility by 75 basis points to Term SOFR plus a margin of 3.75% from the previous rate of Term SOFR plus a margin of 4.50%. The remaining terms of the 2024 Term Loan B Facility and the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility were substantially unchanged.
At December 31, 2024, the balance of the 2024 Term Loan B Facility was $350.1 million, net of unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs of $13.1 million, and amounts available under the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility were $169.8 million, net of letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $5.2 million.
In the future, we may attempt to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities or through equity-linked or debt financing arrangements. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, the ownership of our existing stockholders may be diluted. If we raise additional financing by incurring indebtedness, we will be subject to increased fixed payment obligations and could also be subject to financial maintenance covenants, or restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Any future indebtedness we incur may result in terms that could be unfavorable to equity investors. An inability to raise additional capital could adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives. 
Our cash and cash equivalents balance is affected by our results of operations, the timing of capital expenditures, and by changes in our working capital, particularly changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable. The timing of cash receipts from buyers and payments to sellers can significantly impact our cash flows from operating activities and our liquidity for, and within, any period presented. Our collection and payment cycle can vary from period to period depending upon various circumstances,

including seasonality, and may be negatively impacted by certain macroeconomic challenges, such as capital market disruptions and instability of financial institutions.

Operating Activities
Our cash flows from operating activities are primarily driven by revenue generated by our business, offset by the cash costs of operations, and are significantly influenced by the timing of and fluctuations in receipts from buyers and related payments to sellers. Our future cash flows will be diminished if we cannot increase our revenue levels and manage costs appropriately.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was $235.2 million, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $214.4 million and $192.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our operating activities included net income of $22.8 million, net loss of $159.2 million, and net loss of $130.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Non-cash adjustments of $135.8 million, $298.1 million, and $282.4 million increased cash provided by operating activities in 2024, 2023, and 2022 respectively. Net changes in our working capital also resulted in increases of $76.6 million, $75.5 million, and $40.4 million in cash provided by operating activities in 2024, 2023, and 2022 respectively. The net changes in working capital for all periods presented are primarily due to the timing of cash receipts from buyers and the timing of payments to sellers. 
Investing Activities
Our primary investing activities have consisted of acquisitions of businesses, purchases of property and equipment, and capital expenditures in support of creating and enhancing our technology infrastructure. Purchases of property and equipment and investments in internal use software development may vary from period-to-period due to the timing of the expansion of our operations, changes to headcount, and the cycles of our internal use software development. 
During the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was $47.5 million, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $37.4 million and $65.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we used cash for purchases of property and equipment of $32.8 million, $26.8 million, and $30.8 million, respectively, and used cash for investments in our internally developed software of $14.3 million, $10.6 million, and $13.6 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we used net cash of $20.8 million to acquire Carbon.

Table of Contents
Financing Activities
Our financing activities consisted of our debt refinancing and repricing activities, Convertible Senior Notes transactions, repayment of amounts borrowed under our 2024 Term Loan B Facility and our 2021 Term Loan B Facility, and transactions related to our share repurchases and equity plans. 
During the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was $28.9 million, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $177.8 million and $30.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Cash outflows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 primarily included $403.1 million of payments related to paying off our 2021 Term Loan B Facility in February 2024 and repricing our 2024 Term Loan B Facility in September 2024, $22.5 million for taxes paid related to net share settlement of stock-based awards, $14.6 million of payments related to share repurchases, and $4.5 million of payments related to debt issuance costs related to the issuance of our 2024 Term Loan B Facility and 2024 Revolver Facility in February 2024. The outflows were partially offset by cash proceeds primarily consisting of $413.5 million from the issuance of our 2024 Term Loan B Facility, net of debt discount, and the repricing of our 2024 Term Loan B Facility in September 2024, and cash proceeds from the employee stock purchase plan of $3.6 million. In connection with the September 2024 repricing, most lenders decided to roll their loan balances over from the original 2024 Term Loan B Facility to the amended 2024 Term Loan B Facility, while some decided to cash out and reassign their loan balances. On September 18, 2024, $312.0 million of the 2024 Term Loan B Facility principal balance was rolled over as part of non-cash financing activities while the remaining lenders who were repaid and then had their loans reissued were included in the $403.1 million cash outflows and the $413.5 million cash proceeds mentioned above.
Cash outflows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily included $165.5 million of payments related to repurchasing our Convertible Senior Notes, $11.8 million for taxes paid related to net share settlement of stock-based awards, $3.6 million for repayment of our 2021 Term Loan B Facility, and $2.3 million for payment of our indemnification claims holdback related to a historical acquisition. These outflows for the year ended December 31, 2023 were partially offset by cash proceeds from issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan of $3.5 million and from stock options exercised of $2.2 million. Cash outflows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 included $15.7 million for payments related to share repurchases, $14.5 million for taxes paid related to net share settlement of stock-based awards, and $3.6 million for repayment of our 2021 Term Loan B Facility. These outflows for the year ended December 31, 2022 were partially offset by cash proceeds from issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan of $3.7 million and from stock options exercised of $2.2 million. 
Contractual Obligations and Known Future Cash Requirements 
Our principal commitments as of December 31, 2024 consist of obligations under our Convertible Senior Notes, 2024 Term Loan B Facility, 2024 Revolving Credit Facility, leases for our various office facilities, including our corporate headquarters in New York, New York and offices in Los Angeles, California, and operating lease agreements, including data centers and cloud hosting services that expire at various times through 2033. In certain cases, the terms of the lease agreements provide for rental payments on a graduated basis.

Obligations for leases not included in the lease liabilities as of December 31, 2024 include commitments under agreements for office space and data centers that have not commenced as of December 31, 2024.
Payments associated with our Convertible Senior Notes, 2024 Term Loan B, and 2024 Revolving Credit Facility are based on contractual terms and intended timing of repayments of long-term debt and associated interest and required fees.
Other non-cancelable obligations above consist of agreements in the normal course of business that are in excess of one year as of December 31, 2024.
In addition, the amounts above exclude commitments due within a year for a cloud-managed services agreement, under which the Company has a remaining non-cancelable minimum spend commitment from January 2025 to June 2025 of $15.9 million.
In the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with sellers, buyers, and other third parties pursuant to which we agree to indemnify buyers, sellers, vendors, lessors, business partners, lenders, stockholders, and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses resulting from claims of intellectual property infringement, damages to property or persons, business losses, or other liabilities. Generally, these indemnity and defense obligations relate to our own business operations, obligations, and acts or omissions. However, under some circumstances, we agree to indemnify and defend contract counterparties against losses resulting from their own business operations, obligations, and acts or omissions, or the business operations, obligations, and acts or omissions of third parties. These indemnity provisions generally survive termination or expiration of the agreements in which they appear. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors, executive officers and certain other officers that will require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors, officers, or employees. No demands for indemnification have been made as of December 31, 2024.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.
56
Table of Contents
We believe that the following assumptions and estimates have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements: (i) the determination of revenue recognition as net versus gross in our revenue arrangements and (ii) the determination of amounts to capitalize and the estimated useful lives of internal-use software development costs. There have been no significant changes in our accounting policies or estimates from those disclosed in our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.
We believe that the accounting policies disclosed below include estimates and assumptions critical to our business and their application could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In addition to these critical policies, our significant accounting policies are included within Note 2 of our "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Revenue Recognition

We generate revenue from transactions where we provide a platform for the purchase and sale of digital advertising inventory. Generally, our revenue is based on a percentage of the ad spend that runs through our platform, although for certain clients, services, or transaction types we may receive a fixed CPM for each impression sold, and for advertising campaigns that are transacted through insertion orders, we earn revenue based on the full amount of ad spend that runs through our platform. In addition, we may receive certain fixed monthly fees for the use of our platform or products. Our platform dynamically connects sellers and buyers of advertising inventory in a digital marketplace. Our solution incorporates proprietary machine-learning algorithms, sophisticated data processing, high-volume storage, detailed analytics capabilities, and a distributed infrastructure. Digital advertising inventory is created when consumers access sellers’ content. Sellers provide digital advertising inventory to our platform in the form of advertising requests, or ad requests. When we receive ad requests from sellers, we send bid requests to buyers, which enable buyers to bid on sellers’ digital advertising inventory. Winning bids can create advertising, or paid impressions, for the seller to present to the consumer. 
The total volume of spending between buyers and sellers on our platform is referred to as advertising spend. We keep a percentage of that advertising spend as a fee, and remit the remainder to the seller. The fee that we retain from the gross advertising spend on our platform is recognized as revenue. The fee earned on each transaction is based on the pre-existing agreement we have with the seller and the clearing price of the winning bid. We recognize revenue upon fulfillment of our performance obligation to a client, which occurs at the point in time an ad renders and is counted as a paid impression, subject to a contract existing with the client and a fixed or determinable transaction price. Performance obligations for all transactions are satisfied, and the corresponding revenue is recognized, at a distinct point in time. We consider the following when determining if a contract exists (i) contract approval by all parties, (ii) identification of each party’s rights regarding the goods or services to be transferred, (iii) specified payment terms, (iv) commercial substance of the contract, and (v) collectability of substantially all of the consideration is probable. 
The determination of whether revenue should be reported on a gross or net basis is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or an agent in the transaction. In determining whether we are acting as the principal or an agent, we followed the accounting guidance for principal-agent considerations. Making such determinations involves judgment and is based on an evaluation of the terms of each arrangement, none of which are considered presumptive or determinative.
For the majority of transactions on our platform, we report revenue on a net basis as we do not act as the principal in the purchase and sale of digital advertising inventory because we do not have control of the digital advertising inventory and do not set prices agreed upon within the auction marketplace. However, with respect to certain revenue streams for managed advertising campaigns that are transacted through insertion orders, we report revenue on a gross basis, based primarily on our determination that we act as the primary obligor in the delivery of advertising campaigns for buyers with respect to such transactions.
Internal Use Software Development Costs
We capitalize certain internal use software development costs associated with creating and enhancing internally developed software related to our technology infrastructure. These costs include personnel and related employee benefits expenses for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time to software projects, and external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining the software. Software development costs that do not meet the qualification for capitalization, as further discussed below, are expensed as incurred and recorded in technology and development expenses in the results of operations.
Software development activities generally consist of three stages, (i) the planning stage, (ii) the application and infrastructure development stage, and (iii) the post implementation stage. Costs incurred in the planning and post implementation stages of software development, including costs associated with the post-configuration training and repairs and maintenance of the developed technologies, are expensed as incurred. We capitalize costs associated with software developed for internal use when the planning stage is completed, management has authorized further funding for the completion of the project, and it is probable that the project will be completed and perform as intended. Costs incurred in the application and infrastructure development stages, including significant enhancements and upgrades, are capitalized. Capitalization ends once a project is substantially complete and the software and technologies are ready for their intended purpose. There is judgment involved in estimating the stage of 
57
Table of Contents
development as well as estimating time allocated to a particular project. A significant change in the time spent on each project could have a material impact on the amount capitalized and related amortization expense in subsequent periods. 
We amortize internal use software development costs using a straight-line method over a three year estimated useful life, commencing when the software is ready for its intended use. The straight-line recognition method approximates the manner in which the expected benefit will be derived. We determined the life of internal use software based on historical software upgrades and replacement. 
On an ongoing basis, we assess if the estimated remaining useful lives of capitalized projects continue to be reasonable based on the remaining expected benefit and usage. If the remaining useful life of a capitalized project is revised, it is accounted for as a change in estimate and the remaining unamortized cost of the underlying asset is amortized prospectively over the updated remaining useful life. We also evaluate internal use software for abandonment and consider that along with other quantitative and qualitative factors as indicators for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
    The information set forth under Note 2 to our "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" under the caption "Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk
    We have operations both in the United States and internationally, and we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks include primarily interest rate, foreign exchange, and inflation risks. The risks below may be further exacerbated by the effects of certain global macroeconomic challenges and market conditions.
Interest Rate Fluctuation Risk
Our cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and money market funds, but may from time to time also include other money market instruments such as commercial paper or U.S. treasury bills, with original maturities of three months or less. Our investments may consist of repurchase agreements, U.S. government agency debt, and U.S. treasury debt. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the value of our cash without significantly increasing risk. Because our cash, cash equivalents, and investments have a short maturity, our portfolio’s fair value is relatively insensitive to interest rate changes, however, interest income earned will vary as interest rates change. 
We do not have economic interest rate expense exposure on our Convertible Senior Notes due to their fixed interest rate nature. The amount paid upon redemption or maturity, before considering any potential additional amount owed due to increases in our underlying share price above the conversion price, is not based on changes in any interest rate index or underlying market interest rates. It is fixed at 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Senior Notes plus unpaid interest. Since the Convertible Senior Notes bear a fixed interest rate, we are not exposed to interest rate risk on those notes, however, the fair value of those notes will change as market interest rates change.
Our 2024 Term Loan B Facility bears a floating rate of interest that resets periodically, subject to a 0% floor on that floating rate, according to the terms of the agreement (the "SOFR Floor"). Our financial results have been exposed to changes in the underlying base interest rate on that debt because the underlying base interest rate resets above the floor on such underlying interest rate. The fair value of the 2024 Term Loan B Facility may fluctuate when the underlying base interest rate fluctuates below the floor or when the rate of return demanded by our loan investors changes relative to when the loans were issued. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility. Should the company borrow under the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility at any point in the future, any associated borrowings would have a floating underlying base rate of interest that would expose the Company to interest rate risk. 
We do not believe that an increase or decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points would have a material effect on our operating results or financial condition. The annualized impact to interest expense for each 100 basis points increase above the SOFR Floor on our 2024 Term Loan B Facility is approximately $3.6 million. The actual impact to our financial results of the same increase in interest rates is expected to be lower depending on the timing and magnitude of such rate changes relative to our SOFR Floor, and will be partially offset by higher interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalent balances over the same period. In future periods, we will continue to evaluate our investment opportunities and policy relative to our overall objectives. 
With regard to all debt currently outstanding, the Company is potentially exposed to refinancing risk in the future, should the Company seek to refinance its debt or raise new debt. As such, the type, cost, and terms of any new debt potentially raised in the future may differ from that of our existing debt agreements.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
As a U.S. based company that does business around the globe, we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, principally the Australian Dollar, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, 
58
Table of Contents
Euro, Japanese Yen, and New Zealand Dollar. Foreign exchange rate volatility is influenced by many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy. In the event our non-U.S. Dollar denominated revenue and expenses increase, or the volatility of the foreign currencies that we transact in increases, our operating results may be more greatly affected by fluctuations in the exchange rates of those foreign currencies. In addition, we have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income (loss) as a result of transaction gains and losses related to translating certain cash balances, trade accounts receivable and payable balances and intercompany balances that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. The effect of an immediate 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates on foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, including intercompany balances, would result in a foreign currency loss of approximately $10.8 million and $9.5 million, respectively. At this time we do not, but we may in the future, enter into derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk.
Inflation Risk
We do not believe that cost inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we might not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. This risk of cost inflation is distinct from the risk that inflation throughout the broader economy could lead to reduced ad spend and indirectly harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For a discussion of the indirect results of inflation on our business, see "Macroeconomic Developments."

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Magnite, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Magnite, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in
 Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 26, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Revenue — Refer to Notes 2 and 4 to the financial statements
.
Critical Audit Matter Description 
The Company generates revenue from transactions where it provides a platform for the purchase and sale of digital advertising inventory. The Company uses automated systems to process and record revenue based on contractual terms with buyers and publishers, and its revenue is comprised of a significant volume of low-dollar transactions. 
We identified revenue as a critical audit matter because the Company’s systems to process and record revenue are highly automated. This required increased extent of effort, including the need for us to involve professionals with expertise in Information Technology (IT) to identify, test, and evaluate the Company’s systems, software applications, and automated controls. 
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
 Our audit procedures related to the Company’s systems to process revenue transactions included the following, among others: 
•
With the assistance of our IT specialists, we:
61
Table of Contents
◦
Identified the significant systems used to process revenue transactions and tested the general IT controls over each of these systems, including testing of user access controls, change management controls, and IT operations controls.
◦
Performed testing of system interface controls and automated controls within the relevant revenue streams, as well as controls designed to ensure the accuracy and completeness of revenue.
◦
Independently created test transactions and traced such transactions through the systems to final output for financial reporting. 
•
We tested internal controls within the relevant revenue business processes, including those in place to reconcile the various systems to the Company’s general ledger. 
•
We evaluated recorded revenue and revenue trends and used data analytics to analyze transactional revenue data. 
•
We used technology-based data analysis tools to inspect journal entries to: 
◦
Identify significant relationships in the revenue population.  
◦
Sufficiently understand identified significant relationships and related accounts affecting revenue. 
•
We performed audit procedures on those related accounts determined to have a significant relationship with revenue.  Such procedures included:
◦
For a sample of accounts receivable balances, evaluating responses to confirmations sent to customers or other evidence such as cash receipts received after year end. 
◦
For a sample of accounts payable – seller balances, performing detail transaction testing by agreeing the amounts recognized to source documents. 
◦
For a sample of cash disbursements made after year end, evaluating whether the amounts were appropriately included in accounts payable – seller as of the balance sheet date. 
◦
Analytical procedures on the accounts payable – seller balance by developing an independent expectation for the recorded balance based on a historical relationship with revenue.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1—
Nature of Operations
    Company Overview
    Magnite, Inc. ("Magnite" or the "Company"), formerly known as The Rubicon Project, Inc., was formed in Delaware and began operations on April 20, 2007. The Company's common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC ("Nasdaq") under the symbol "MGNI." Magnite has its principal offices in New York City, Los Angeles, Denver, London, and Sydney, and additional offices in Europe, Asia, North America, and South America.
    The Company provides a technology solution to automate the purchase and sale of digital advertising inventory for buyers and sellers globally, across all channels, formats and auction types. The Company's platform features applications and services for sellers of digital advertising inventory, or publishers, that own or operate websites, applications, CTV channels, and other digital media properties, to manage and monetize their inventory; applications and services for buyers, including advertisers, agencies, agency trading desks, and demand side platforms, to buy digital advertising inventory; and a transparent, independent marketplace that brings buyers and sellers together and facilitates intelligent decision making and automated transaction execution at scale. The Company's clients include many of the world's leading sellers and buyers of digital advertising inventory.
    Sellers monetize their inventory through the Company’s platform by seamlessly connecting to a global market of integrated buyers that transact through real-time bidding. These transactions include biddable auctions, where multiple buyers bid against each other in a real-time auction for the right to purchase a publisher's inventory, as well as reserve auctions, where publishers establish direct deals or private marketplaces with select buyers. At the same time, buyers leverage the Company’s platform to manage their advertising spending and reach their target audiences, simplify order management and campaign tracking, obtain actionable insights into audiences for their advertising, and access impression-level purchasing from thousands of sellers.

Note 2—
Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Consolidation
    The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, and include the operations of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

Segments
Management has determined that the Company operates as 
one
 operating segment and 
one
 reportable segment. The Company’s chief operating decision maker is the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"). The Company has one primary business activity, where it provides a platform to all of its customers, buyers and sellers, that automates the purchase and sale of digital advertising inventory globally, across all channels, formats, and auction types, as described above in Note 1—Nature of Operations. The Company’s chief operating decision maker reviews financial information on a consolidated basis, principally to make decisions about how to allocate resources and to measure the Company’s performance. The chief operating decision maker reviews consolidated net income (loss), which is the measure of financial profit and loss most closely aligned with generally accepted accounting principles. The chief operating decision maker considers budget-to-actual variances for this measure, predominantly in the annual budget, forecasting process, and quarterly results assessment. The chief operating decision maker does not review any balance sheet information at any other level than on a consolidated basis and does not review any income statement information at any other level than on a consolidated basis with the exception of revenue by geography and by channel. Refer to Note 4
—
Revenues. The significant expense information regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker is the same as that included in the face of the Company's consolidated income statement of operations.

Reclassifications
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation. Specifically, this includes deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2023, being reclassified to other liabilities, non-current on the consolidated balance sheets and (gain) loss on disposal of property and equipment for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, being reclassified to other items, net on the consolidated statements of cash flows.
Use of Estimates
    The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported and disclosed financial statements and accompanying footnotes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.
    On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, primarily those related to: (i) revenue recognition criteria, including the determination of revenue reporting as net versus gross in the Company’s revenue arrangements, (ii) accounts receivable and allowances for doubtful accounts, (iii) amounts capitalized and the useful lives of intangible assets, internal use software development costs, and property and equipment, (iv) valuation of long-lived assets and their recoverability, including goodwill, and (v) the realization of tax assets and estimates of tax liabilities. 
    These estimates are based on historical data and experience, as well as various other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Estimates relating to the allowance for doubtful accounts, amounts capitalized and estimated useful lives of internal-use software development costs, estimated useful lives of long-lived assets, recoverability of intangible assets and goodwill, and income taxes, including the realization of tax assets and estimates of tax liabilities require the selection of appropriate valuation methodologies and models, and judgment in evaluating ranges of assumptions and financial inputs. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or circumstances.
In connection with the Company's periodic review of the estimated useful lives of its property and equipment, the Company extended the estimated useful lives of its network hardware assets from 
three years
 to 
five years
 effective January 1, 2024. The change in estimated useful lives were due to actual and expected longer refresh cycles for these assets. Based on the carrying value of network hardware assets as of December 31, 2023 and those placed in service during the year ended December 31, 2024, the effect of this change in estimate was an increase in income from operations of $
12.6
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and an increase in net income of $
12.6
 million, or $
0.09
 per basic and diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2024. The updated policy reflecting the change in estimated useful lives is below.

Revenue Recognition
    The Company generates revenue from transactions where it provides a platform for the purchase and sale of digital advertising inventory. Generally, the Company's revenue is based on a percentage of the ad spend that runs through its platform, although for certain clients, services, or transaction types the Company may receive a fixed CPM for each impression sold, and for advertising campaigns that are transacted through insertion orders the Company earns revenue based on the full amount of ad spend that runs through its platform. In addition, the Company may receive certain fixed monthly fees for the use of its platform or products. The Company's platform dynamically connects sellers and buyers of advertising inventory in a digital marketplace. The Company's solution incorporates proprietary machine-learning algorithms, sophisticated data processing, high-volume storage, detailed analytics capabilities, and a distributed infrastructure.

Digital advertising inventory is created when consumers access sellers’ content. Sellers provide digital advertising inventory to the Company's platform in the form of advertising requests, or ad requests. When the Company receives ad requests from sellers, it sends bid requests to buyers, which enable buyers to bid on sellers’ digital advertising inventory. Winning bids can create advertising, or paid impressions, for the seller to present to the consumer. 
    The total volume of spending between buyers and sellers on the Company's platform is referred to as advertising spend. The Company keeps a percentage of that advertising spend as a fee, and remits the remainder to the seller. The fee that the Company retains from the gross advertising spend on its platform is recognized as revenue. The fee earned on each transaction is based on the pre-existing agreement between the Company and the seller and the clearing price of the winning bid. The Company recognizes revenue upon fulfillment of its performance obligation to a client, which occurs at the point in time an ad renders and is counted as a paid impression, subject to a contract existing with the client and a fixed or determinable transaction price. The Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which the Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it has the right to invoice for services performed. The Company considers the following when determining if a contract exists (i) contract approval by all parties, (ii) identification of each 
70
Table of Contents
party’s rights regarding the goods or services to be transferred, (iii) specified payment terms, (iv) commercial substance of the contract, and (v) collectability of substantially all of the consideration is probable. 
     The determination of whether revenue should be reported on a gross or net basis is based on an assessment of whether the Company is acting as the principal or an agent in the transaction. In determining whether the Company is acting as the principal or an agent, the Company follows the accounting guidance for principal-agent considerations. Making such determinations involves judgment and is based on an evaluation of the terms of each arrangement, none of which are considered presumptive or determinative.
Expenses
The Company classifies its expenses into the following categories:

Cost of Revenue. 
The Company's cost of revenue primarily consists of cloud hosting, data center, and bandwidth costs, ad verification costs, depreciation and maintenance expense of hardware supporting the Company's revenue-producing platform, amortization of internally-developed software costs for the development of the Company's revenue-producing platform, amortization expense associated with acquired developed technologies, personnel costs, and software costs. In addition, for revenue booked on a gross basis, cost of revenue includes traffic acquisition costs. Personnel costs included in cost of revenue include salaries, bonuses, and stock-based compensation, and are primarily attributable to personnel in the Company's network operations group who support the Company's platform. The Company capitalizes costs associated with software that is developed or obtained for internal use and amortizes the costs associated with its revenue-producing platform in cost of revenue over their estimated useful lives. The Company amortizes acquired developed technologies over their estimated useful lives.

Sales and Marketing. 
The Company's sales and marketing expenses primarily consists of personnel costs, including salaries, bonuses, and stock-based compensation, as well as marketing expenses such as brand marketing, travel expenses, trade shows and marketing materials, amortization expense associated with client relationships, and non-compete agreements from the Company's business acquisitions, professional services, facilities-related costs, and depreciation expense. The Company's sales and support organization focuses on increasing the adoption of the Company's solution by existing and new buyers and sellers and supports ongoing client relationships. The Company amortizes acquired intangibles associated with client relationships from its business acquisitions over their estimated useful lives.

Technology and Development. 
The Company's technology and development expenses primarily consists of personnel costs, including salaries, bonuses, and stock-based compensation, as well as professional services associated with the ongoing development and maintenance of the Company's solution, software costs, facilities-related costs, and depreciation and amortization expense. These expenses include costs incurred in the development, implementation, and maintenance of internal use software, including platform and related infrastructure. Technology and development costs are expensed as incurred, except to the extent that such costs are associated with internal use software development that qualifies for capitalization, which are then recorded as internal use software development costs, net, on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The Company amortizes internal use software development costs that relate to its revenue-producing activities on the Company's platform to cost of revenue and amortize other internal use software development costs to technology and development costs or general and administrative expenses, depending on the nature of the related project. The Company amortizes acquired intangibles associated with technology and development functions from its business acquisitions over their estimated useful lives.

General and Administrative. 
The Company's general and administrative expenses primarily consists of personnel costs, including salaries, bonuses, and stock-based compensation, associated with the Company's executive, finance, legal, human resources, compliance, and other administrative personnel, as well as accounting and legal professional services fees, facilities-related costs, depreciation expense, bad debt expense, and other corporate-related expenses.

Merger, Acquisition, and Restructuring Costs.
 The Company's merger, acquisition, and restructuring costs primarily consists of professional service fees associated with merger and acquisition activities, cash-based employee termination costs, related stock-based compensation charges, and other restructuring activities, including facility closures, relocation costs, contract termination costs, and impairment costs of abandoned technology associated with restructuring activities.

Stock-Based Compensation
    Compensation expense related to employee and non-employee stock-based awards is measured and recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on the fair value of the awards granted. The Company grants awards to employees that vest based solely on continued service, or service conditions, awards that vest based on the achievement of performance targets, or performance conditions, and awards that vest based on the Company's stock price exceeding a peer index, or market conditions. The fair value of restricted stock units that vest based on continued service is equal to the closing price of the Company's common stock as reported on the Nasdaq on the grant date. The fair value of each option award containing service conditions is estimated on the 
71
Table of Contents
grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Generally, option awards have a contractual term of 
ten years
. The fair value of awards containing market conditions is estimated using a Monte-Carlo simulation model. For service condition awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally 
four years
. For performance condition and market condition awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized using a graded vesting model over the requisite service period of the awards. For market condition awards, expense recognized is not subsequently reversed if the market conditions are not achieved. The Company accounts for forfeitures when they occur.
The assumptions and estimates used in the Black-Scholes pricing model are as follows:
    Fair Value of Common Stock.
 The fair value of common stock is based on the closing price of the Company's common stock as reported on the Nasdaq on the grant date. 

Risk-Free Interest Rate.
 The Company bases the risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities appropriate for the term of stock option awards.
    Expected Term.
 For employee stock options the expected term is determined based on historical trends. The expected term of employee stock options that contain performance conditions represents the weighted-average period that the stock options are estimated to remain outstanding.
    Volatility.
 The computation of the expected volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock. 
    Dividend Yield.
 The dividend yield assumption is based on the Company’s history and current expectations of dividend payouts. The Company has never declared or paid any cash dividends on its common stock and does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, so the Company used an expected dividend yield of 
zero
.
    Determining the fair value of stock-based awards with performance and market conditions requires judgment. The Company's use of the Monte-Carlo simulation model requires the input of subjective assumptions, such as the expected term of the award, the expected volatility of the price of the Company’s common stock, risk-free interest rates, the expected dividend yield of the Company’s common stock, in addition for those awards containing market conditions, which also include expected volatilities of selected peer companies, and expected correlation coefficients of the Company and those of the selected peer companies. The assumptions used in the Company’s valuation model represent management’s best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, the Company’s stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.

Income Taxes
    Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the net tax effects of the differences between the Company’s consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rate expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the differences are expected to be reversed.
    A valuation allowance is used to reduce some or all of the deferred tax assets if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that those deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company maintains a partial valuation allowance to offset its domestic net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of realizing future income tax benefits from the net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets.
    The Company recognizes the income tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The income tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized. The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to its uncertain tax positions in its income tax provision (benefit) in the consolidated statements of operations.

Table of Contents

Capital Stock    
    The Company has authorized capital stock of 
500,000,000
 shares of common stock and 
10,000,000
 shares of preferred stock. The Company has issued common stock, which is included in outstanding common stock on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. From time to time, the Company has repurchased shares of common stock, which has been recorded as treasury stock on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. All treasury stock has been subsequently retired. The Company has not issued any shares of its preferred stock subsequent to the Company's initial public offering ("IPO") and does not have any preferred stock outstanding.
    The Company is required to reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of common stock such number of shares sufficient to affect the conversion of all shares granted and available for grant under the Company’s stock award plans. The number of shares of the Company's stock reserved for these purposes at December 31, 2024 was 
40,333,967
.
    The board of directors is authorized to establish, from time to time, the number of shares to be included in each series of preferred stock, and to fix the designation, powers, privileges, preferences, and relative participating, optional or other rights, if any, of the shares of each series of preferred stock, and any of its qualifications, limitations or restrictions.

Net Income (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders
    Basic net income (loss) per share of common stock is calculated by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted income per share considers adjustments to net income and the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the effect of potentially dilutive securities during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of stock options, restricted stock units, performance stock units, potential shares issuable under the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP"), and potential shares issuable as part of the Convertible Senior Notes. Diluted income per share is computed utilizing the treasury method for options, restricted stock units, performance stock units, and potential ESPP shares. Diluted income per share for the Convertible Senior Notes is calculated under the if-converted method. Potential common share equivalents are excluded where their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. For periods in which the Company reports net loss, diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share because the effects of potentially dilutive securities would be anti-dilutive.

Comprehensive Income (Loss)
    Comprehensive income (loss) encompasses all changes in equity other than those arising from transactions with stockholders, and consists of net income (loss), unrealized gains (losses) on investments and foreign currency translation adjustments.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
    The Company invests excess cash primarily in money market funds, corporate debt securities, and highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies.

The Company classifies investments held in money market funds as cash equivalents because the money market funds have weighted-average maturities at the date of purchase of less than 90 days, are freely redeemable into cash and have a constant net asset value.

Restricted Cash
    The Company classifies certain restricted cash balances within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets, non-current on the consolidated balance sheets based upon the term of the remaining restrictions.

Accounts Receivable Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
    Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount, are unsecured, and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on historical collection experience and the review in each period of the status of the then-outstanding accounts receivable, while taking into consideration current client information, subsequent collection history and other relevant data. The Company reviews the allowance for doubtful accounts on a quarterly basis. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when the Company believes it is probable the receivable will not be recovered.

73
Table of Contents

Property and Equipment, Net
    Property and equipment are recorded at historical cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based upon the estimated useful lives of the assets. 
The estimated useful lives of the Company’s property and equipment are as follows:
Years
Computer equipment and network hardware
3
 to 
5
Furniture, fixtures and office equipment
5
 to 
7
Leasehold improvements
Shorter of useful life or life of lease
Purchased software
3
    Repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred, while renewals and improvements are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the Company’s results of operations.

Internal Use Software Development Costs

The Company capitalizes certain internal use software development costs associated with creating and enhancing internally developed software related to the Company’s technology infrastructure. These costs include personnel and related employee benefits expenses for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time to software projects, and external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining the software. Software development costs that do not meet the qualification for capitalization, as further discussed below, are expensed as incurred and recorded in technology and development expenses in the results of operations.
    Software development activities generally consist of three stages, (i) the planning stage, (ii) the application and infrastructure development stage, and (iii) the post implementation stage. Costs incurred in the planning and post implementation stages of software development, including costs associated with the post-configuration training and repairs and maintenance of the developed technologies, are expensed as incurred. The Company capitalizes costs associated with software developed for internal use when the planning stage is completed, management has authorized further funding for the completion of the project, and it is probable that the project will be completed and perform as intended. Costs incurred in the application and infrastructure development stages, including significant enhancements and upgrades, are capitalized. Capitalization ends once a project is substantially complete and the software and technologies are ready for their intended purpose. Internal use software development costs are amortized using a straight-line method over the estimated useful life, which is generally 
three years
, commencing when the software is ready for its intended use. The straight-line recognition method approximates the manner in which the expected benefit will be derived. On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses the remaining estimated useful lives of internal use software projects. If remaining useful lives are revised, the change is accounted for as a change in estimate.

The Company does not transfer ownership of its software, or lease its software, to third parties.
Intangible Assets
    Intangible assets primarily consist of acquired developed technology, client relationships, and in-process research and development projects resulting from business combinations, which are recorded at acquisition-date fair value, less accumulated amortization. The Company determines the appropriate useful life of its intangible assets by performing an analysis of expected cash flows of the acquired assets. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using a straight-line method, which approximates the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed.

The Company’s intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives as follows:
Years
Developed technology
5
In-process research and development
3
 to 
5
Customer relationships
0.5
 to 
4
Non-compete agreements
1
 to 
2
Other intangible assets
3
 to 
10
74
Table of Contents

On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses the remaining estimated useful lives of intangible assets. If remaining useful lives are revised, the change is accounted for as a change in estimate.
Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment indicators at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. For intangible assets used in operations, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows at the asset group level that represents the lowest level of independent cash flows. The Company measures the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets including Internal Use Capitalized Software Costs
    The Company assesses the recoverability of its long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable. Such events or changes in circumstances may include: a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used, significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long-lived asset, an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or development of a long-lived asset, current or future operating or cash flow losses that demonstrate continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset, or a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. The Company performs impairment testing at the asset group level that represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. The Company assesses recoverability of a long-lived asset by determining whether the carrying value of the asset group can be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows over their remaining lives. If the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the forecasted undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized, measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds estimated fair value. An impairment loss is charged to operations in the period in which management determines such impairment.

Business Combinations
    The results of businesses acquired in a business combination are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The Company allocates the purchase price of a business combination, which is the sum of the consideration provided, which may consist of cash, equity or a combination of the two, to the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business at their acquisition date fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenues and cash flows, discount rates and selection of comparable companies.
    When the Company issues stock-based or cash awards to an acquired company’s stockholders, the Company evaluates whether the awards are contingent consideration or compensation for post-business combination services. The evaluation includes, among other things, whether the vesting of the awards is contingent on the continued employment of the selling stockholder beyond the acquisition date. If continued employment is required for vesting, the awards are treated as compensation for post-acquisition services and recognized as expense over the requisite service period.
    The Company estimates the fair value of intangible assets acquired generally using a discounted cash flow approach, which includes an analysis of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset and the risk associated with achieving these cash flows. The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model include the discount rate that is applied to the forecasted future cash flows to calculate the present value of those cash flows and the estimate of future cash flows attributable to the acquired intangible asset, which include revenue, expenses and taxes. The carrying value of acquired working capital assets and liabilities approximates its fair value, given the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities.
    Acquisition-related transaction costs are not included as a component of consideration transferred, but are accounted for as an expense in the period in which the costs are incurred.

Goodwill
    Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate fair value of the consideration transferred in a business combination over the fair value of the assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to impairment testing conducted annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired.

Table of Contents
    In accordance with guidance related to impairment testing, the Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether or not it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If the qualitative assessment option is not elected, or if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative analysis is then performed. The quantitative analysis, if performed, compares the estimated fair value of the Company with its respective carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the Company exceeds its carrying amount, including goodwill, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. If the fair value is less than the carrying amount, including goodwill, then an impairment adjustment must be recorded up to the carrying amount of goodwill.
    The Company operates as a single operating segment and has identified a single reporting unit.

Operating Leases
The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. A contract is or contains a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Company's classes of assets that are leased include office facilities, data centers, and equipment. The Company has elected not to recognize short-term leases on the balance sheet, nor separate lease and non-lease components for data center leases. In addition, the Company utilized the portfolio approach to group leases with similar characteristics together. 
 For identified leases, the Company used its incremental borrowing rate to discount the related future payment obligations, which represents the rate of interest the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment.
The Company records rent expense for operating leases, including leases of office facilities, data centers, and equipment, on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The straight-line calculation of rent expense includes rent escalations on certain leases, as well as lease incentives provided by the landlords, including payments for leasehold improvements and rent-free periods. The Company begins recognition of rent expense on the commencement date, which is generally the date that the asset is made available for use. The Company also records variable lease expense primarily related to operating expenses, utilities, or other costs that are subject to fluctuation. Lease liability, which represents the present value of the Company's obligation related to the estimated future lease payments, is included in lease liabilities, current and lease liabilities, non-current within the consolidated balance sheets. These liability balances are reduced as lease related payments are made. For operating leases, the right-of-use ("ROU") assets are amortized on a periodic basis over the expected term of the lease (see Note 15).

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
    The carrying amounts of the Company's cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and seller payables approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. Certain assets of the Company are recorded at their fair value, using the fair value hierarchy, on a recurring basis, and other assets and liabilities, including goodwill and intangible assets are subject to measurement at fair value on a non-recurring basis if they are deemed to be impaired as a result of an impairment review (see Note 5).

Concentration of Risk
    Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and accounts receivable. Cash maintained with financial institutions typically exceeds applicable federally insured limits in the U.S. and may not be covered by similar local depositor insurance schemes for cash held in foreign currencies or in bank accounts outside of the U.S. Cash equivalents, primarily money market fund investments, are not insured by federal insurance schemes and are exposed to other potential risks linked to high concentration among major custodial banks.
    Accounts receivable include amounts due from buyers with principal operations primarily in the United States. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its buyers.

At December 31, 2024, two buyers accounted for 
46
% and 
11
%, respectively, of consolidated accounts receivable, net. At December 31, 2023, two buyers accounted for 
48
% and 
11
%, respectively, of accounts receivable, net. 
    The Company recognizes revenue from its contracts with sellers. No seller of advertising inventory accounted for 10% or more of revenue during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.

At December 31, 2024, one seller of advertising inventory accounted for 
28
% of accounts payable and accrued expenses and at December 31, 2023, one seller of advertising inventory accounted for 
29
% of accounts payable and accrued expenses.

Foreign Currency Transactions and Translation
    Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency of the applicable entity at the rates of exchange in effect at the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains or losses are included in foreign exchange (gain) loss, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. To the extent that the functional currency is different from the U.S. Dollar, the financial statements have then been translated into U.S. Dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates for the results of operations. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280) – Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures ("ASU 2023-07"). ASU 2023-07 expands public entities’ segment disclosures by requiring disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, an amount and description of its composition for other segment items, and interim disclosures of a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets. ASU 2023-07 was effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023 and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company adopted this standard during the year ended December 31, 2024. See section 
Segments
 within this footnote for further detail.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740) – 
Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
 ("ASU 2023-09") to enhance income tax information primarily through changes in the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 on a prospective basis. Early adoption and retrospective application are permitted. The Company will adopt the guidance for the annual period beginning January 1, 2025. The Company expects the impact of adoption of this guidance to be limited to footnote disclosure and to result in additional disaggregation of information disclosed in the rate reconciliation and with respect to income taxes paid.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40) - 
Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
 ("ASU 2024-03"). ASU 2024-03 requires additional disclosures of the nature of expenses included in the income statement and presented in the footnotes. ASU 2024-03 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027 on a prospective basis. Early adoption and retrospective application are permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting guidance on its disclosures.
The Company does not believe there are any other recently issued and effective or not yet effective pronouncements that would have or are expected to have a material impact on the Company’s present or future consolidated financial statements.

Revenues
For the majority of transactions on the Company's platform, the Company reports revenue on a net basis as it does not act as the principal in the purchase and sale of digital advertising inventory because it does not have control of the digital advertising inventory and does not set prices agreed upon within the auction marketplace. For certain advertising campaigns that are transacted through insertion orders, the Company reports revenue on a gross basis, based primarily on its determination that the Company acts as the primary obligor in the delivery of advertising campaigns for buyers with respect to such transactions.
The following table presents the Company's revenue recognized on a net basis and on a gross basis for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022:

Payment terms are specified in agreements between the Company and the buyers and sellers on its platform. The Company generally bills buyers at the end of each month for the full purchase price of impressions filled in that month. The Company recognizes volume discounts as a reduction of revenue as they are incurred. Specific payment terms may vary by agreement, but are generally 
seventy-five days
 or less. The Company's accounts receivable are recorded at the amount of gross billings to buyers, net of allowances for the amounts the Company is responsible to collect. The Company's accounts payable related to amounts due to sellers are recorded at the net amount payable to sellers (see Note 10). Accordingly, both accounts receivable and accounts payable appear large in relation to revenue reported on a net basis.
Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount, are unsecured, and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed quarterly, requires judgment, and is based on the best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable. The Company reviews the status of the then-outstanding accounts receivable on a customer-by-customer basis, taking into consideration the aging schedule of receivables, its historical collection experience, current information regarding the client, subsequent collection history, and other relevant data, in establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts receivable are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $
2.9
 million at December 31, 2024, and $
20.4
 million at December 31, 2023. Accounts receivable are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when the Company determines amounts are no longer collectible.

The Company reviews the associated payable to sellers for recovery of buyer receivable allowance and write-offs; in some cases, the Company can reduce the payable to sellers. The reduction of seller payables related to recovery of uncollected buyer receivables is netted against allowance expense. The contra seller payables related to recoveries were $
1.9

During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company wrote off $
19.0
 million of allowance for doubtful accounts, of which $
18.5
 million was attributable to the outstanding accounts receivable from a buyer that filed for bankruptcy during 2023.
The change in provision for expected credit losses associated with accounts receivable and the offsetting impact of the change to contra seller payables related to recoveries of uncollected buyer receivables result in the amount of bad debt expense or recoveries the Company recognizes each year. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the increase in the provision for expected credit losses associated with accounts receivable of $
1.4
 million was partially offset by increases of contra seller payables related to recoveries of uncollected buyer receivables, which resulted in an immaterial amount of bad debt expense. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the increase in the provision for expected credit losses associated with accounts receivable of $
20.1
 million was offset by increases of contra seller payables related to recoveries of uncollected buyer receivables of $
15.4
 million, which resulted in  $
4.7
 million of bad debt expense. The increase in the provision for expected credit losses was primarily attributed to one buyer filing for bankruptcy, resulting in $
4.2
 million of bad debt expense during the year ended December 31, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the decrease in the provision for expected credit losses associated with accounts receivable of $
1.7
 million was offset by decreases of contra seller payables related to recoveries of uncollected buyer receivables of $
1.6
 million, which resulted in an immaterial amount of bad debt recoveries.

Note 5—
Fair Value Measurements 
Recurring Fair Value Measurements

    Fair value represents the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Observable inputs are based on market data obtained from independent sources. The fair value hierarchy is based on the following three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last one is considered unobservable: 
•
Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.
•
Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
•
Level 3 – Unobservable inputs.

The carrying amounts of cash equivalents are classified as Level 1 or Level 2 depending on whether or not their fair values are based on quoted market prices for identical securities that are traded in an active market.
At December 31, 2024, the Company had debt outstanding under its Convertible Senior Notes and loans under its 2024 Term Loan B Facility (as defined in Note 17) and at December 31, 2023, had debt outstanding under its Convertible Senior Notes and loans under its 2021 Term Loan B Facility (as defined in Note 17) included in its balance sheets. The estimated fair value of the Company's Convertible Senior Notes was $
190.2
 million and $
174.3
 million, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The estimated fair value of Convertible Senior Notes is based on market rates and the closing trading price of the Convertible Senior Notes as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and is classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the estimated fair value of the Company's 2024 Term Loan B Facility and of the Company's 2021 Term Loan B Facility was $
368.2
 million and $
352.3
 million, respectively. The estimated fair value is based on borrowing rates currently available to the Company for financing with similar terms and is classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Business Combinations
2022 Acquisition—Carbon
The Company completed the acquisition of the business of Carbon (AI) Limited ("Carbon" and such acquisition the "Carbon Acquisition"), a platform that enables publishers to measure, manage, and monetize audience segments, in February 2022 for a total purchase price of $
23.1
 million in cash. Approximately $
2.3
 million of the purchase price was held back to cover possible indemnification claims, which was subsequently paid out in February 2023. The Company acquired Carbon as part of its strategy to further invest in the development and enhancement of industry leading identity and audience solutions. The allocation of purchase consideration resulted in an estimated $
14.2
 million of developed technology intangible assets with an estimated useful life of 
five years
, $
0.2
 million non-compete intangible assets with an estimated useful life of 
two years
, $
0.2
 million of customer relationships with an estimated useful life of 
six months
, and goodwill of $
8.5
 million, which is attributable to the workforce of Carbon and

revenue growth from the acquisition. For tax purposes, the Carbon Acquisition was treated as an asset acquisition. The acquisition of identified intangibles results in tax deductible amortization pursuant to IRC Section 197.
Acquisition related costs associated with the Carbon Acquisition included in merger, acquisition, and restructuring costs in the Company's consolidated statements of operations during the year ended December 31, 2022 were immaterial. In addition, Carbon's post-acquisition revenue and operating results on a standalone basis were immaterial.

Stock-Based Compensation 
    In connection with its IPO, the Company implemented its 2014 Equity Incentive Plan, which governs equity awards made to employees and directors of the Company since the IPO. In November 2014, the Company approved the 2014 Inducement Grant Equity Incentive Plan (the "Inducement Plan"), which governs certain equity awards made to certain employees in connection with commencement of employment. In connection with the Company's acquisition of nToggle, Inc. ("nToggle"), it assumed the nToggle 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the "nToggle Plan"), and in connection with the merger with Telaria, Inc. ("Telaria"), the Company assumed Telaria's 2013 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (the "Telaria Plan"). Available shares under the nToggle Plan and the Telaria Plan were rolled into the available share pool under the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan at the time of acquisition of and merger with, respectively, each company. On June 14, 2023, the Company's stockholders approved the Magnite, Inc. Amended and Restated 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Amended and Restated 2014 Equity Incentive Plan"), which, among other things, increased the aggregate maximum number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the plan, removed the prior evergreen provision, and extended the plan through April 2033. All compensatory equity awards outstanding at December 31, 2024 were issued pursuant to the Amended and Restated 2014 Equity Incentive Plan, the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan, the nToggle Plan, the Telaria Plan, or the Inducement Plan.
    The Company’s equity incentive plans provide for the grant of equity awards, including non-statutory or incentive stock options, restricted stock awards ("RSAs"), restricted stock units that vest based on continuous service ("RSUs"), and restricted stock units that include performance criteria (“performance stock units” or "PSUs"), to the Company's employees, officers, directors, and consultants. The Company's board of directors administers the plans. Options vest based upon continued service at varying rates, but generally over 
four years
 from issuance with 
25
% vesting after 
one year
 of service and the remainder vesting monthly thereafter. RSAs and RSUs vest at varying rates, typically approximately 
25
% vesting after approximately 
one year
 of service and the remainder vesting annually, semi-annually, or quarterly thereafter. In addition, each Director of the Company's Board of Directors 
84
Table of Contents
receives an annual grant which vests at the earlier of the one year anniversary of the grant date and the following annual shareholder meeting in addition to an initial equity awards in the first year of their election into the Board of Directors. Options, RSAs, RSUs, and PSUs granted under the plans accelerate under certain circumstances for certain participants upon a change in control, as defined in the governing plan. As of December 31, 2024, an aggregate of 
18,669,345
 shares remained available for future grants, assuming target number of PSUs, under the Amended and Restated 2014 Equity Incentive Plan.

Performance Stock Units
The Company granted 
379,635
 PSUs to the Company's CEO in August 2021, (the "August 2021 PSUs"), which are subject to both time-based and performance-based vesting conditions. The PSUs consist of 
three
 equal tranches (each, a "Performance Tranche"), based on achievement of a share price condition if the Company achieves share price targets of $
60.00
, $
80.00
, and $
100.00
, respectively, over 
60
 consecutive trading days during a performance period commencing on August 26, 2022 and ending on August 26, 2026. The grant date fair value for such PSUs was estimated using a Monte-Carlo simulation model that incorporates option-pricing inputs covering the period from the grant date through the end of the performance period. To the extent any of the performance-based requirements are met, the Company's CEO must also provide continued service to the Company through at least August 26, 2024 to receive any shares of common stock underlying the grant and through August 26, 2026 to receive all of the shares of common stock underlying the performance units that have satisfied the applicable performance-based requirement.
In 2022 and 2023, the Company granted PSUs to select executive employees that vest based on share price metrics tied to total shareholder return ("TSR") relative to a peer group over a 
three-year
 period, assuming a performance measurement of 
100
%. These PSUs are also subject to a time-based service component. The grant date fair value for such PSUs was estimated using a Monte-Carlo simulation model that incorporates option-pricing inputs covering the period from the grant date through the end of the performance period. Between 
0
% and 
150
% of the performance stock units will vest at the end of the performance period, which is generally on the third anniversary of the PSU grant date.
In 2024, the Company additionally granted PSUs with an aggregate target of 
486,431
 shares, assuming a performance measurement of 
100
%. The amount of shares that will ultimately vest will be determined based on the Company's TSR relative to the TSRs of a peer group for the 
three-year
 period beginning January 1, 2024, as well as certain interim measurements based on relative TSR for the 
one-year
 and 
two-year
 periods beginning on January 1, 2024. At December 31, 2024, the first one-year interim performance measurement was 
150
%, subject to the remaining vesting criteria.
Stock-based compensation expense for PSUs is based on the grant date fair value and the number of shares assuming a performance measurement of 
100
%. The compensation expense will not be reversed if the performance metrics are not met.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

In November 2013, the Company adopted the Company's 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP"). The ESPP is designed to enable eligible employees to periodically purchase shares of the Company's common stock at a discount through payroll deductions of up to 
10
% of their eligible compensation, subject to any plan limitations. At the end of each 
six-month
 offering period, employees are able to purchase shares at a price per share equal to 
85
% of the lower of the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the first trading day of the offering period or on the last trading day of the offering period. Offering periods generally commence and end in May and November of each year.
    On June 14, 2023, the Company's stockholders approved the Magnite, Inc. Amended and Restated 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Amended and Restated 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan"), which, among other things, removed the evergreen provision and extended the plan through June 2033.

    The Company recorded an income tax expense of $
3.7
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to an income tax expense of $
1.6
 million and an income tax benefit of $
5.3
 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily the result of the domestic valuation allowance on the Company's deferred tax assets and the federal, state, and foreign income tax liabilities. The income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily the result of the domestic valuation allowance on the Company's deferred tax assets and the federal, state, and foreign income tax liabilities. The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily the result of recognizing the benefit of deferred tax assets previously subject to the domestic valuation allowance and the income tax liability associated with foreign subsidiaries. The net deferred tax liabilities recorded in connection with prior acquisitions and current taxable income for the year provided sources of taxable income to support the realization of pre-existing deferred tax assets. 

Set forth below is a reconciliation of the components that caused the Company’s provision (benefit) for income taxes to differ from amounts computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022:

    As of December 31, 2024, the net deferred tax liabilities of $
0.4
 million is presented in the Company's consolidated balance sheets as part of other liabilities, non-current, of $
0.7
 million and other assets, non-current of $
0.3
 million. As of December 31, 2023, the net deferred tax liabilities of $
0.3
 million is presented in the Company's consolidated balance sheets as part of other liabilities, non-current, of $
0.7
 million and other assets, non-current of $
0.4
 million. The valuation allowance was decreased by $
12.6
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, and increased by $
30.2
 million, and $
20.7
 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
    At December 31, 2024, the Company had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of approximately $
263.9
 million, which will begin to expire in 2037. At December 31, 2024, the Company had state NOLs of approximately $
204.8
 million, which will begin to expire in 2028. At December 31, 2024, the Company had foreign NOLs of approximately $
17.7
 million, which will begin to expire in 2026. At December 31, 2024, the Company had acquired federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $
6.2
 million which will begin to expire in 2036, and state research and development tax credits of approximately $
10.2
 million, the majority of which carry forward indefinitely.
In addition, various foreign jurisdictions where the Company has activity have enacted or are considering enacting a variety of measures that could impact the Company's tax liabilities. The Company is monitoring new legislation and evaluating the potential tax implications of these measures globally.
Pursuant to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, the Company and Telaria, Inc. both underwent ownership changes for tax purposes (i.e. a more than 50% change in stock ownership in aggregated 5% shareholders) on April 1, 2020 due to the merger with Telaria. As a result, the use of the Company’s total domestic NOL carryforwards and tax credits generated prior to the ownership change will be subject to annual use limitations under Section 382 and Section 383 of the Code and comparable state income tax laws. The Company believes that the ownership change will not impact its ability to utilize substantially all of its NOLs and state research and development carryforward tax credits to the extent it will generate taxable income that can be offset by such losses. The Company reasonably expects some of its federal research and development carryforward tax credits will not be recovered prior to expiration.
90
Table of Contents
    Additionally, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act limits the NOL deduction to 80% of taxable income, repeals carryback of all NOLs arising in a tax year ending after 2017, and permits indefinite carryforward for all such NOLs. NOL’s arising in a tax year ending in or before 2017 can offset 100% of taxable income, are available for carryback, and expire 20 years after they arise.
    At December 31, 2024, unremitted earnings of the subsidiaries outside of the United States were approximately $
35.5
 million. The Company’s intention is to indefinitely reinvest these earnings outside the United States. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of a dividend or otherwise, the Company would be subject to withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries and, potentially, various state taxes. The amounts of such tax liabilities that might be payable upon actual repatriation of foreign earnings, after consideration of corresponding foreign tax credits, are not material.

    Interest and penalties related to the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits accrued at December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 were not material.
    Due to the net operating loss carryforwards, the Company's United States federal and a majority of its state returns are open to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and state jurisdictions for all years since inception. For the India, Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, all tax years remain open for examination by the local country tax authorities, for France only 2022 and forward are open, for Australia and Singapore only 2021 and forward are open for examination, for Brazil, Canada, Germany, and Malaysia only 2020 and forward are open for examination, for Italy and New Zealand only 2019 and forward are open for examination, and for Japan 2018 and forward remain open for examination. 
    The Company does not expect its uncertain income tax positions to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements within the next twelve months.
Note 15—
Leases
The Company has operating leases for office facilities and data centers. The lease terms of the Company’s operating leases generally range from 
1.0
 year to 
10.0
 years. The Company's lease terms include periods under options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. The weighted average remaining lease term of leases included in lease liabilities is 
4.6
 years and 
5.2
 years as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, a weighted average discount rate of 
6.12
% and 
6.19
%, respectively, were applied to the remaining lease payments to calculate the lease liabilities included within the consolidated balance sheets. 
Operating lease expense was $
21.2
 million, $
24.5
 million and $
23.3
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Included in operating lease expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 was a gain of $
1.8
 million related to the early termination of an office facility lease. The Company recognized variable lease expense of $
1.6
 million, $
3.8
 million, and

$

In addition to the lease liabilities included in these consolidated financial statements, the Company entered into agreements for office space and data centers that had not commenced as of December 31, 2024; therefore, the leases were not included in the lease liabilities and ROU assets balance as of December 31, 2024. The Company has future commitments totaling $
25.9
 million over a term of

 years related to these agreements.

Guarantees and Indemnification
    The Company’s agreements with sellers, buyers, and other third parties typically obligate the Company to provide indemnity and defense for losses resulting from claims of intellectual property infringement, damages to property or persons, business losses, or other liabilities. Generally, these indemnity and defense obligations relate to the Company’s own business operations, obligations, and acts or omissions. However, under some circumstances, the Company agrees to indemnify and defend contract counterparties against losses resulting from their own business operations, obligations, and acts or omissions, or the business operations, obligations, and acts or omissions of third parties. For example, because the Company’s business interposes the Company between buyers and sellers in various ways, buyers often require the Company to indemnify them against acts and omissions of sellers, and sellers often require the Company to indemnify them against acts and omissions of buyers. In addition, the Company’s agreements with sellers, buyers, and other third parties typically include provisions limiting the Company’s liability to the counterparty, and the counterparty’s liability to the Company. These limits sometimes do not apply to certain liabilities, including indemnity obligations. These indemnity and limitation of liability provisions generally survive termination or expiration of the agreements in which they appear. The Company has also entered into indemnification agreements with its directors, executive officers, and certain other officers that will require the Company, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors, officers, or employees. No material demands have been made upon the Company to provide indemnification under such agreements and there are no claims that the Company is aware of that could have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 
Litigation 
The Company and its subsidiaries may from time to time be parties to legal or regulatory proceedings, lawsuits and other claims incident to their business activities and to the Company’s status as a public company. Such matters may include, among other things, assertions of contract breach or intellectual property infringement, claims for indemnity arising in the course of the Company’s business, regulatory investigations, audits by taxing authorities, or enforcement proceedings, and claims by persons whose employment has been terminated. Such matters are subject to many uncertainties, and outcomes are not predictable with assurance. Consequently, management is unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability, amounts which may be covered by insurance or recoverable from third parties, or the financial impact with respect to such matters as of December 31, 2024. However, based on management’s knowledge as of December 31, 2024, management believes that the final resolution of these matters known at such date, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Employment Contracts 
The Company has entered into severance agreements with certain employees and officers. The Company may be required to pay severance and accelerate the vesting of certain equity awards in the event of involuntary terminations.

Convertible Senior Notes and Capped Call Transactions
In March 2021, the Company issued $
400.0
 million aggregate principal amount of 
0.25
% convertible senior notes in a private placement, including $
50.0
 million aggregate principal amount of such notes pursuant to the exercise in full of the over-allotment options of the initial purchasers (collectively, the "Convertible Senior Notes"). The Convertible Senior Notes will mature on March 15, 2026, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. The total net proceeds from the offering, after deducting debt issuance costs, paid by the Company, were approximately $
388.6
 million. The Company used approximately $
39.0
 million of the net proceeds from the offering to pay for the Capped Call Transactions (as described below). 
The Convertible Senior Notes are senior, unsecured obligations and are (i) equal in right of payment with the existing and future senior, unsecured indebtedness; (ii) senior in right of payment to any of the Company’s future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the Convertible Senior Notes; (iii) effectively subordinated to the Company’s existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness, including amounts outstanding under the Loan Agreement or the new Credit Agreement (see section below); and (iv) structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, and (to the extent the Company is not a holder thereof) preferred equity, if any, of the Company’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Convertible Senior Notes.
94
Table of Contents
The Convertible Senior Notes accrue interest at 
0.25
% per annum payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2021. The Convertible Senior Notes will mature on March 15, 2026 unless they are redeemed, repurchased or converted prior to such date. The Convertible Senior Notes are convertible at the option of holders only during certain periods and upon satisfaction of certain conditions. 
Holders have the right to convert their notes (or any portion of a note in an authorized denomination), in the following circumstances: (i) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on June 30, 2021, if the last reported sale price per share of the Company’s common stock exceeds 
130
% of the conversion price for each of at least 
20
 trading days during the 
30
 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; (ii) during the 
five
 consecutive business days immediately after any 
ten
 consecutive trading day period (such 
ten
 consecutive trading day period, the "measurement period") in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 
98
% of the product of the last reported sale price per share of the Company’s common stock on such trading day and the conversion rate on such trading day; (iii) upon the occurrence of certain corporate events or distributions on the Company’s common stock; (iv) if the Company calls such Convertible Senior Notes for redemption; and (v) on or after September 15, 2025, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, holders of the Convertible Senior Notes may, at their option, convert all or a portion of their Convertible Senior Notes regardless of the foregoing conditions at any time from, and including, September 15, 2025 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. 
Upon conversion, the Convertible Senior Notes may be settled in shares of the Company’s common stock, cash or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s common stock, at the Company’s election. All conversions with a conversion date that occurs on or after September 15, 2025 will be settled using the same settlement method, and the Company will send notice of such settlement method to noteholders no later than the open of business on September 15, 2025.
Subject to the terms of the indenture agreement, the Company has the right, at its election, to redeem all, or any portion (subject to the partial redemption limitation) in an authorized denomination, of the Convertible Senior Notes, at any time, and from time to time, on a redemption date on or after March 20, 2024 and on or before the 
40
th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, for cash, but only if the "last reported sale price," as defined under the Offering Memorandum, per share of common stock exceeds 
130
% of the “conversion price” on (i) each of at least 
20
 trading days, during the 
30
 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately before the date the Company sends the related redemption notice; and (ii) the trading day immediately before the date the Company sends such notice. In addition, calling any note for redemption will constitute a "make-whole fundamental change" (as defined below) with respect to that note, in which case the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of that note will be increased in certain circumstances if it is converted after it is called for redemption. If the Company elects to redeem less than all of the outstanding notes, then the redemption will not constitute a make-whole fundamental change with respect to the notes not called for redemption, and holders of the notes not called for redemption will not be entitled to an increased conversion rate for such notes as described above on account of the redemption, except to the limited extent described further below. No sinking fund is provided for the Convertible Senior Notes, which means that the Company is not required to redeem or retire the Convertible Senior Notes periodically.
If a fundamental change occurs, then each noteholder will have the right to require the Company to repurchase its notes (or any portion thereof in an authorized denomination) for cash on a date (the "fundamental change repurchase date") of the Company’s choosing, which must be a business day that is no more than 
45
, nor less than 
20
, business days after the date the Company distributes the related fundamental change notice.
If an event of default, other than a reporting default remedied by special interest as defined in the indenture agreement, occurs with respect to the Company or any guarantor, then the principal amount of, and all accrued and unpaid interest on, all of the notes then outstanding will immediately become due and payable without any further action or notice by any person. If an event of default (other than a reporting event of default described above with respect to the Company or any guarantor and not solely with respect to a significant subsidiary of the Company’s or a guarantor, other than the Company or such guarantor) occurs and is continuing, then, the trustee, by notice to the Company, or noteholders of at least 
25
% of the aggregate principal amount of notes then outstanding, by written notice to the Company and the trustee, may declare the principal amount of, and all accrued and unpaid interest on, all of the notes then outstanding to become due and payable immediately.
The Convertible Senior Notes have an initial conversion rate of 15.6539 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Senior Notes, which will be subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments in certain circumstances. 
In connection with the pricing of the Convertible Senior Notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with various financial institutions (the "Capped Call Transactions"). The Capped Call Transactions were entered into with third party broker-dealers to limit the potential dilution that would occur if the Company has to settle the conversion value in excess of the principal in shares. This exposure will be covered (i.e., the Company will receive as many shares as are required to be 
95
Table of Contents
issued between the conversion price of $
63.8818
 and the maximum price of $
91.2600
). Any shares required to be issued by the Company over this amount would have net earnings per share dilution impact. By entering into the Capped Call Transactions, the Company expects to reduce the potential dilution to its common stock (or, in the event the conversion is settled in cash, to reduce its cash payment obligation) in the event that at the time of conversion its stock price exceeds the conversion price under the Convertible Senior Notes. The Company paid $
39.0
 million for the Capped Call Transactions, which was recorded as additional paid-in capital, using a portion of the gross proceeds from the sale of the Convertible Senior Notes. The cost of the Capped Call Transactions is not expected to be tax deductible as the Company did not elect to integrate the capped call into the Convertible Senior Notes for tax purposes. The cost of the Capped Call Transaction was recorded as a reduction of the Company’s additional paid-in capital in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
The Company incurred debt issuance costs of $
11.4
 million in March 2021. The Convertible Senior Notes are presented net of issuance costs on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The debt issuance costs are amortized on an effective interest basis over the term of the Convertible Senior Notes and are included in interest expense and amortization of debt discount in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. 
During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company repurchased its Convertible Senior Notes in the open market with cash on hand for $
165.5
 million. The Company recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of $
26.5
 million related to the repurchase of $
194.9
 million of principal balance of Convertible Senior Notes and $
2.9
 million of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the extinguished debt during the year ended December 31, 2023. The gain on extinguishment is included in other (income) expense in the Company's consolidated statement of operations.

Credit Agreements
On April 30, 2021, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the "2021 Credit Agreement") with Goldman Sachs Bank USA as administrative agent and collateral agent, and other lender parties thereto. The 2021 Credit Agreement provided for a $
360.0
 million 
seven-year
 senior secured term loan facility ("2021 Term Loan B Facility"), which had a maturity in April 2028, and a $
65.0
 million senior secured revolving credit facility (as amended in June 2021, the "2021 Revolving Credit Facility"), which had a maturity in December 2025. In June 2023, the Company amended the 2021 Credit Agreement (the "Amended 2021 Credit Agreement") to transition away from a variable interest rate based on the Eurodollar Rate towards a similar variable interest rate based on Adjusted Term SOFR, as defined in the Amended 2021 Credit Agreement, which is based on the secured overnight financing rate ("SOFR").
Amounts outstanding under the Amended 2021 Credit Agreement accrue interest at a rate equal to either, (1) for the 2021 Term Loan B Facility, at the Company’s election, the Adjusted Term SOFR plus a margin of 
5.00
% per annum, or ABR (as defined in the Amended 2021 Credit Agreement) plus a margin of 
4.00
%, and (2) for the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility, at the Company’s election, the Adjusted Term SOFR plus a margin of 
4.25
% to 
4.75
%, or ABR plus a margin of 
3.25

On February 6, 2024, the Company refinanced its credit agreement whereby it entered into a new credit agreement (the "2024 Credit Agreement") with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. as the Company term loan administrative agent and Citibank, 
96
Table of Contents
N.A. as the Company's revolving facility administrative agent and collateral agent, and other lender parties thereto. The 2024 Credit Agreement included a $
365.0
 million 
seven-year
 senior secured term loan facility (the "2024 Term Loan B Facility"), whose loans will mature in February 2031 and a $
175.0
 million 
five-year
 senior secured revolving credit facility (the "2024 Revolving Credit Facility"), which will mature in February 2029. The Company primarily used the proceeds from the 2024 Term Loan B Facility to repay in full all outstanding amounts owed under the Company's Amended 2021 Credit Agreement. Accordingly, the Amended 2021 Credit Agreement was terminated and replaced in its entirety. The obligations under the 2024 Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company.
Amounts outstanding under the 2024 Credit Agreement accrue interest at a rate equal to either, (1) for the 2024 Term Loan B Facility, at the Company’s election, Term SOFR (as defined in the 2024 Credit Agreement) plus a margin of 
4.50
% per annum, or ABR (as defined in the 2024 Credit Agreement) plus a margin of 
3.50
%, and (2) for the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility, at the Company’s election, Term SOFR plus a margin of 
3.50
% to 
4.00
%, or ABR plus a margin of 
2.50
% to 
3.00
%, in each case, depending on the Company’s First Lien Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2024 Credit Agreement).
On September 18, 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to the 2024 Credit Agreement ("Amendment No. 1"), which reduced the interest rate of the 2024 Term Loan B Facility by 
75
 basis points to Term SOFR plus a margin of 
3.75
%, from the previous rate of Term SOFR plus a margin of 
4.50
%. Amendment No. 1 also reduced the interest rate margin of any ABR Loans (as defined in Amendment No. 1) by 
75
 basis points to ABR plus a margin of 
2.75
% from the previous rate of ABR plus a margin of 
3.50
%. The remaining terms of the 2024 Term Loan B Facility and 2024 Revolving Credit Facility were substantially unchanged.
As of December 31, 2024, the contractual interest rate related to the Term Loan B Facility was 
8.11
%. In addition to having to pay contractual interest on the 2024 Term Loan B Facility, the Company is also required to pay certain other fees, primarily to the lenders under the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility, in order to maintain their revolving facility commitments.
The covenants of the 2024 Credit Agreement include customary negative covenants that, among other things, restrict the Company’s ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens and make certain acquisitions, investments, asset dispositions and restricted payments. In addition, the 2024 Credit Agreement contains a springing financial covenant that is tested on the last day of any fiscal quarter only if utilization of the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility exceeds 
35
% of the total revolving commitments, whereby the Company is required to maintain a First Lien Net Leverage Ratio below 
3.25
 to 1.00. As of December 31, 2024, 
no
 amounts were outstanding under the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility and the Company was in compliance with its debt covenants. At December 31, 2024, amounts available under the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility were $
169.8
 million, net of letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $
5.2
 million.
The 2024 Credit Agreement includes customary events of default, and customary rights and remedies upon the occurrence of any event of default thereunder, including rights to accelerate the loans, terminate the commitments thereunder and realize upon the collateral securing the obligations under the 2024 Credit Agreement. The 2024 Credit Agreement calls for customary scheduled loan amortization payments of 
0.25
% of the initial principal balance, which at the time of Amendment No. 1 was $
364.1
 million, payable quarterly (i.e. 
1
% in aggregate per year) as well as a provision that requires the Company to prepay the 2024 Term Loan B Facility based on an annual calculation of free cash flow ("Excess Cash Flow") as defined by the 2024 Credit Agreement. The Company was not required to make any such mandatory prepayment required by the Excess Cash Flow provision for the period ended December 31, 2024.
The following table summarizes the amount outstanding under the Company's 2024 Term Loan B Facility and 2021 Term Loan B Facility as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:

February 6, 2024 Debt Refinance
As part of the debt refinance on February 6, 2024, where lenders under the 2021 Credit Agreement continued to be lenders under the 2024 Credit Agreement, certain of their loans and revolving facility commitments were deemed to have been modified 
97
Table of Contents
("Modified Loans" and "Modified Commitments," respectively). The Company continued to defer debt discount costs of $
3.7
 million and debt issuance costs of $
5.7
 million from Modified Loans over the term of the new 2024 Term Loan B Facility. The Company continued to defer financing costs as of February 6, 2024 of an 
immaterial
 amount from Modified Commitments over the term of the new 2024 Revolver Facility.
For lenders of the 2021 Credit Agreement that did not continue to participate in the 2024 Credit Agreement, their pro-rata portion of the unamortized debt discount of $
2.8
 million, unamortized debt issuance costs of $
4.3
 million, and an 
immaterial
 amount of unamortized deferred financing costs were deemed to be extinguished. The resulting loss on extinguishment of debt of $
7.4
 million is included in other (income) expense in the Company's consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024.
The Company paid $
7.7
 million in third-party fees related to the closing of the 2024 Credit Agreement. Third-party fees attributed to new lenders of $
2.4
 million were capitalized as part of the debt issuance costs and will be amortized over the term of the 2024 Term Loan B Facility while third-party fees attributed to Modified Loans of $
3.1
 million were included in general and administrative expenses in the Company's consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024. In addition, third-party fees of $
2.1
 million attributed to new revolving lenders and Modified Commitments were capitalized as part of deferred financing costs and will be amortized over the term of the 2024 Revolving Facility. The Company also capitalized additional debt discount costs of $
3.7
 million associated with the closing of the 2024 Term Loan B Facility, which will be amortized over the term of the 2024 Term Loan B Facility.
September 18, 2024 Debt Repricing
The Company analyzed the changes of Amendment No. 1 on a lender-by-lender basis and determined that the transaction would primarily be accounted for as a modification, with a portion of it accounted for as debt extinguishment and new debt issuance. As a result, the Company recognized an 
immaterial
 loss on extinguishment related to unamortized debt discount and unamortized debt issuance costs related to the portion of the 2024 Term Loan B Facility that was extinguished. The Company paid $
1.0
 million in third-party fees related to Amendment No. 1 of which an 
immaterial
 amount was capitalized as debt issuance costs and $
1.0
 million was included in general and administrative expenses in the Company's consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024. As part of Amendment No. 1, most lenders decided to roll their loan balances over from the original 2024 Term Loan B Facility to the amended 2024 Term Loan B Facility, while some decided to cash out and reassign their loan balances. On September 18, 2024, $
312.0
 million of the 2024 Term Loan B Facility principal balance was rolled over as part of non-cash financing activities while $
52.1
 million of the 2024 Term Loan B Facility principal balance was repaid and then reissued.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
    Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives of ensuring that information we are required to disclose in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures, and is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. There is no assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures will operate effectively under all circumstances. Based upon the evaluation described above, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

    Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
    There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
    Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act). 
Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in "Internal Control - Integrated Framework" (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. Deloitte & Touche LLP has independently assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and its report is included herein.

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 

    Management recognizes that a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud or error, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Magnite, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Magnite, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) 
issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 26, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
