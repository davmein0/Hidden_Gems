Item 3. Legal Proceedings
We and our subsidiaries may from time to time be parties to legal or regulatory proceedings, lawsuits and other claims incident to our business activities and to our status as a public company. Such routine matters may include, among other things, assertions of contract breach or intellectual property infringement, claims for indemnity arising in the course of our business, regulatory investigations, audits by taxing authorities, or enforcement proceedings, and claims by persons whose employment has been terminated. Such matters are subject to many uncertainties, and outcomes are not predictable with assurance. Consequently, we are unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability, amounts which may be covered by insurance or recoverable from third parties, or the financial impact with respect to such matters as of December 31, 2024. However, based on our knowledge as of December 31, 2024, we believe that the final resolution of such matters pending at the time of this report, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Refer to Note 16—"Commitments and Contingencies" for additional information related to legal proceedings.

 Upon vesting of most restricted stock units or stock awards, we are required to deposit minimum statutory employee withholding taxes on behalf of the holders of the vested awards. As reimbursement for these tax deposits, we have the option to withhold from shares otherwise issuable upon vesting a portion of those shares with a fair market value equal to the amount of the deposits we paid. Withholding of shares in this manner is accounted for as a repurchase of common stock.

 On February 1, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program (the "February 2024 Repurchase Plan") under which the Company is authorized to repurchase common stock or Convertible Senior Notes, with an aggregate market value of up to $125.0 million, through February 1, 2026. Shares repurchased under the February 2024 Repurchase Plan in the quarter ended December 31, 2024 have been subsequently retired, which was recorded as a reduction in additional paid in capital. The average price per share purchased under the February 2024 Repurchase Plan includes broker commission costs. As of December 31, 2024, $110.4 million remains available under the February 2024 Repurchase Plan.

reference into any filing of ours under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
The following graph compares the cumulative total stockholder return on an initial investment of $100 in our common stock between December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2024, with the comparative cumulative total returns of the S&P 500 Index, Nasdaq Composite, Nasdaq Internet Index, S&P Internet Select Industry Index, and Russell 2000 Index over the same period. As previously discussed, we have not paid any cash dividends and, therefore, the cumulative total return calculation for us is based solely upon stock price appreciation (depreciation) and not reinvestment of cash dividends, whereas the data for the comparative indexes assumes reinvestments of dividends. The returns shown are based on historical results and are not necessarily indicative of, nor intended to forecast, future stock price performance.
