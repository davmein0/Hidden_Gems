Item 2. Properties
Our corporate headquarters are located in New York, New York, where we occupy office space totaling approximately 41,946 square feet under a lease that expires in 2030. We use these facilities for our principal administration, sales and marketing, technology and development, and engineering activities. 
We also have an office in Los Angeles under a lease that expires in 2032 that is approximately 38,754 square feet and lease additional offices and maintain data centers in other locations in North America, South America, Europe, Australia, and Asia. We believe that our current facilities are adequate to meet our current needs, and that, if we require additional space, we will be able to obtain additional facilities on commercially reasonable terms.
