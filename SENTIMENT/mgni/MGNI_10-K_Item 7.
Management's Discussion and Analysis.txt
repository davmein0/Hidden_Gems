SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS; SUMMARY OF RISK FACTORS 
This Annual Report on Form 10-K and related statements by the Company contain forward-looking statements, including statements based upon or relating to our expectations, assumptions, estimates, and projections. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as "may," "might," "will," "objective," "intend," "should," "could," "can," "would," "expect," "believe," "design," "anticipate," "estimate," "predict," "potential," "plan" or the negative of these terms, and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements may include, but are not limited to, statements concerning the Company's guidance or expectations with respect to future financial performance; acquisitions by the Company, or the anticipated benefits thereof; macroeconomic conditions or concerns related thereto; the growth of ad-supported programmatic connected television ("CTV"); our ability to use and collect data to provide our offerings; the scope and duration of client relationships; the fees we may charge in the future; key strategic objectives; anticipated benefits of new offerings; business mix; sales growth; benefits from supply path optimization; our ability to adapt to advancements in artificial intelligence; the development of identity solutions; client utilization of our offerings; the impact of requests for discounts, rebates or other fee concessions; our competitive differentiation; our market share and leadership position in the industry; market conditions, trends, and opportunities; certain statements regarding future operational performance measures; and other statements that are not historical facts. These statements are not guarantees of future performance; they reflect our current views with respect to future events and are based on assumptions and estimates and subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from expectations or results projected or implied by forward-looking statements. 
Risks that our business faces include, but are not limited to, the following:
•
the impact of macroeconomic challenges on the overall demand for advertising and the advertising marketplace;
•
we operate in an intensely competitive market that includes companies that have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do;
•
spend on our platform may grow more slowly than we expect, growth may occur disproportionately through platforms or applications that we cannot access, or we may not be able to maintain or increase access to advertising inventory;
•
the freedom of buyers and sellers to direct their spending and inventory to competing sources of inventory and demand, and to establish direct relationships and integrations without the use of our platform;
•
we may be unsuccessful in our supply path optimization efforts with buyers;
•
our ability to introduce new offerings and bring them to market in a timely manner, and potential responses or reactions of clients, vendors, and competitors to the announcement of new products and offerings;
•
uncertainty of our estimates and expectations associated with new offerings; 
•
we must increase the scale and efficiency of our technology infrastructure to support our growth and recent developments in artificial intelligence and machine-learning may accelerate or exacerbate potential risks related to technological developments;
•
the emergence of header bidding has increased competition and may cause infrastructure strain and added costs;
•
our access to mobile inventory may be limited by third-party technology or lack of direct relationships with mobile sellers;
•
we may experience lower take rates, which may not be offset by increases in ad spend;
•
the impact of requests for discounts, fee concessions, rebates, refunds or favorable payment terms;
•
CTV sellers may not adopt or may be slow to adopt programmatic solutions that transact in biddable auction environments;
•
a decline in CPMs for publisher inventory on our platform could lead to a decrease in ad spend;
•
our business may be subject to sales and use tax, advertising and other taxes;
•
our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions;
•
our reliance on large aggregators of advertising inventory, and the concentration of CTV among a small number of large sellers that enjoy significant negotiating leverage with respect to take rates and other terms;
•
our ability to provide value to both buyers and sellers of advertising without being perceived as favoring one over the other or being perceived as competing with them through our service offerings;
•
our reliance on large sources of advertising demand, including demand side platforms ("DSPs") that may have or develop high-risk credit profiles or fail to pay invoices when due;
•
our ability to adapt to advancements in artificial intelligence within the context of the open internet and display advertising;
•
failure by us or our clients to meet advertising and inventory content standards;
•
our sales efforts may require significant time and expense and may not yield the results we seek;
•
we may be exposed to claims from clients for breach of contract;
•
the effects of seasonal trends on our results of operations;

•
the effects of consolidation in the ad tech industry or among our publisher clients;
•
our ability to differentiate our offerings and compete effectively to combat commodification and disintermediation;
•
potential limitations on our ability to collect or use data as a result of consumer tools, regulatory restrictions and technological limitations;
•
the deprecation of third-party cookies and other identifiers, and the development of new targeting and identity solutions, may disrupt the programmatic ecosystem, cause reduced CPMs and fill rates, result in a shift of ad spend towards "walled gardens," require additional investment and resources, and cause the overall performance of our platform to decline;
•
the industry may not adopt or may be slow to adopt the use of first-party publisher segments as an alternative to third-party cookies;
•
the impact of antitrust regulations or enforcement actions targeting the digital advertising ecosystem;
•
our ability to comply with, and the effect on our business of, evolving legal standards and regulations, particularly concerning data protection and privacy; 
•
evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations and expectations, including with respect to cyber security, environmental, social and governance matters;
•
errors or failures in the operation of our solution, interruptions in our access to network infrastructure or data, and breaches of our computer systems including as a result of cyber security incidents;
•
our ability to ensure a high level of brand safety for our clients and to detect "bot" traffic and other fraudulent or malicious activity;
•
our ability to attract and retain qualified employees and key personnel;
•
costs associated with enforcing our intellectual property rights or defending intellectual property infringement;
•
our ability to comply with the terms of our financing arrangements; 
•
restrictions in our Credit Agreement may limit our ability to make strategic investments, respond to changing market conditions, or otherwise operate our business;
•
increases in our debt leverage may put us at greater risk of defaulting on our debt obligations, subject us to additional operating restrictions and make it more difficult to obtain future financing on favorable terms;
•
conversion of our Convertible Senior Notes would dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders;
•
the Capped Call Transactions subject us to counterparty risk and may affect the value of the Convertible Senior Notes and our common stock;
•
the conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Senior Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating result;
•
failure to successfully execute our international growth plans;
•
failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, which could adversely affect investor confidence;
•
the use of our net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to certain limitations;
•
our ability to raise additional capital if needed;
•
volatility in the price of our common stock;
•
the impact of our repurchase program on our stock price and cash reserves;
•
competition for investors and the impact of negative analyst or investor research reports; and
•
provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may inhibit a potential acquisition of the company and limit the ability of stockholders to cause changes in company management.
We discuss many of these risks and additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by our forward-looking statements under the headings "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," and elsewhere in this report and in other filings we have made and will make from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. These forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of the report in which they are included. Unless required by federal securities laws, we assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements, or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated, to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the statements are made. Without limiting the foregoing, any guidance we may provide will generally be given only in connection with quarterly and annual earnings announcements, without interim updates, and we may appear at industry conferences or make other public statements without disclosing material nonpublic information in our possession. Given these uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.
