GLOSSARY

As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this “Form 10-K”), the terms identified below have the meanings specified below unless otherwise noted or the context indicates otherwise. BrightSpring Health Services, Inc. conducts its operations through its subsidiaries, including its indirect subsidiaries, BrightSpring Health Holdings Corp. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, ResCare, Inc., and PharMerica Corporation, or PharMerica. As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless otherwise stated or the context requires otherwise, the terms “BrightSpring,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to BrightSpring Health Services, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.

“ABA” means applied behavioral analysis, a type of therapy that focuses on improving specific behaviors; 
•
“ABI/TBI” means acquired/traumatic brain injury; 
•
“Abode” means Abode Healthcare, which we acquired in April 2021; 
•
“associated family satisfaction,” for circumstances when a patient is unable to respond due to cognitive issues, is calculated by the percentage of such family member of a patient who would recommend the Company to another friend or family member based on the patient’s experience in the Company’s therapy, as reported in our outpatient therapy satisfaction survey from April 1, 2023 to June 30, 2023; 
•
“Behavioral” patients and populations mean individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities including mental illness; 
•
“BHS Acquisition” means the acquisition of BrightSpring Health Holdings Corp. and its subsidiaries in March 2019; 
•
“BrightSpring,” “BrightSpring Health Services,” “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to BrightSpring Health Services, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries;
•
“de novo” means new branch, agency, facility, clinic, and pharmacy locations;
•
“First Lien Facilities” mean, collectively, the First Lien Term Loan Facility, the Revolving Credit Facility, and the LC Facility; 
•
“First Lien Term Loan Facility” means, collectively, the Initial Term Loans, the Tranche B-2 Term Loans, the Tranche B-3 Term Loans, the Tranche B-4 Term Loans, and the Tranche B-5 Term Loans, which are collectively described under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Debt”; 
•
“HCI” means Hospice Care Index, which captures care processes occurring throughout the hospice stay. The HCI is a single measure comprising ten indicators calculated from Medicare claims data. Each indicator equally affects the single HCI score, reflecting the equal importance of each aspect of care delivered from admission to discharge. The HCI score does not have a traditional numerator or denominator. Instead, a hospice, assuming 20 or more discharges in the two pooled years of data, is awarded a point for meeting each criterion for each of the ten claims-based indicators. The sum of the points earned from meeting the criterion of each individual indicator results in the hospice’s HCI score. HCI scores can range from 0 to a perfect 10; 
•
“I/DD” means an intellectual/developmental or cognitive disability;
•
“independent” when (i) describing independent provider of home and community-based health services means non-hospital providers that are not associated with a payor and (ii) describing independent platform of pharmacy services or independent specialty pharmacy means non-retail pharmacies that are not associated with a payor;

“LC Facility” means our letter of credit facility, as described under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Debt”;
•
“MPR” means Medication Possession Ratio, which is the most commonly used measure of adherence. MPR is calculated as the ratio of the number of days a patient is stocked for their medication to the number of days a patient should be stocked for their medication. We often use MPR to measure pharmacy performance. A performance measure over 80% is considered compliant under our contracts with a payor; 
•
“neuro” patients and populations mean individuals who have acquired a traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, pediatric autism, or other neurological condition;

•
“NPS” represents Net Promoter Score, which is a metric used to gauge patient satisfaction based on how likely a patient or physician would be to recommend a company to a friend or colleague. The question is measured on a scale of 0 (not at all likely) to 10 (extremely likely). A designation of “Promoter” is assigned to respondents who provide a score of 9 or 10, a designation of “Passive” is assigned to respondents who provide a score of 7 or 8, and a designation of “Detractor” is assigned to respondents who provide a score of 0 to 6. NPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of Detractors from Promoters. NPS ranges from -100 to +100, and scores that are closer to +100 indicate that there are more Promoters overall, and a score of +100 indicates that there are no Detractors or Passives. We utilize a third party consulting service, MMIT, to conduct our own NPS surveys of patients served by us and referring physicians in our network. MMIT, as well as other industry standards such as Qualtrics, have indicated that a score above 50 is “excellent” and a score above 80 is “world class.” Throughout this Annual Report, we reference multiple NPS, as the underlying surveys are conducted by us or by third parties, including payers, across different constituents, both patients and referring physicians, as well as across various time periods, generally conducted quarterly;

•
“patient satisfaction” is calculated (i) for purposes of Company’s outpatient rehab services, by the percentage of patients who are satisfied or very satisfied with the progress they have made with the therapy treatment while on our services, as reported in our outpatient therapy satisfaction survey from April 1, 2023 to June 30, 2023; and (ii) for purposes of infusion scores, by averaging the results of seven quality measures, supplies, staff general communication, staff courtesy, staff helpfulness, staff instruction effectiveness, overall satisfaction, and willingness to recommend, as reported in our home infusion satisfaction survey from April 1, 2023 to June 30, 2023; 
•
“Revolving Credit Facility” means our senior secured revolving credit facility, as described under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Debt”; 
•
“Second Lien Facility” means our senior secured second lien term loan facility, as described under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Debt”; 
•
“Senior” patients and populations mean individuals who are aged 65 and older; 
•
“Specialty” patients and populations mean individuals who have unique, specialized and most often chronic/life-long health conditions and needs; 
•

Our expectations, beliefs, and projections are expressed in good faith and we believe there is a reasonable basis for them. However, there can be no assurance that management’s expectations, beliefs, and projections will result or be achieved.

We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions, or expectations disclosed in our forward- looking statements and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Our forward- looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers, dispositions, joint ventures, investments, or other strategic transactions we may make. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by any applicable securities laws.

MARKET AND INDUSTRY DATA
This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains estimates, projections and other information concerning our industry and our business, including data regarding the estimated size of the market, projected growth rates and perceptions and preferences of customers, that we have prepared based on industry publications, reports and other independent sources, each of which is either publicly available without charge or available on a subscription fee basis. None of such information was prepared specifically for us in connection with this filing. Some data also is based on our good faith estimates, which are derived from management’s knowledge of the industry and from independent sources. These third-party publications and surveys generally state that the information included therein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but that the publications and surveys can give no assurance as to the accuracy or completeness of such information. Market and industry data is subject to variations and cannot be verified due to limits on the availability and reliability of data inputs, the voluntary nature of the data gathering process and other limitations and uncertainties inherent in any statistical survey. Although we are responsible for all of the disclosures contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and we believe the industry and market data included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is reliable, we have not independently verified any of the data from third-party sources nor have we ascertained the underlying economic assumptions on which such data is based. Similarly, we believe our internal research is reliable, even though such research has not been verified by any independent sources. The industry and market data included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K involve a number of assumptions and limitations, and you are cautioned not to give undue weight to such information.

Unless otherwise expressly stated, we obtained industry, business, market and other data from the reports, publications and other materials and sources listed below. In some cases, we do not expressly refer to the sources from which this data is derived. In that regard, when we refer to one or more sources of this type of data in any paragraph, you should assume that other data of this type appearing in the same paragraph is derived from the same sources, unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires.
