Overview
Marqeta’s mission is modernizing financial services by making the entire payment experience native and delightful. Marqeta’s modern platform empowers our customers to create customized and innovative payment card programs with configurability and flexibility. Marqeta’s open APIs provide instant access to highly scalable, cloud-based payment infrastructure that enables customers to embed the payments experience into apps or websites for a personalized user experience. Customers can launch and manage their own card programs, issue cards, and authorize and settle payment transactions quickly using our platform. We also deliver robust card program management, allowing our customers to embed Marqeta in their offering without having to build certain complex compliance elements or customer support services.
Marqeta’s innovative products are developed with deep domain expertise and a customer-first mindset to launch, scale, and manage card programs. Marqeta provides all of its customers with issuer processor services, and for most of its customers it also acts as a card program manager. Depending on a customer’s desired level of control and responsibility, Marqeta can work with companies in a range of different configurations, but generally provides the following offerings:
•
Managed By Marqeta: With Managed By Marqeta, Marqeta typically connects customers to an Issuing Bank partner to act as the BIN sponsor for the customer’s card program, manages the customer’s card program on behalf of the Issuing Bank, and provides a full range of services including configuring many of the critical resources required by a customer’s production environment. In addition to providing the customer access to the Marqeta dashboard via our APIs, Marqeta also manages a number of the primary tasks related to launching a card program, such as defining and managing the program with the Card Networks and Issuing Bank, operating the program and managing certain profitability components, and managing compliance with applicable regulations, the Issuing Bank, and Card Network rules. Also available are a variety of managed services, including dispute management, fraud scoring, card fulfillment, reconciliation, and cardholder support services.
•
Powered By Marqeta: With Powered By Marqeta, Marqeta also provides customers access to the Marqeta dashboard via our APIs, provides payment processing, and assists with certain configuration elements that enable the customer to use the platform independently. Generally, our PxM customers are responsible for other elements of the card program, including defining and managing the program with the Card Networks and Issuing Bank as well as managing compliance with applicable regulations, the Issuing Bank, and Card Network rules.
Given the modularity of the Marqeta platform, certain customers can also opt to incorporate some elements of MxM into their card program to create a custom solution. Many customers adopt some combination of the MxM managed services even when not adopting the full MxM offering.

Impact of Macroeconomic Factors
We are unable to predict the impact macroeconomic factors, including various geopolitical conflicts, uncertainty related to global elections, changes in inflation and interest rates, and uncertainty in global economic conditions, will have on our processing volumes and on our future results of operations. A deterioration in macroeconomic conditions could increase the risk of lower consumer spending, consumer and merchant bankruptcy, insolvency, business failure, higher credit losses, foreign currency fluctuations, or other business interruption, which may adversely impact our business. We continue to monitor these situations and may take actions that alter our operations and business practices as may be required by federal, state, or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our customers, vendors, and employees. 
See the section titled “Risk Factors” under Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the possible impact of these macroeconomic factors on our business

Key Operating Metric and Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We review a number of operating and financial metrics, including the key operating metric set forth below, to help us evaluate our business and growth trends, establish budgets, evaluate the effectiveness of our investments, and assess operational efficiencies. In addition to the results determined in accordance with GAAP, the following table sets forth a key operating metric and non-GAAP financial measures that we consider useful in evaluating our operating performance.

Total Processing Volume (“TPV”)
 - 
TPV represents the total dollar amount of payments processed through our platform, net of returns and chargebacks. We believe that TPV is a key operating metric and a principal indicator of the market adoption of our platform, growth of our brand, growth of our customers' businesses and scale of our business.
Adjusted EBITDA
 - 
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that is calculated as Net income (loss) adjusted to exclude depreciation and amortization; share-based compensation expense;  executive chairman long-term performance award; payroll tax related to share-based compensation; restructuring charges; acquisition related expenses which consist of due diligence costs, transaction costs and integration costs related to potential or successful acquisitions and cash and non-cash postcombination compensation expenses; income tax expense (benefit); and other income, net, which consists of interest income from our short-term investments, realized foreign currency gains and losses, our share of equity method investments’ profit or loss, impairment of equity method investments or other financial instruments, and gain from sale of equity method investments. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure of operating performance because it allows management and our board of directors to evaluate and compare our core operating results, including our operating efficiencies, from period to period. Additionally, we utilize Adjusted EBITDA as an input into our calculation of our annual employee bonus plans and performance-based restricted stock units. See the section below titled “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a discussion of the use of non-GAAP measures, a change in presentation, and a reconciliation of Net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA.
Adjusted EBITDA Margin
 - 
Adjusted EBITDA Margin is a non-GAAP financial measure that is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Net revenue. This measure is used by management and our board of directors to evaluate our operating efficiency. See the section below titled “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a discussion of the use of non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation of Net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA Margin.
Non-GAAP operating expenses
 - 
Non-GAAP operating expenses is a non-GAAP financial measure that is calculated as Total operating expenses adjusted to exclude depreciation and amortization; share-based compensation expense; executive chairman long-term performance award; payroll tax related to share-based compensation; restructuring charges; and acquisition-related expenses which consists of due diligence costs, transaction cost and integration costs related to potential or successful acquisitions, and cash and non-cash postcombination compensation expenses. We believe that non-GAAP operating expenses is an important measure of operating performance because it allows management and our board of directors to evaluate and compare our core operating results, including our operating efficiencies, from period to period. See the section below titled “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a discussion of the use of non-GAAP measures, a change in presentation, and a reconciliation of total operation expenses to non-GAAP operating expenses.

Components of Results of Operations
Net Revenue
We have two components of net revenue: platform services revenue, net and other services revenue.
Platform services revenue, net
.

Platform services revenue includes Interchange Fees, net of Revenue Share and other service-level payments to customers, and Card Network and Issuing Bank costs for certain customer arrangements where the Company is an agent in the delivery of services to the customer. Platform services revenue also includes processing and other fees. “Interchange Fees” are transaction-based and volume-based fees set by a Card Network and paid by a merchant bank to the Issuing Bank that issued the payment card used to purchase goods or services from a merchant. The Company earns Interchange Fees on card transactions we process for our customers and are based on a percentage of the transaction amount plus a fixed amount per transaction. Interchange Fees are recognized when the associated transactions are settled.
“Revenue Share” payments are incentives to our customers to increase their processing volumes on our platform. Revenue Share is generally computed as a percentage of the Interchange Fees earned or processing volume and is paid to our MxM customers monthly. Revenue Share payments are recorded as a reduction to net revenue. Generally, as customers' processing volumes increase, the rates at which we share revenue increase.
Processing and other fees are priced as either a percentage of processing volume or on a fee per transaction basis and are earned when payment cards are used at automated teller machines or to make cross-border purchases. Minimum processing fees, where customers' processing volumes fall below certain thresholds, are also included in processing and other fees.
We recognize revenue when the promised services are complete, and our performance obligations are satisfied. Platform services are considered complete when we have authorized the transaction, validated that the transaction has no errors, and accepted and posted the data to our records. 
Other services revenue.
 Other services revenue primarily consists of revenue earned for card fulfillment services. Card fulfillment fees are generally billed to customers upon ordering card inventory and recognized as revenue when the cards are shipped to the customers.
Costs of Revenue
Costs of revenue consist of Card Network fees, Issuing Bank fees, and card fulfillment costs for customer arrangements where the Company is the principal in providing services to the customer and excludes depreciation and amortization, which is reported separately within the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). Card Network fees are equal to a specified percentage of processing volume or a fixed amount per transaction routed through the respective Card Network. Issuing Bank fees compensate our Issuing Banks for issuing cards to our customers and sponsoring our card programs with the Card Networks and are typically equal to a specified percentage of processing volume or a fixed amount per transaction. Card fulfillment costs include physical cards, packaging, and other fulfillment costs.
We have separate marketing and incentive arrangements with Card Networks that provide us with monetary incentives for establishing customer card programs with, and routing volume through, the respective Card Network. The amount of the incentives is generally determined based on a percentage of the processing volume or the number of transactions routed over the Card Network. We record these incentives as a reduction of Card Network fees in customer arrangements where the Company is the principal. Generally, as processing volumes increase, we earn a higher rate of monetary incentives from these arrangements, subject to attaining certain volume thresholds during an annual measurement period. For certain incentive arrangements with an annual measurement period, the one-year period may not align with our fiscal year. 
52
Table of Contents
We record network incentives in the period we attain the contractual volume thresholds, given the uncertainty in the ultimate annual attainment of incentives. As such, unusual fluctuations in Card Network fees can occur in the quarter in which volume thresholds are attained as higher incentive rates are applied to volumes over the entire measurement periods, which can span six or twelve months. Generally, we earn a higher rate of monetary incentives during the first quarter of our fiscal year, as the annual measurement period is closest to completion and higher volume thresholds have been reached. In the second quarter of the fiscal year, we generally earn the lowest rate of monetary incentives, as the annual measurement period and volume thresholds have reset.
As we continue to enhance our processes and improve our ability to estimate these annual incentives with increasing precision, the fluctuation in recognition of these network incentives throughout the year is expected to diminish.
Operating Expenses (Benefit)
Compensation and Benefits. 
Compensation and benefits consist primarily of salaries, employee benefits, severance and other termination benefits, incentive compensation, contractors’ cost, and share-based compensation.
Technology. 
Technology consists primarily of third-party hosting fees, software licenses, and hardware purchases below our capitalization threshold, and support and maintenance costs.
Professional Services. 
Professional services consist primarily of consulting, legal, audit, and recruiting fees.
Occupancy. 
Occupancy consists primarily of rent expense, repairs, maintenance, and other building related costs.
Depreciation and Amortization. 
Depreciation and amortization consist primarily of depreciation of our fixed assets and amortization of capitalized internal-use software and developed technology intangible assets.
Marketing and Advertising. 
Marketing and advertising consist primarily of costs of general marketing and promotional activities.

Other Operating Expenses. 
Other operating expenses consist primarily of insurance costs, indemnification costs, travel-related expenses, indirect state and local taxes, and other general office expenses.
Executive Chairman Long-Term Performance Award.
 Executive Chairman Long-Term Performance Award consists of share-based compensation related to the Executive Chairman’s Long-Term Performance Award, including the impact of forfeiture. The Executive Chairman Long-Term Performance Award was forfeited in the current year as a result of the Company’s Executive Chairman transitioning to a non-employee director role on the board of directors. 
Other Income, net
Other income, net consists primarily of interest income from our short-term investments and cash deposits, gain from sale of equity method investments, impairment of equity method investments or other financial instruments, equity method investment share of loss, and realized foreign currency gains and losses.
Income Tax Expense (Benefit)
Income tax expense (benefit) consists of U.S. federal and state income taxes, and income taxes related to certain foreign jurisdictions. We maintain a full valuation allowance against our U.S. federal and state net deferred tax assets as we have concluded that it is not more likely than not that we will realize our net deferred tax assets.

Total net revenue decreased by $169.2 million, or 25%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, of which $221.5 million was attributable to our largest customer, Block. The decrease in net revenue was primarily driven by the August 2023 Block Amendment which allowed for reduced pricing and impacted the revenue presentation for the Cash App program as fees owed to Issuing Banks and Card Networks related to the Cash App primary Card Network volume are recorded as a reduction to the revenue earned from the Cash App program within Net revenue effective as of July 1, 2023. In prior periods, these costs were included within Costs of revenue. The impact of these fees for the year ended December 31, 2024 was a $264.7 million reduction to Net revenue, negatively impacting the growth rate by 39 ppts. These decreases in net revenue were partially offset by increased TPV from Block’s programs. Net revenue from other customers increased $52.4 million primarily driven by an increase in TPV partially offset by the impact of contract renewals and unfavorable changes in the mix of our card programs, particularly the growth of our PxM offering.
Other services revenue increased $3.7 million, or 17%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. This growth was driven by a rise in card-related fulfillments, which included both one-time replacements and an overall increase in customer card shipments compared to the prior period. 
The increase in TPV was mainly driven by growth across all our major verticals, particularly financial services, and PxM customers. The growth in TPV for our top five customers, as determined by their individual processing volume in each respective period, was 24% for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. This growth was mirrored by a 67% increase in TPV from all other customers for the same period. Note that the top five customers may differ between the two periods.

Costs of revenue decreased by $191.5 million, or 55%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the revenue presentation change for our fees owed to Issuing Banks and Card Networks related to the Cash App primary Card Network volume which are now reflected within net revenue as a result of the August 2023 Block Amendment. In

addition, the Company realized improved economics with the Issuing Banks with which we work. These decreases were partially offset by increases in Issuing Bank and Card Network fees driven by TPV growth. 
As a result of the decreases in costs of revenue being less than the decreases in net revenue explained above, our gross profit increased by $22.3 million, or 7%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. Our gross margin increased to 69% during the year ended December 31, 2024 from 49% during the year ended December 31, 2023.

Salaries, bonus, benefits, and payroll taxes decreased by $57.8 million, or 18%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was largely driven by lower year-over-year postcombination compensation costs to former employees of Power Finance. To a lesser extent, lower year-over-year severance costs related to the restructuring that occurred in 2023, lower average headcount, and an increase in salaries, bonus, and benefits costs capitalized for internal-use software development in 2024 also contributed to the decrease. 
Share-based compensation increased by $9.0 million, or 7%, in the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 mainly due to the increase in the number of RSU awards granted to employees, partially offset by higher share-based compensation capitalized for internal-use development. 
Technology expenses increased by $4.4 million, or 8%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was due to higher software as a service costs to support our continued growth and higher software licensing costs as we implement new internal systems and tools.
Professional services expenses decreased by $1.6 million, or 7%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was due to the lower consulting fees incurred year over year.
56
Table of Contents
Occupancy expense increased by $1.6 million, or 37%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was driven by the $1.4 million impairment of the right-of-use assets associated with the Company's Oakland office.
Depreciation and amortization increased by $6.7 million, or 63%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the amortization of internally developed software as more projects have been capitalized and placed into service.
Marketing and advertising expenses increased by $0.4 million, or 16%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.
Other operating expenses decreased by $1.2 million, or 7%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to cost optimization initiatives in the current year.
Executive chairman long-term performance award decreased for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to a one-time reversal of share-based compensation expense of $167.3 million, of which $144.6 million related to expenses recognized in prior periods, as the Executive Chairman Long-Term Performance Award was forfeited in the current year as a result of the Company’s Executive Chairman transitioning to a non-employee director role on the board of directors.

Other income, net is largely comprised of interest income, and remained relatively flat for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, as higher average yields were largely offset by lower average investment balances. 
Income Tax Expense (Benefit)
We recognized income tax expense of $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to an income tax benefit of $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was primarily attributable to an $8.0 million partial valuation allowance release during 2023 due to the Power Finance acquisition, partially offset by income tax expenses resulting from profitable foreign operations.
Customer Concentration
We generated 47% and 68% of our net revenue from our largest customer, Block, during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation. These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as a substitute for, or superior to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. In evaluating these non-GAAP measures, you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses similar to the adjustments in the presentation of our non-GAAP measures set forth under “Key Operating Metric and Non-GAAP Financial Measures”. There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-GAAP measures versus their most directly comparable GAAP measures, including the following:
•
other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP operating expenses differently than how we calculate this measure or not at all; this reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure;
•
although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditures; and 
•
adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the effect of income taxes that may represent a reduction in cash available to us.
We encourage investors to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

_______________
(1) Prior period amounts related to our Executive Chairman Long-Term Performance Award have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
(2) Restructuring includes a net reduction of $2.9 million of stock-based compensation related to the forfeiture of certain equity awards during the year ended December 31, 2023.
(3) Acquisition-related expenses, which include transaction costs, integration costs, and cash and non-cash postcombination compensation expense, have been excluded from adjusted EBITDA as such expenses are not reflective of our ongoing core operations and are not representative of the ongoing costs necessary to operate our business; instead, these are costs specifically associated with a discrete transaction.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Since our inception through June 30, 2021, we financed our operations primarily through sales of equity securities and payments received from our customers. In June 2021, we completed our IPO in which we received aggregate net proceeds of $1.3 billion after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $91.6 million and offering costs of $7.5 million.

Sources of Cash
At December 31, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity included cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaling $1.1 billion, with such amounts held for working capital purposes, and cash provided by operations. Our cash equivalents and short-term investments were comprised primarily of bank deposits, money market funds, U.S. treasury bills, U.S. treasury securities, U.S. agency securities, asset-backed securities, and corporate debt securities. We have generated significant operating losses as reflected in our accumulated deficit, which is a trend we expect to continue.
Uses of Cash
Our primary uses of cash include operating costs such as compensation and benefits, technology costs, professional services, lease obligations, and other expenditures necessary to support our business. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our planned continuing investment in product development, platform infrastructure, share repurchases, and global expansion. We will use our cash for a variety of needs, including for ongoing investments in our business, potential strategic acquisitions, capital expenditures, and investment in our infrastructure, including our non-cancellable purchase commitments with cloud-computing service providers and certain Issuing Banks.
We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and our short-term investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for more than the next 12 months, including the funding of our planned acquisition. For additional information about our planned acquisition, see Note 4 “Business Combinations” to our Consolidated Financial Statements. As of the date of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have access to and control over all our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, except amounts held as restricted cash. 
On February 3, 2023, we acquired all outstanding stock of Power Finance. Upon the closure of the acquisition, we paid $135.8 million to the shareholders of Power Finance Inc, net of cash acquired. As part of the terms of the acquisition, we paid additional cash of $53.1 million for contingent consideration tied to performance-based goals that were achieved. We also entered into postcombination cash compensation arrangements with certain key acquired employees whereby we agreed to pay them $85.1 million of cash over a weighted average 2.2 year service period following the acquisition date (subject to forfeiture upon termination). As of December 31, 2024, $14.2 million of the postcombination cash compensation arrangements remained outstanding.
Share Repurchase
On September 14, 2022, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program (the “2022 Share Repurchase Program”) of up to $100 million of our Class A common stock beginning September 15, 2022. Under the 2022 Share Repurchase Program, we were authorized to repurchase shares through open market purchases, in privately negotiated transactions or by other means, in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including through trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act. The 2022 Share Repurchase Program had no set expiration date; however, the 2022 Share Repurchase Program was exhausted during the first quarter of 2023. 
On May 8, 2023, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program (the “2023 Share Repurchase Program”) of up to $200 million of our Class A common stock. Under the 2023 Share Repurchase Program, we are authorized to repurchase shares through open market purchases, in privately negotiated transactions or by other means, in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including through trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act. The 2023 Share Repurchase Program has no set expiration date; however, the 2023 Share Repurchase Program was exhausted during the first quarter of 2024.
On May 6, 2024, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program (the “2024 Share Repurchase Program”) of up to $200 million of our Class A common stock. Under the 2024 Repurchase Program, we are authorized to repurchase shares through open market purchases, in privately negotiated transactions or by other means, in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including through trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act. The 2024 Share Repurchase Program has no set expiration date and may be canceled or suspended at any time without notice. As of December 31, 2024 $80.5 million remained available for future share repurchases under the 2024 Share Repurchase Program.

Table of Contents
On February 25, 2025, the Company’s board of directors authorized an additional share repurchase program of up to $300 million of the Company’s Class A common stock (the “2025 Share Repurchase Program”). Under the 2025 Share Repurchase Program, the Company is authorized to repurchase shares through open market purchases, in privately negotiated transactions, or by other means, in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including through trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act. The number of shares repurchased and the timing of purchases are based on general business and market conditions, and other factors, including legal requirements. The 2025 Share Repurchase Program has no set expiration date. 
Restricted Cash
At December 31, 2024, we had $8.5 million in restricted cash which included a deposit held at an Issuing Bank to provide the Issuing Bank collateral in the event that our customers' funds are not deposited at the Issuing Bank in time to settle our customers' transactions with the Card Networks. Restricted cash also includes cash held at a bank to secure our payments under a lease agreement for our office space.

Operating Activities
Our largest source of cash provided by our operating activities is our net revenue. Our primary uses of cash in our operating activities are for Card Network and Issuing Bank fees, and employee-related compensation. The timing of settlement of certain operating assets and liabilities, including revenue share payments, bonus payments, prepayments made to cloud-computing service providers, settlement receivables, and network incentive receivables can affect the amounts reported as Net cash used in or provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $58.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $21.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2024 was due mainly to higher gross profit and lower operating expenses that improved net income year-over-year and favorable timing  of settlement receivable collections. These benefits were partially offset by the unfavorable timing of revenue share payables.
Investing Activities
Net cash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of our investments in short-term investments and sale of equity method investments. Net cash used in investing activities consists primarily of purchases of short-term investments, purchases of property and equipment, and equity method investments. 
Net cash provided by investing activities was $70.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $38.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in net cash provided by investing activities is primarily due to the Power Finance acquisition which occurred in 2023, partially offset by a decrease in cash inflows from the maturities and sales of short-term investments and higher capitalization of internal-use-software in the current year.
Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities consists primarily of net payments related to the share-based compensation activities and share repurchase programs.
61
Table of Contents
Net cash used in financing activities was $186.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $261.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities is primarily due to the payment of the contingent consideration from our Power Finance acquisition in the prior year and lower payments to repurchase our Class A common stock under the 2024 and 2023 Share Repurchase Programs, partially offset by higher tax payments related to net share settlement of share-based compensation awards.
Obligations and Other Commitments 
Our principal commitments consist of obligations under our operating leases for office space and other non-cancellable purchase commitments. For additional information about our operating leases and non-cancellable purchase commitments, see 
Note 9
 “Leases” and 
Note 10
 “Commitments and Contingencies” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs, and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our accounting estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Our significant accounting policies, including recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements, are described in “
Note 2
 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the accompanying notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following policies involve accounting estimates and assumptions which we consider to be the most critical to our financial statements. An accounting estimate or assumption is considered critical if both (a) the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (b) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Revenue Recognition
We interact with third party Issuing Banks and Card Networks to deliver our Platform Services to our customers. For revenue generated from customer arrangements that involve third parties, there is significant judgment in evaluating whether we are the principal, and report revenue on a gross basis, or the agent, and report revenue on a net basis. In this assessment, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer. The assessment of whether we are considered the principal or the agent in a transaction could impact our Net revenue and Cost of revenue recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).
Business Combinations
When we acquire a business, the purchase price is allocated to the acquired assets, including separately identifiable intangible assets, and assumed liabilities at their respective estimated fair values. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with respect to intangible assets. These estimates can include, but are not limited to:
•
future expected cash flows from acquired developed technologies;
•
obsolescence curves and other useful life assumptions, such as the period of time and intended use of acquired intangible assets in our product offerings;
•
discount rates;
•
uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances; and
•
fair value of assumed equity awards.
62
Table of Contents
These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates, or actual results. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be recorded, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. We continue to collect information and reevaluate these estimates and assumptions quarterly and record any adjustments to our preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
We
 have operations within the United States and globally, and we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about these market risks is described below.
Interest Rate Risk
We
 had cash, cash equivalents, and 
short-term investments
 totaling $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2024. The fair value of our cash, cash equivalents, and 
short-term investments
 would not be significantly affected by either an i
ncrease or decrease in interest rates due to the short-term maturities of the majority of these instruments. Because we classify our short-term investments as “available-for-sale”, no gains or losses are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are due to credit losses. We have the ability to hold all short-term investments until their maturities. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decreas
e in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results or financial condition.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
Most
 of our sales and operating expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore our results of operations are not currently subject to significant foreign currency risk. As of December 31, 2024, a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our business would not have had a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Marqeta, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
Basis for Opinions
The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
66
Table of Contents
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Revenue share
For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company’s net revenue was $507.0 million. As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's contracts with customers typically include provisions under which the Company shares a portion of interchange fees as consideration payable to its customers, referred to as revenue share. Revenue share payments are incentives to customers to increase their processing volume on the Company’s platform and is computed as a percentage of the interchange fees earned or processing volume and is paid to customers monthly. Revenue share is recorded as a reduction to net revenue in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).
We identified the evaluation of revenue share amounts as a critical audit matter. The computation of revenue share amounts involved complexity, specifically the identification and evaluation of multiple data elements which can vary across different customer contracts and require manual processing given the underlying contract’s non-standard nature which impacted the extent of audit effort.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter.
•
We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the review of the Company’s revenue share calculation, including evaluating the completeness and accuracy of data elements used in the performance of this control. 
•
For a sample of monthly net revenue amounts recorded by customer, we independently evaluated the computation of revenue share applied in the calculation of net revenue by agreeing relevant data elements to contractual terms within executed contracts and other internal source documents detailing processing volume and fees resulting from interchange and issuing banks. We compared the result of our independently evaluated net revenue amounts to the amounts recorded by the Company.
67

•
For a further selection of December monthly net revenue amounts recorded by customer, we reviewed the Company’s computation of revenue share and resulting net revenue and agreed relevant data elements to contractual terms within executed contracts and other relevant internal source documents.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)

1.    
Business Overview and Basis of Presentation
Marqeta, Inc. (“the Company”) was incorporated in the state of Delaware in 2010 and creates digital payment technology for innovation leaders. The Company's modern card issuing platform empowers its customers to create customized and innovative payment card programs, giving them the configurability and flexibility to build better payment experiences.
The Company provides all of its customers issuer processor services and for most of its customers it also acts as a card program manager. The Company primarily earns revenue from processing card transactions for its customers.
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, which include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, have been prepared in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Reclassifications
Prior period amounts related to our Executive Chairman Long-Term Performance Award have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make various estimates and assumptions relating to reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent liabilities, and reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Significant estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, the fair value and useful lives of assets acquired and liabilities assumed through business combinations, the estimation of contingent liabilities, the fair value of equity awards and warrants, share-based compensation, the estimation of variable consideration in contracts with customers, the reserve for contract contingencies and processing errors, and valuation of income taxes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.
Business Risks and Uncertainties
The Company has incurred net losses except for the year ended December 31, 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company had net income of $
27.3
 million, which was primarily due to the forfeiture of the Executive Chairman Long-Term Incentive Award, and had an accumulated deficit of $
797.9
 million as of December 31, 2024. The Company expects losses from operations to continue for the foreseeable future as it incurs costs and expenses related to creating new products for customers, acquiring new customers, developing its brand, expanding into new geographies, and continued development of the existing platform infrastructure. The Company believes that its cash and cash equivalents of $
923.0
 million and short-term investments of $
179.4
 million as of December 31, 2024 are sufficient to fund its operations through at least the next twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements.
2.    
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Business Combinations
The Company allocates the purchase consideration for acquired companies to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date, with the excess recorded to goodwill. These estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). Acquisition-related expenses and postcombination integration and employee 
75
Table of Contents
Marqeta, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)
compensation costs are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of bank deposit accounts and investments in money market funds and certain U.S. treasury bills. The Company considers all highly liquid investments and investments with original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.

Restricted Cash
Restricted cash consists of deposits with Issuing Banks to provide the Issuing Bank collateral in the event that customers’ funds are not deposited at the Issuing Banks in time to settle customers’ transactions with the Card Networks. Restricted cash also includes cash used to secure a letter of credit for the Company’s office lease in Oakland, California. Issuing Banks are financial institutions that issue payment cards (credit, debit, or prepaid) either on their own behalf or on behalf of a business. Card Networks are networks that provide the infrastructure for settlement and card payment information flows.

Short-term Investments
The Company's short-term investments include U.S. treasury securities, U.S. agency securities, asset-backed securities, and corporate debt securities. The Company's short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded within current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as the Company may sell these securities at any time for use in its operations, even prior to maturity.
The Company carries these short-term investments at fair value and periodically evaluates them for unrealized losses. For securities in an unrealized loss position that the Company intends to hold and believes it is more likely than not that the securities will not be required to sell before recovery, the Company further evaluates whether declines in fair value below amortized cost are due to credit or non-credit related factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and any adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors.
The Company considers credit related impairments to be changes in value that are driven by a change in the creditor’s ability to meet its payment obligations, and records an allowance on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with a corresponding loss in Other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) when the impairment is incurred.
Unrealized non-credit related losses and unrealized gains are recorded as a separate component in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders’ equity until realized.
The Company records any realized gains or losses on the sale of short-term investments in Other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount, net of an allowance for credit losses and do not earn interest. The Company estimates an allowance for accounts receivable based on its assessment of the collectability of accounts by considering its historical accounts receivable collection experience for each customer, the age of each outstanding invoice, and an evaluation of current expected risk of credit loss based on current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions over the life of the receivable. The Company assesses collectability on an individual basis when it identifies specific customers with collectability issues, and on an aggregated basis by reviewing accounts receivable where similar characteristics exist.
 As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the combined general and specific allowance for accounts receivable was $
2.4
 million and $
1.7
 million, respectively.
Settlements Receivable
Settlements receivable represent Interchange Fees earned on customers’ card transactions, net of pass through Card Network fees, that are due from Issuing Banks. Interchange Fees are typically received 
76
Table of Contents
Marqeta, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)
within one or two business days of the transaction date. The Company has not experienced any historical collection issues with the Issuing Banks, and as such, no allowance has been established. The Company does not generate revenue from Issuing Banks.
Lease Obligations
The Company measures lease liabilities based on the present value of the total lease payments not yet paid discounted based on the Company’s incremental borrowing rate, which is the estimated rate the Company would be required to pay for a collateralized borrowing equal to the total lease payments over the term of the lease.
The Company measures right-of-use assets based on the corresponding lease liability adjusted for (i) payments made to the lessor at or before the commencement date, (ii) initial direct costs the Company incurs and (iii) tenant incentives under the lease. The Company begins to recognize rent expense when the lessor makes the underlying asset available to the Company.
For short-term leases, the Company records rent expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) on a straight-line basis over the lease term and records variable lease payments as incurred. The Company has no finance leases.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. The Company uses the straight-line method of depreciation and amortization over the estimated useful lives of the assets; generally 
three
 to 
five years
 for computer equipment, and furniture and fixtures. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term, excluding renewal periods, or the estimated useful life of the leasehold improvement. 
The Company capitalizes internal and external direct costs incurred related to obtaining or developing internal-use software. Costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized and are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the software, generally 
three years
 commencing on the first day of the month following when the software is ready for its intended use. Costs related to planning and other preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. 
The depreciation and amortization of property and equipment is recorded within Depreciation and amortization expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).

Goodwill
The excess purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill amounts are not amortized. 
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets with finite lives are carried at acquisition cost less accumulated amortization and are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis. The amortization of these assets is recorded within Depreciation and amortization expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Income) Loss.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)
Impairment
Impairment testing for goodwill is performed annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable. Such testing is performed at the reporting unit level. Management has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, including goodwill. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, a quantitative assessment is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The Company also has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative assessment.
The Company reviews the valuation of long-lived assets, including property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. An asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the future undiscounted cash flow the asset is expected to generate.
Based on management's assessment, the Company did not recognize any material impairment losses on its goodwill or finite-lived intangible assets during the periods presented herein. See 
Note 9
 for discussion of the Company’s operating lease impairment.

Equity Investments and Purchase Options
The Company applies the equity method of accounting for investments in other entities when the Company exercises significant influence, but no control. Under the equity method, the Company records its share of each entity’s profit or loss in Other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) on a one quarter lag when the most recent financial information of the investee becomes available. The Company periodically reviews investments accounted for under the equity method for impairment. Investments in other entities not accounted for under the equity method of accounting, including options to purchase these entities, are accounted for at cost less impairment, if applicable. Additionally, the value of these investments may be adjusted to fair value resulting from observable transactions for identical or similar investments.
In 2021, the Company acquired a preferred equity interest in a private company that is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Concurrent with this investment, the Company also acquired an option that gave the Company the right, but not the obligation, to purchase all of the remaining equity interests of the private company. 
As of December 31, 2021, the option was reflected within prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company applied the measurement alternative to measure the option at cost, less any impairment. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded an impairment of $
11.6
 million within Other income, net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) related to the option based on the Company’s decision not to exercise the option.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company sold its equity method investment in a private company. The carrying amount of this investment was $
7.8
 million as of the date of sale and the purchase price was $
25.7
 million. As a result, the Company recorded a gain of $
17.9
 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 in Other income, net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
Contracts with customers are evaluated on a contract-by-contract basis as contracts may include the transfer of multiple services. The Company’s contracts with customers typically include multiple 
78
Table of Contents
Marqeta, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)
performance obligations: 1) 
providing access to the Company's payment processing platform, 2) providing managed services, or 3) providing card fulfillment services
.
 The Company accounts for individual services as a separate performance obligation if they are distinct because the service is separately identifiable from other items in the arrangement and a customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. If these criteria are not met, the promised goods or services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. 
Certain customer contracts require the Company to allocate the transaction price of the contract based on the relative stand-alone selling price of the performance obligations which are based on prices at which the Company separately sells each service or estimated using an analysis of the Company’s historical contract pricing and costs incurred to fulfill its services.
The Company generates revenue from providing platform services and other services as described below.
Platform Services
The Company delivers an integrated payment processing platform to its customers. The Company’s primary performance obligation is to provide customers continuous access to the Company’s platform used to process all customers’ transactions as needed. This obligation includes authorizing, settling, clearing, and reconciling all transactions. Additionally, for certain customer arrangements, the performance obligations also include managing the interactions with Card Networks and/or the Issuing Banks on behalf of its customers or other managed services, including dispute management, fraud scoring, and cardholder support services. 
The Company’s platform services revenue is derived from Interchange Fees generated by customer card transactions. The Company accounts for these Interchange Fees as revenue earned from its customers for performance obligations where the Company controls the services before delivery to the customer. The Company’s platform services revenue also includes processing and other transaction fees from transactions that are based on either a percentage of processing volume or a fee per transaction basis. 

The Company’s platform services revenue primarily consists of stand-ready obligations which are satisfied over time and are accounted for as a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to customers.  
The Company recognizes revenue when the promised services are complete, and its performance obligations are satisfied. Platform services are considered complete when the Company has authorized the transaction, validated that the transaction has no errors, and accepted and posted the data to its records. 
The Company allocates variable consideration to the distinct period in which the platform services are delivered. When pricing terms are not consistent throughout the entire term of the contract, the Company estimates variable consideration in its customer contracts primarily using the expected value method. The standard term of the customer contracts ranges from 
three
 to 
five years
, with automatic renewal for successive 
one-year
 periods thereafter unless either party provides written notice of its intent not to renew. The Company develops estimates of variable consideration on the basis of both historical information and current trends and does not expect or anticipate significant reversal of revenue in the future periods.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)
For net revenue generated from customer arrangements that involve third parties, the Company determines whether it has promised to provide the specified service itself (as principal) or to arrange for the specified service to be provided by another party (as an agent).

This determination depends on the facts and circumstance of each arrangement, and in some instances, involves significant judgment. In order to deliver an integrated payment processing platform to its customers, the Company works with Issuing Banks and Card Networks in various capacities. The Company is considered the principal in customer arrangements where the Company controls the services performed by the Issuing Banks and Card Networks before delivery of the promised services to its customers, it is primarily responsible for the delivery of the services to customers, and it has discretion in vendor selection. As such, the Company records fees paid to the Issuing Banks and Card Networks as Costs of Revenue within the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). In instances where the Company is considered an agent in providing services to the customer, fees for services paid to Issuing Banks and Card Networks, if any, are recorded within Net Revenue such that Net Revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) reflects the net amount of consideration that the Company retains.
Revenue Share
The Company’s contracts with customers typically include provisions under which the Company shares a portion of the Interchange Fees as consideration payable to its customers, referred to as Revenue Share. Revenue Share payments are incentives to customers to increase their processing volume on the Company’s platform, and is computed as a percentage of the Interchange Fees earned or processing volume and is paid to customers monthly.
The Company records Revenue Share as a reduction to net revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). The Company records the amount due to the customer as Revenue Share payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
Other Services Revenue
The Company earns revenue from customers through card fulfillment services. Card fulfillment fees are generally billed to customers upon ordering card inventory and recognized as revenue when the ordered cards are shipped to the customers. The Company offers certain customers the option to purchase physical cards at a discount. The Company has concluded that the discount does not constitute a future material right because the discount is within a range typically offered to the class of customers. Therefore, the Company accounts for the discount as a reduction to revenue when the Company delivers the ordered cards to the customers.
Contract Assets and Deferred Revenue
Contract assets, reported within Prepaid expenses and other current assets or within Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, are primarily from upfront payments provided to certain customers and variable consideration from customer contracts where pricing terms are not consistent throughout the entire term of the contract. 

Deferred revenue, reported within Accrued expenses and other current liabilities or Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, arises when customers pay for services in advance of the Company's revenue recognition. The Company's deferred revenue is primarily due to undelivered card fulfillment services, variable consideration from customer contracts where pricing terms are not consistent throughout the entire term of the contract, and non-refundable upfront setup fees that are billed at contract inception.
Arrangements that include rights to additional goods or services that are exercisable at a customer’s discretion are generally considered options. The Company assesses if these options provide a material right to the customer and if so, they are considered performance obligations. This material right is valued by estimating the discount that will be redeemed by the customer during the optional renewal period.

Reserve for Contract Contingencies and Processing Errors
Customer contracts generally contain service level agreements that can result in performance penalties payable by the Company when contractually required service levels are not met or can result in payments by the Company for processing errors. As such, the Company records a reserve for estimated performance penalties and processing errors. When providing for these reserves, the Company considers factors such as its history of incurring performance penalties and processing errors, actual contractual penalty charge rates in customer contracts, and known or estimated processing errors. These reserves are included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the provision for contract contingencies and processing errors is included as a reduction to Net revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).
Costs of Revenue
Costs of revenue consist of Card Network costs, Issuing Bank costs, and card fulfillment costs for customer arrangements where the Company is the principal in providing services to the customer and excludes depreciation and amortization, which is reported separately within the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). Card Network costs are mostly equal to a specified percentage of the processing volume or a fixed amount per transaction processed through the respective Card Network. The Company incurs Card Network costs directly from contractual arrangements with the Card Networks that are passed entirely through Issuing Banks, or directly from the Card Networks. Issuing Bank costs compensate Issuing Banks for issuing cards to the Company’s customers and sponsoring the Company’s card programs with the Card Networks, and are typically equal to a specified percentage of the processing volume or a fixed amount per transaction, subject to monthly minimum amounts. Card fulfillment costs include physical cards, packaging, and other fulfillment costs.
The Company has marketing and incentive arrangements with Card Networks that provide the Company with monetary incentives for establishing customer card programs with, and routing volume through, the respective Card Network. The amount of the incentives is generally determined based on a percentage of the processing volume or the number of transactions routed over the Card Network. The Company records these incentives as a reduction of Card Network fees in customer arrangements where the Company is the principal. Generally, as processing volumes increase, the Company earns a higher rate of monetary incentives from these arrangements, subject to attaining certain volume thresholds during an annual measurement period. For certain incentive arrangements with an annual measurement period, the one-year period may not align with the Company’s fiscal year. 
Given the uncertainty in the ultimate annual attainment of network incentives, the Company records network incentives in the period contractual volume thresholds are attained. As such, unusual fluctuations in Card Network fees can occur in the quarter in which volume thresholds are attained as higher incentive rates are applied to volumes over the entire measurement periods, which can span six or twelve months. Generally, the Company earns a higher rate of monetary incentives during the first quarter of our fiscal year, as the annual measurement period is closest to completion and higher volume thresholds have been reached. In the second quarter of the fiscal year, we generally earn the lowest rate of monetary incentives, as the annual measurement period and volume thresholds have reset.
Uncollected incentives are included in Network incentives receivable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company's contracts with Card Networks and Issuing Banks typically have terms ranging from 
three
 to 
five years
 which may be renewed in 
one-year
 to 
two-year
 increments as agreed by both parties.
Advertising Costs
The Company expenses advertising costs as they are incurred.
 Advertising expenses for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, were $
2.3
 million, $
1.5
 million, and $
2.2
 million, respectively.
Research and Development Costs
Research and development costs, which consist primarily of salaries, employee benefits, share-based compensation, third-party hosting fees, and software licenses were $
141.4
 million, $
148.0

108.3
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Research and

development costs are expensed as incurred, and are included in Compensation and benefits and Technology expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).
Share-based Compensation
The primary types of share-based compensation utilized by the Company are restricted share units (“RSUs”), stock options, performance-based restricted stock units (“PSUs”), and the use of the employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”). The Company determines compensation expense associated with RSUs based on the estimated fair value of its common stock on the date of grant. The compensation expense associated with stock options is determined based on the estimated grant date fair value using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company generally recognizes compensation expense using a straight-line amortization method over the respective vesting period. The PSUs granted vest over 
three years
 and have a 
one year
 performance period with one-third of the PSUs subject to cliff vesting following the completion of the performance period, then vesting in equal quarterly installments thereafter. Over the performance period, the number of PSUs that may be issued and the related share-based compensation expense that is recognized is adjusted upward or downward based upon the probability of achieving the approved performance targets against the performance metrics. Depending on the probability of achieving the pre-established performance targets, the number of PSUs issued could range from 
0
% to 
200
% of the target amount. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.
Defined Contribution Plans
The Company maintains defined contribution plans for eligible employees, including a 401(k) plan that covers substantially all of its U.S. based employees and to which the Company provides a matching contribution of 
50
% of the first 
6
% of compensation that an employee contributes. The matching contribution vests immediately.

Restructuring
Restructuring costs stem from employee related severance charges and include both cash and non-cash compensation. The Company generally recognizes restructuring costs upon communication of the plan to the identified employees or when payments are probable and amounts are estimable, depending on the region an employee works. Restructuring liabilities are classified in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
The Company recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that it believes these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, the Company considers the available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized. If the Company determines that it is able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, the Company decreases the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which reduces the income tax expense.
Uncertain tax positions are recognized only when the Company believes it is more likely than not that the tax position will be upheld on examination by the taxing authorities based on the merits of the position. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions in Income tax expense (benefit) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).

Net Income (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders
The Company presents basic and diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders in conformity with the two-class method. The Company calculates basic net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders gives effect to all potential shares of common stock, including common stock issuable upon conversion of redeemable convertible preferred stock and redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants, stock options, RSUs, PSUs and common stock warrants to the extent these are dilutive.
Loss Contingencies 
The Company may be involved in various lawsuits, claims, and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability for these when it believes it is probable that it has incurred a loss, and the Company can reasonably estimate the loss. The Company regularly evaluates current information to determine whether it should adjust a recorded liability or record a new one. 
If a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company discloses the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 Judgment is required to determine both the probability and the estimated amount.

Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is an exit price, representing the price that would be received to sell the financial asset or paid to transfer the financial liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
The fair value hierarchy includes a three-level classification, which is based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used for measurement are observable:
•
Level 1 ‑
 Inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets as of the reporting date;
•
Level 2 ‑
 Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly; or
•
Level 3 ‑
 Unobservable pricing inputs in the market.
When developing fair value measurements, the Company maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs. In instances where the Company lacks observable inputs in the market to measure the fair value of an asset or liability, the Company may use unobservable inputs which requires greater judgment in measuring fair value. In instances where there is limited or no observable market data, fair value measurements for assets and liabilities are based primarily upon the Company’s own estimates, and the measurements reflect information and assumptions that management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability.
The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, settlements receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities. Cash equivalents are stated at amortized cost, which approximates fair value at the balance sheet dates, due to the short period of time to maturity. Short-term investments are carried at fair value. Accounts receivable, settlements receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities are stated at their carrying value, which approximates fair value due to the short period of time to the expected receipt or payment date.

Foreign Currency
The functional currency of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is its respective local currency. For these foreign entities, the Company translates the financial statements into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates for the period for income statement amounts and using end-of-period exchange rates for assets and liabilities. There translation adjustments are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in Other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.” The amended guidance requires incremental reportable segment disclosures, primarily about significant segment expenses. The amendments also require entities with a single reportable segment to provide all disclosures required by these amendments, and all existing segment disclosures. The amendments do not change how an entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates those operating segments, or applies quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments. The amendment was applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements and was effective for the Company in fiscal 2024, and will be effective for interim periods in fiscal 2025. The Company adopted the new disclosure requirements in 
Note 17
 “Segments.” While the standard requires additional disclosures related to the Company’s single reportable segment, the standard did not have any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-09”), which modifies the rules on income tax disclosures to require entities to disclose (1) specific categories in the rate reconciliation, (2) the income or loss from continuing operations before income tax expense or benefit (separated between domestic and foreign) and (3) income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations (separated by federal, state and foreign). ASU 2023-09 also requires entities to disclose their income tax payments to international, federal, state and local jurisdictions, among other changes. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. ASU 2023-09 should be applied on a prospective basis, but retrospective application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this new guidance on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In November 2024, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2024-03, “Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures” (“ASU 2024-03”). ASU 2024-03 is intended to improve disclosures about a public business entity's expenses and provide more detailed information to investors about the types of expenses in commonly presented expense captions. The amendments in this ASU are effective for the Company in fiscal 2027 on a retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this guidance on its disclosures.

TransactPay
On December 23, 2024, we entered into an agreement with Neptune International Ltd, an exempted company limited by shares incorporated under the laws of Bermuda, to purchase its TransactPay business for approximately €
45.0
 million in cash, and an additional amount up to €
5.0
 million for contingent consideration tied to performance-based goals. TransactPay provides BIN Sponsorship, E-Money Licensing, and Virtual Account services in the UK and Europe. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2025 and is subject to the regulatory transfer of the E-Money Institution license and other customary closing conditions.
Power Finance Inc. 
On February 3, 2023, the Company acquired all outstanding stock of Power Finance Inc. (“Power Finance”) for a base cash purchase price of $
221.9
 million. The purchase price does not include $
53.1
 million of contingent consideration tied to performance-based goals which were expected to be achieved within 12 months from the date of acquisition. The Company determined the acquisition-date fair value of the contingent consideration liability, based on the likelihood of payment related to the contingent earn-out clauses, as part of the consideration transferred. 
Power Finance’s cloud-based platform offers credit card program management services for companies creating new credit card programs. The acquisition of Power Finance will accelerate the Company’s credit product capabilities and allow the Company’s customers to launch a wide range of credit products and constructs.

2.2
 years. Postcombination expense recognized was $
39.7
 million and $
36.4
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 and is included within Compensation and benefits in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).
The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. The final $
163.6
 million purchase consideration was attributed to $
41.0
 million of developed technology intangible assets (to be amortized over an estimated useful life of 
7.0
 years), $
8.0
 million of deferred tax liabilities, and $
7.1
 million of net assets acquired, with the $
123.5
 million excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed recorded as goodwill. The fair value of the developed technology intangible assets was estimated using the multi-period excess earnings method (“MPEEM”), a form of the income approach. The principle behind this method is that the value of the intangible asset is equal to the present value of the after-tax cash flows attributable to the intangible asset. The Company applied judgment which involved the use of certain assumptions with respect of the revenue and EBITDA forecasts, obsolescence rate, and discount rate. The goodwill recognized was primarily attributable to the expected synergies from integrating Power Finance’s technology into the Company’s platform. Goodwill was not considered deductible for tax purposes.  
The financial results of Power Finance are included in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of acquisition. Separate operating results and pro forma results of operations for Power Finance have not been presented as the effect of this acquisition was not material to the Company’s financial results. Acquisition-related third-party transaction costs were $
3.3
 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and are included in Professional services in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). Transaction costs for the Power Finance acquisition were immaterial for the year ended December 31, 2024.
During the third quarter of 2023, the Company paid out $
53.1
 million as the performance-based goals tied to the contingent consideration were achieved during the second quarter of 2023.

The Company did not have any short-term investments in unrealized loss positions as of December 31, 2024. The Company had 
four
 separate short-term investments in unrealized loss positions as of December 31, 2023. Generally, the Company does not intend to sell any short-term investments that have unrealized losses, and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell such securities before any anticipated recovery of the entire amortized cost basis.
There were 
no
 material realized gains or losses from short-term investments that were reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. For short-term investments that have unrealized losses, the Company evaluated whether (i) the Company has the intention to sell any of these investments, (ii) it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell any of these available-for-sale debt securities before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis and (iii) the decline in the fair value of the investment is due to credit or non-credit related factors. Based on this evaluation, the Company determined that for its short-term investments, there were no material credit or non-credit related impairments as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

The Company classifies money market funds, U.S. treasury bills, U.S. treasury securities, U.S. agency securities, asset-backed securities, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and corporate debt securities within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because the Company values these investments using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs.
There were no transfers of financial instruments between the fair value hierarchy levels during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Leases
In 2016, the Company entered into a lease agreement for its principal executive office located in Oakland, California (the “Oakland lease”), for 
19,000
 square feet of office space, which was subsequently amended resulting in a total of 
63,000
 square feet of office space being leased.  The non-cancellable operating lease expires in February 2026 and includes options to extend the lease term, generally at the then-market rates. The Company excludes extension options that are not reasonably certain to be exercised from its lease terms. The Company’s lease payments consist primarily of fixed rental payments for the right to use the underlying leased assets over the lease terms. The Company is responsible for operating expenses that exceed the amount of base operating expenses as defined in the original lease agreement.
During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company made a decision and ceased use of 
two
 floors which was identified as a triggering event to reassess the asset group and test for impairment. This assessment resulted in an impairment of the Oakland lease and recognition of a loss of $
1.4
 million included within Occupancy expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). The estimated fair value of the right-of-use asset was measured on a nonrecurring basis determined using Level 3 inputs and is based on an income approach using probability weighted discounted future cash flows. See Note 2 “Significant Accounting Policies” on Impairment of Long-Lived Assets for details.

Commitments and Contingencies
Letters of Credit
In connection with the Oakland lease, the Company is required to provide the landlord a letter of credit in the amount of $
1.5
 million. The Company has secured this letter of credit by depositing $
1.5
 million with the issuing financial institution, and this deposit is classified as Restricted cash in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
Purchase Obligations
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had non-cancellable purchase commitments with certain service providers and Issuing Banks of $
151.4
 million, payable over the next 
3
 years. These purchase obligations include $
138.7
 million related to minimum commitments as part of a cloud-computing service agreement. The remaining obligations are related to various service providers and Issuing Banks processing fees over the fixed, non-cancellable respective contract terms.
Defined Contribution Plans
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company contributed a total of $
5.0
 million, $
5.5
 million, and $
5.8
 million to its defined contribution plans, respectively.

Legal Contingencies
From time to time in the normal course of business, the Company may be subject to various legal matters such as threatened or pending claims or proceedings. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no legal contingency matters, either individually or in aggregate, that the Company deemed probable that would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Given the unpredictable nature of legal proceedings, the Company bases its assessment on the information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the probability of the loss contingency and the potential liability, and may revise the estimate.
On December 9, 2024, a putative securities class action lawsuit, captioned 
Wai v. Marqeta, Inc., et al.
, Case No. 24-cv-08874 (N.D. Cal.), was filed in federal court in the Northern District of California (“Court”) against the Company, its Chief Executive Officer, and its Chief Financial Officer (“Defendants”) alleging violations of federal securities laws. The lawsuit asserts that during the putative class period of between August 7, 2024 and November 4, 2024, Defendants made false or misleading statements relating to the Company’s performance or revenue and gross profit expectations in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. 
On December 10, 2024, a second putative securities class action lawsuit, captioned 
Ford v. Marqeta, Inc., et al.
, Case No. 24-cv-08892 (N.D. Cal.), was filed in the same Court against the same Defendants alleging violations of the same federal securities laws. The second lawsuit asserts similar theories of liability as the first lawsuit but alleges a broader putative class period of between May 7, 2024 and November 4, 2024 and some additional and/or different allegations on which the claims are based. Both lawsuits (collectively, the “Securities Actions”) seek to recover damages on behalf of shareholders who acquired shares of the Company’s common stock during their respective putative class periods. Several individuals filed motions to consolidate the Securities Actions and for appointment as lead plaintiff, which are scheduled for a hearing on March 18, 2025. We expect that the Securities Actions will be consolidated and proceed as 
one
 lawsuit after the Court appoints a lead plaintiff for the putative class. Given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or on the amount or range of any potential loss. The Company and the other Defendants intend to file a motion to dismiss the Securities Actions after the Court-appointed lead plaintiff files a consolidated amended complaint or otherwise designates the operative complaint for the Securities Actions.
Settlement of Payment Transactions
Generally, customers deposit a certain amount of pre-funding into accounts maintained at Issuing Banks to settle their payment transactions. Such pre-funding amounts may only be used to settle customers’ payment transactions and are not considered assets of the Company. As such, the funds held in customers’ accounts at Issuing Banks are not reflected on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. If a customer does not have sufficient funds to settle a transaction, the Company is liable to the Issuing Bank to settle the transaction and would therefore incur losses if such amounts cannot be subsequently recovered from the customer. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $
7.0
 million in Restricted cash which included a deposit held at an Issuing Bank to provide the Issuing Bank collateral in the event that our customers' funds are not deposited at the Issuing Bank in time to settle our customers' transactions with the Card Networks.
Indemnifications
In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into agreements of varying scope and terms pursuant to which it agrees to indemnify customers, Card Networks, Issuing Banks, vendors, lessors, and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the breach of such agreements, services to be provided by the Company or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. With respect to Issuing Banks, the Company has received requests for indemnification from time to time and may indemnify the Issuing Bank for losses the Issuing Bank may incur for non-compliance with applicable law and regulation, if those losses resulted from the Company’s failure to perform under its program agreement with the Issuing Bank.
In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and certain officers and employees that will require the Company, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors, officers, or employees. No 
93

(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)
demands have been made upon the Company to provide indemnification under such agreements and there are no claims that the Company is aware of that could have a material effect on its Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Income) Loss, or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
The Company also includes service level commitments to its customers warranting certain levels of performance and permitting those customers to receive credits in the event the Company fails to meet those levels.
11.    
Stock Incentive Plans
The Company has granted share-based awards to employees, non-employee directors, and other service providers of the Company under the Amended and Restated 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (“2011 Plan”) and the 2021 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (“2021 Plan” and, together with the 2011 Plan, the “Plans”). The 2011 Plan was terminated in June 2021 in connection with the IPO but continues to govern the terms of outstanding awards that were granted prior to the IPO. Additionally, the Company offers an ESPP, which allows employees to purchase shares of common stock at 
85
% of the fair value of the Company’s Class A common stock on the first or last day of the offering period, whichever is lower. The offering periods are six months long and start in May and November of each year. 
The following table presents the share-based compensation expense recognized within the following line items in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) and Consolidated Balance Sheet in the periods presented:

. On June 8, 2021, the Company completed its IPO and the liquidity condition for these awards was satisfied and the Company recognized a cumulative share-based compensation expense of $
23.1
 million associated with RSUs that had service-vested as of the IPO completion date. Subsequent to the IPO, the unamortized grant date fair value of these RSUs will be recorded as share-based compensation expense over the remaining service period.
RSUs granted on or after April 1, 2021, vest upon the satisfaction of a service condition. In general, the service condition for these awards is satisfied over

.
The fair value of RSUs is based on the closing price of the Company’s Class A common stock on the grant date. Prior to the IPO, the fair value of RSUs was based on the fair value of the underlying common stock on the grant date as determined by the Company’s board of directors at each meeting in which RSU awards were approved.

During the first quarter of 2024, the Company granted performance-based restricted stock units (“PSUs”), under the 2021 Plan, to certain employees of the Company based on an initial target number. The final number of PSUs that may vest and settle depend upon the Company’s performance against pre-established performance metrics over a predefined performance period, contingent on the compensation committee’s approval of the level of achievement against the pre-established performance targets at the end of the fiscal year. The PSUs granted vest over 
three years
 and have a 
one year
 performance period with one-third of the PSUs subject to cliff vesting following the completion of the performance period then vesting in equal quarterly installments thereafter. Over the performance period, the number of PSUs that may be issued and the related share-based compensation expense that is recognized is adjusted upward or downward based upon the probability of achieving the approved performance targets against the performance metrics. Depending on the probability of achieving the pre-established performance targets, the number of PSUs issued could range from 
0
% to 
200
% of the target amount.
A summary of the Company's RSUs and PSUs activity under the Plans was as follows:

Executive Chairman Long-Term Performance Award
In April and May 2021, the Company’s board of directors granted the Company’s Executive Chairman and then-Chief Executive Officer equity incentive awards in the form of performance-based stock options covering 
19,740,923
 and 
47,267
 shares of the Company’s Class B common stock with an exercise price of $
21.49
 and $
23.40
 per share, respectively, (collectively, the “Executive Chairman Long-Term Performance Award,” formerly known as the CEO Long-Term Performance Award). The Executive Chairman Long-Term Performance Award vests upon the satisfaction of a service condition and the achievement of certain stock price hurdles over a 
seven year
 performance period following the expiration of the lock-up period associated with the Company’s IPO in 2021. 
During the second quarter of 2024, the Company’s Executive Chairman stepped down from his role and transitioned to a non-employee director role on the board of directors causing the Executive Chairman Long-Term Performance Award to be forfeited per its terms resulting in a one-time reversal of share-based compensation expenses of $
167.3
 million, of which $
144.6
 million related to expenses recognized in prior years. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.
12.    
Stockholders’ Equity Transactions
Warrants to Purchase Common Stock
In 2021 and 2020, the Company issued warrants to customers to purchase up to 
1.2
 million and 
0.8
 million shares of the Company’s common stock, respectively. These warrants vest based on certain performance conditions that include issuing a specific percentage of new cards on the Company’s platform over a defined measurement period and reaching certain annual transaction count thresholds over the contract term, respectively. All warrants have an exercise price of $
0.01
 per share. These warrants are classified as equity instruments and are treated as consideration payable to a customer. The grant date fair values of these warrants are recorded as a reduction to net revenue over the term of the respective customer contract based on the expected pattern of processing volume generated by the customer and the probability of vesting conditions being met. 
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
1.2
 million and 
1.1
 million warrants were vested, respectively. The Company recorded $
1.7
 million and $
5.5
 million as a reduction of net revenue related to these warrants during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Upon vesting, the fair value of the vested warrants are recorded into the Company’s additional paid-in capital. Timing differences caused by the pattern of processing volume generated by the customer over the original terms of the contract and the vesting schedules of the warrants can cause differences in the amount of grant date fair value that is credited to additional paid in capital upon vesting and the amount recorded as a reduction in net revenue during any particular reporting period.  
Share Repurchase Programs
On September 14, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $

Net Income (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders
Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding adjusted for the dilutive effect of all potential shares of common stock. In periods when the Company reported a net loss, diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share because the effects of potentially dilutive items were anti-dilutive.
The Company calculated basic and diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders as follows:

(1) The prior period Net income (loss) per share for Class A and Class B common stock has been presented separately to conform with current period presentation, which had no impact on our previously reported basic or diluted Net income (loss) per share.
As liquidation and dividend rights are identical for Class A common stock and Class B common stock, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis and the resulting income (loss) per share will, therefore, be the same for both Class A common stock and Class B common stock on an individual or combined basis.

In accordance with ASC 740 and based on all available evidence on a jurisdictional basis, the Company believes that it is more likely than not that its U.S. deferred tax assets will not be utilized and has recorded a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets in the U.S. jurisdiction. The Company assesses on a periodic basis the likelihood that it will be able to recover its deferred tax assets. The Company considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income or losses and expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. If it is not more likely than not that the Company expects to recover its deferred tax assets, the Company will increase its provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that it estimates will not ultimately be recoverable. The available negative evidence at December 31, 2024 and 2023 included historical and projected future operating losses. As a result, the Company concluded that an additional valuation allowance of $
7.5
 million and $
29.3
 million was required to reflect the change in its deferred tax assets prior to valuation allowance during 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company considered it more likely than not that substantially all of its deferred tax assets would not be realized.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $
175.6
 million and $
153.1
 million for federal and state tax purposes, respectively. Of the Company's federal net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2024, $
157.5
 million can be carried forward indefinitely but is limited to 80% of taxable income. If not utilized, the federal and state net operating carryforwards will begin to expire in 2035 and 2025, respectively. 
In addition, the Company had research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $
34.6
 million for federal income tax purposes and $
14.2
 million for California tax purposes. If not utilized, the federal research and development tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2031. The California state research credit can be carried forward indefinitely. 
Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the Company's ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes in any taxable year may be limited if the Company has experienced an ownership change. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has concluded that it has experienced ownership changes since inception and that its utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes will be subject to annual limitations.
The Company files federal, state, and foreign income tax returns in jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitations. To the extent the Company has tax attributes carryforwards, the tax years in which the attribute was generated may still be adjusted upon examination by the federal, state, or foreign tax authorities to the extent utilized in a future period.
The Company made an accounting policy election to provide for the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) tax expense in the year the tax is incurred as a period cost. The Company elected and applied the tax law ordering approach when considering GILTI as part of its valuation allowance.
The Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if the Company believes that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The Company makes adjustments to the reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. 
A reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits was as follows:

The Company’s policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within our tax provision for income taxes. The Company did 
no
t accrue any interest or penalties during the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company had $
12.2
 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2024, which would not affect its effective tax rate if recognized due to the Company’s valuation allowance. The Company expects no significant increases or decreases to its unrecognized benefits within the next twelve months.

Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
Based on such evaluation, our management has concluded our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2024.
Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Under the supervision of and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in “Internal Control - Integrated Framework” (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on that assessment, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by KPMG, LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act) during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, except as described below.
Material Weakness Remediation
As previously disclosed with the audit of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, we identified the following material weaknesses:
1.
In the period ended March 31, 2023, management identified a material weakness related to the accounting for our acquisition of Power Finance, including a lack of sufficient precision in the performance of reviews supporting the purchase price allocation accounting, and a lack of timely oversight over third-party specialists and the reports they produced to support the accounting for the Power Finance acquisition. 
2.
For the period ended December 31, 2023, management identified a material weakness related to information technology general controls in user access over certain information technology systems that support the Company’s revenue and related financial reporting processes.
106
Table of Contents
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company implemented measures designed to remediate the control deficiencies contributing to the material weaknesses. These remediation actions included refining the design of our review controls surrounding purchase price allocation accounting—providing more robust oversight of third-party specialists’ work and improving the precision of management review activities—as well as conducting additional training and awareness programs addressing user access requirements and policies, increasing oversight and verification of user access controls, and implementing new tools to administer user access more effectively. These efforts resulted in the remediation of the previously identified material weaknesses as of December 31, 2024.
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
The effectiveness of any internal control over financial reporting is subject to inherent limitations, including the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing, operating, and evaluating the controls and procedures, and the inability to eliminate misconduct completely. Accordingly, any system of internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable, not absolute assurance that its objectives will be met. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. We intend to continue to monitor and upgrade our internal controls as necessary or appropriate for our business, but cannot assure you that such improvements will be sufficient to provide us with effective internal control over financial reporting.
