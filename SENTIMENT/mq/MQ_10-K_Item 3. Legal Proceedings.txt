Item 3. Legal Proceedings
From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. We are currently involved in the following matter:
On December 9, 2024, a putative securities class action lawsuit, captioned 
Wai v. Marqeta, Inc., et al.
, Case No. 24-cv-08874 (N.D. Cal.), was filed in federal court in the Northern District of California (“Court”) against the Company, its Chief Executive Officer, and its Chief Financial Officer (“Defendants”) alleging violations of federal securities laws. The lawsuit asserts that during the putative class period of between August 7, 2024 and November 4, 2024, Defendants made false or misleading statements relating to the Company’s performance or revenue and gross profit expectations in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. 
On December 10, 2024, a second putative securities class action lawsuit, captioned 
Ford v. Marqeta, Inc., et al.
, Case No. 24-cv-08892 (N.D. Cal.), was filed in the same Court against the same Defendants alleging violations of the same federal securities laws. The second lawsuit asserts similar theories of liability as the first lawsuit but alleges a broader putative class period of between May 7, 2024 and November 4, 2024 and some additional and/or different allegations on which the claims are based. Both lawsuits (collectively, the “Securities Actions”) seek to recover damages on behalf of shareholders who acquired shares of the Company’s common stock during their respective putative class periods. Several individuals filed motions to consolidate the Securities Actions and for appointment as lead plaintiff, which are scheduled for a hearing on March 18, 2025. We expect that the Securities Actions will be consolidated and proceed as one lawsuit after the Court appoints a lead plaintiff for the putative class. 
On February 4, 2025, a putative shareholder derivative lawsuit, captioned 
Smith v. Khalaf, et al.
, Case No. 25-cv-01174 (N.D. Cal.), was filed in the same Court against the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, its Chief Financial Officer, and its Board of Directors, and names the Company as a nominal defendant. This lawsuit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duties and violations of federal securities laws, among other claims, between the time period of May 7, 2024 and November 4, 2024 under similar theories as the Securities Actions. Another substantially similar putative shareholder derivative lawsuit, captioned 
Ojserkis v. Khalaf, et al.
, Case No. 25-cv-01883 (N.D. Cal.), was filed on February 21, 2025. 
Given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the amount or range of any potential loss. The Company and the other Defendants intend to file a motion to dismiss the Securities Actions after the Court-appointed lead plaintiff files a consolidated amended complaint or otherwise designates the operative complaint for the Securities Actions.

Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
Market Information for Common Stock
Our Class A common stock has traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “MQ” since our IPO on June 9, 2021. Prior to that date, there was no public market for our common stock. There is no public trading market for our Class B common stock.
Stockholders
As of February 21, 2025, we had 37 holders of record of our Class A common stock and 48 holders of record of our Class B common stock. Because many of the shares of our Class A common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of beneficial owners of our Class A common stock represented by the record holders.
Dividend Policy
We have not declared or paid any cash dividend on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to declare cash dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors, subject to applicable laws, and will depend on a number of factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, any contractual restrictions, general business conditions, and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant.
Stock Performance Graph
The following performance graph shall not be deemed “soliciting material” or deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any of our filings under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act.
The following stock performance graph depicts the cumulative total return on our Class A common stock relative to the cumulative total returns of the Nasdaq Composite Index and the S&P Information Technology Index during each monthly period from June 9, 2021 (the date our Class A common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market) through December 31, 2024. All values assume a $100 initial investment and reinvestment of dividends. The returns shown are based on historical results and are not intended to be indicative of future performance.

On May 6, 2024, the Company’s board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $200 million of the Company’s Class A common stock (the “2024 Share Repurchase Program”). Under the 2024 Share Repurchase Program, the Company is authorized to repurchase shares through open market purchases, in privately negotiated transactions or by other means, in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including through trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act. The number of shares repurchased and the timing of purchases are based on general business and market conditions, and other factors, including legal requirements. The 2024 Share Repurchase Program has no set expiration date.
Use of Proceeds
The IPO of our Class A common stock was effected pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-256154), which was declared effective by the SEC on June 8, 2021.
There has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds from our IPO as discussed in our final prospectus filed with the SEC on June 10, 2021, pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Securities Act.
