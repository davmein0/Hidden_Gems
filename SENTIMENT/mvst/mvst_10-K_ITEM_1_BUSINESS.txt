ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Microvast Holdings, Inc. is an advanced battery technology company, headquartered in Stafford, Texas, and publicly traded on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol MVST. We specialize in the design, development, and manufacturing of battery components and systems primarily for electric commercial vehicles and utility-scale energy storage systems ("ESS").
Founded in 2006, Microvast was built on a guiding principle that remains central to our mission today: to innovate lithium-ion battery designs without relying on past technologies. We call this true innovation. We started without preconceived notions of lithium-ion battery creation, unlike many companies that repurposed legacy technologies for new markets like electric vehicles – a process we consider product development rather than true innovation.  To understand this difference is to understand what we have set out to achieve.
Our mission is to accelerate the global transition to electrification by delivering innovative battery solutions that support the adoption of electric vehicles and renewable energy. A key strategic focus is to be in a position to lead U.S. domestic battery production, reducing reliance on overseas suppliers, and strengthening national energy independence.  We believe continuous investment in our technology and operations will deliver long-term targeted revenue and income growth.
Through a vertically integrated approach, we have developed proprietary technologies spanning the entire battery system—from the core cell materials - including cathodes, anodes, electrolytes, and separators - to cells, modules, packs, energy storage containers, thermal management systems, battery management systems, high voltage control boxes, and more.  Our expertise has driven advancements in ultra-fast charging, high energy density, long lifespan, and safety—critical factors for commercial transportation and ESS applications.
We are expanding our production of battery systems and components, with an increased emphasis on ESS solutions to support the broader shift to electrification. Our goal is to become a global leader in ESS, bridging the gap between EVs and renewable energy. 
One of our recent innovations is our high-energy nickel manganese cobalt ("NMC") 53.5 ampere-hour battery cell (the “53.5Ah”). We believe its advanced performance characteristics make it an optimal solution for both commercial vehicle and ESS applications. To bring this product to market, we have made substantial investments in capacity expansion in Huzhou, China, where we operate fully automated production equipment that delivers significant operational efficiencies. 
In previous years, we made significant investments in our capacity expansion in Clarksville, Tennessee and by the fourth quarter of 2023 had started to install certain sections of the production line. However, progress on certain third party construction workstreams as well as taking delivery and possession of further equipment started to be impacted toward the end of the fourth quarter of 2023 due to the required funding to complete the project not being secured. Ultimately, in the second quarter of 2024, we paused construction efforts on the Clarksville development due to insufficient funding. We made a strategic decision to pivot from the originally planned production of NMC production in Clarksville, Tennessee to the 565Ah lithium iron phosphate ("LFP") battery. We also consolidated our ESS operations previously in Colorado to Clarksville, Tennessee in order to enhance operational efficiencies and speed of deliveries for our U.S. business.
In August 2024, we introduced the Mega Energizer 6 MWh ("ME6") ESS container, featuring the LFP battery. The shift toward LFP technology for the U.S. ESS market is a strategic decision. The ME6 system offers a cycle life exceeding 10,000 cycles, a lifespan of up to 30 years, compact storage capabilities (6 megawatt hours ("MWh"), and enhanced reliability through IP55, C4, and nitrogen protection features. The adoption of LFP batteries provides lower costs, greater safety, and environmental benefits compared to NMC technology, further supporting our sustainability goals. Although construction progress has been negatively impacted by funding constraints, our goal is that our Clarksville, Tennessee facility will be our major production facility for LFP cells once financing is secured and the facility is completed. 
In January 2025, we announced what we believe is a major breakthrough in solid-state battery technology. This innovation represents a paradigm shift, delivering higher energy density for extended range and improved efficiency, enhanced safety by eliminating risks associated with thermal runaway, and faster charging capabilities with an extended cycle life. We plan to make substantial investments in research and development ("R&D") to accelerate commercialization, with applications spanning EVs, grid storage, and high-performance energy systems.

Our promotion of battery components begins with engaging R&D engineers from passenger car OEMs and consumer electronics manufacturers. We may provide select customers with material samples or prototypes for evaluation to facilitate component sales.
Materials
Every lithium-ion battery consists of an anode, cathode, electrolyte and separator. 
•
Anode 
— Our anode is selected historically from LTO or graphite in our product cells. In the coming years, we anticipate that we will develop and market a new product that contains silicon or silicon oxide.  
•
Cathode 
— For NMC, our existing products are made using commercially supplied materials, and our future cell products will utilize FCG when possible. For NMC-based cathodes, the sourcing and availability of cobalt is a key issue for many OEM buyers. As such, we are actively engaged in research to greatly reduce or eliminate the use of cobalt from our material stream. We have made LFP cells for a manufacturer of passenger EVs in China and the raw materials for this cell are sourced from a commercial supplier.
•
Electrolyte 
— Our current lithium-ion cells utilize liquid-based electrolyte formulations. We often purchase base solvents for carbonate-based electrolytes from commercial suppliers to leverage cost benefits of scale, blending them in-house to protect our proprietary formulations.
•
Separator 
— The separator is another key material in our lithium-ion cells. While we have in the past used the industry norm polyethylene/polypropylene materials, we are now working so that in the future we will integrate as many cells as possible with our proprietary polyaramid technology. Additionally, we are leveraging our polyaramid expertise to develop a solid electrolyte battery system incorporating polyaramid material. If the solid electrolyte approach is successful, not only will it eliminate the use of liquid electrolytes, but it will also potentially enable new anode chemistries such as lithium metal, which is needed to reach cells with over 1,000 Wh/l energy densities.
Suppliers and Supply Arrangements
We source key electrode raw materials and various components exclusively from a select few third-party suppliers.

Customers 
We have established various arrangements with leading global EV manufacturers to develop batteries and systems, primarily for the commercial vehicle market. Our battery systems are used in the plug-in hybrid EV, battery EV and hybrid EV markets. In the electric commercial vehicle market, we typically engage in long-term supply or framework agreements without imposing minimum purchase obligations on the customer. Customers under these agreements issue purchase orders for specific quantities of battery systems, which serve as their contractual commitments.

The sales cycle of our solutions and a relatively small customer base result in significant customer concentration. In 2024, our top five customers accounted for 60.0% of our revenue. See “
Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business and Industry — Our revenue heavily depends on a limited customer base, a trend likely to continue."
As of December 31, 2024, our battery systems had an order backlog worth approximately $401.3 million. We expect to fulfill most of our backlog within 2025 and 2026.

Risks Related to Our Business and Industry.” Our ability to differentiate through superior technology, operational efficiency and market adaptability will be critical to sustaining long-term growth and competitiveness in this rapidly evolving landscape.
Governmental Regulation and Environmental Compliance
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters  — Our China Facility
Our manufacturing activities in China are subject to the requirements of Chinese environmental laws and regulations on air emission, wastewater discharge, solid waste, noise and the generation, handling, storage, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials. Our Environmental Management system is certified to 

ISO 14001:2015 and our Occupational Health and Safety system is certified to ISO 45001:2018. Our management systems support our commitment to ensure we are in

compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in all material aspects.  We have built environmental treatment facilities concurrently with the construction of our manufacturing facilities, where the waste air, wastewater and waste solids we generate can be treated in accordance with the relevant requirements. We have outsourced the disposal of hazardous solid waste we generate to a third-party contractor in accordance with the relevant laws. We believe we have maintained pollutant emission levels at each of our facilities in material compliance with levels prescribed by the relevant governmental authorities.
Environmental , Health and Safety Matters — Our Germany Production Facility
Operations at our German facility are subject to a variety of environmental, health and safety regulations. Quality Management system is certified to IATF 16949:2016 and ISO 9001:2015. We are working on the environmental certification to ISO 14001:2015 expected later into 2025. All our machines and production lines are delivered with Conformitè Europëenne, European Quality Standard label according to the Machinery Directive 2006/42/EG.
In transit, lithium-ion batteries are subject to rules governing the transportation of “dangerous goods.” We only use carriers that meet applicable legal requirements. Beginning in the third quarter of 2025, the shipment of used and waste batteries will be subject to the new EU Battery Regulation 2023/1542, requiring us to keep documentation on hand to allow authorities to distinguish between the shipments of used and waste batteries. We have policies and programs in place to help assure compliance with our obligations such as machine guarding, laser welding, hazardous material management and transportation. Furthermore, in order to obtain existing building permits, we are obligated to perform environmental compliance and fire protection concept requirements under German regulations. All these standards and certificates are designed to comply with applicable government regulations and laws, as well as the standards of the automotive industry.
We train our employees and conduct internal audits of our operations to assess our fulfillment of these policies. As demonstrated in our pilot project for “Sustainable Battery Production” with TÜV SÜD Germany, the environment is very important to us. Therefore, we are confident in our ability to timely meet the upcoming European regulatory obligations with regard to the environmental and sustainability requirements applicable to battery manufacturers.
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters — Our U.S. Production Facility 
Federal, state and local regulations impose significant environmental, health, and safety requirements on the manufacture, storage, transportation and disposal of various components as currently used or that will be used in our U.S. battery cell manufacturing and ESS container assembly operations. On the federal level, various agencies regulate the manufacture, storage, transportation, and disposal of batteries, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), and the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”). Battery manufacturing facilities must follow the EPA’s Battery Manufacturing Effluent Guidelines and Standards, which are incorporated into the EPA’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System’s (“NPDES”) permitting regulations. NPDES permits are required for direct dischargers of certain battery manufacturing waste. In addition to providing general industrial safety regulations, OSHA also dictates specific safety requirements for workers in the battery manufacturing and battery charging industries. On the transportation side, lithium batteries are regulated as a hazardous material under the DOT’s Hazardous Materials Regulations (“HMR”) and must conform to all applicable HMR requirements when transported by air, highway, rail, or water. In addition, U.S. state and local laws can impose additional regulations, particularly in the areas of safety, recycling, and proper handling of batteries. 
Moreover, federal, state and local governments may in the future enact additional regulations relating to the manufacture, storage, transportation and disposal of components of advanced ESS. Compliance with such additional regulations could require us to devote significant time and resources and could adversely affect demand for our products.

As we continue to develop our operations in the U.S. we are following international standards and guidelines as we develop our Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Management systems. Although we believe that our operations are in material compliance with current applicable environmental regulations, there can be no assurance that changes in such laws and regulations will not impose costly compliance requirements on us or otherwise subject us to future liabilities. 
General Environmental Matters
Currently, we face no admonitions, penalties, investigations, or inquiries from environmental regulators, nor are we involved in any legal proceedings as a defendant for violating environmental laws. We have no reason to anticipate any claims, actions, or proceedings against us related to environmental law that would materially and adversely affect our business, finances, or operations. See “
Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business and Industry — Compliance with environmental regulations can be expensive, and failure to comply with these regulations may result in monetary damages and fines, adverse publicity and have a material adverse effect on our business.
”
Workers’ Health and Production Safety Compliance
We are subject to numerous laws and regulations related to the health of our employees and production safety of our facilities in each jurisdiction in which we operate. 
These laws and regulations include in some jurisdictions a requirement to engage a qualified institution to make a safety evaluation report on its work safety conditions and to file such a safety evaluation report with the local work safety authority for the use of hazardous chemicals in our manufacturing process.
We are not currently subject to any admonitions, penalties, investigations or inquiries relating to workers’ health and production safety law or regulations, nor are we subject to any claims or legal proceedings to which we are named as a defendant for violation of any workers’ health and production safety law or regulation. We do not have any reasonable basis to believe that there are any threatened claims, actions or legal proceedings against us relating to any workers’ health and production safety law or regulation that would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See “
Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business and Industry — We may fail to comply with certain health and production safety laws and regulations governing hazardous materials.
