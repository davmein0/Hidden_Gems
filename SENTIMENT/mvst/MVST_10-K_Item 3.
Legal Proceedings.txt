CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
This annual report on Form 10-K (the “Annual Report”) contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements include, but are not limited to, statements about our future results of operations and financial position, our operational performance, our anticipated growth and business strategy, our future capital expenditures and debt service obligations, the projected costs, prospects and plans and objectives of management for future operations, including regarding expected growth and demand for our batteries and energy storage solutions and introduction of new batteries and energy storage solutions, the adoption of such offerings by customers, our expectations relating to backlog, pipeline and contracted backlog, our ability to implement our remediation plan in connection with the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, current expectations relating to legal proceedings and anticipated impacts and benefits from the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 as well as any other proposed or recently enacted legislation. In some cases, you may also identify forward-looking statements by words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” 

“estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “might,” “objective,” “plan,” “project,” “predict,” “outlook” “should,” “will,” “would,” or the negative of these terms, or other comparable terminology intended to identify statements about the future. Such forward-looking statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of management and are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond our control. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements.
In addition to factors identified elsewhere in this Annual Report, the following factors, among others, could cause actual results and the timing of events to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements:
•
our ability to remain a going concern;
•
risk that we may not be able to execute our growth strategies or achieve profitability;
•
risk that we may be unable to meet our future capital requirements and we may require additional capital to support our business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, or at all;
•
potential difficulties in maintaining manufacturing capacity and establishing expected mass manufacturing capacity in the future;
•
risks relating to delays, disruptions and quality control problems in our manufacturing operations; 
•
restrictions in our existing and any future credit facilities;

•
changes in the highly competitive market in which we compete, including with respect to our competitive landscape, technology evolution or regulatory changes;
•
changes in availability and price of raw materials;
•
labor relations, including the ability to attract, hire and retain key employees and contract personnel;
•
heightened awareness of environmental issues and concern about global warming and climate change;
•
risk that we are unable to secure or protect our intellectual property;

risk that our customers or third-party suppliers are unable to meet their obligations fully or in a timely manner;
•
risks related to possible future reductions in pricing or order volume or loss of one or more of our significant customers;

•
risk that our customers will adjust, cancel or suspend their orders for our products;
•
risks relating to our ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers;
•
risks related to our lengthy sales cycle for our products;
•
risk of product liability or regulatory lawsuits or proceedings relating to our products or services;

our ability to maintain and enhance our reputation and brand recognition;

changing laws regarding cybersecurity and data privacy, and any cybersecurity threat or event;

the effects and associated cost of compliance with existing and future laws and governmental regulations, such as the IRA;
•
risks relating to whether renewable energy technologies are suitable for widespread adoption or if sufficient demand for our offerings does not develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipate; 
•
economic, financial and other impacts such as a pandemic, including global supply chain disruptions; and 
•
the impacts of geopolitical events, including the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East.
Actual results, performance or achievements may differ materially, and potentially adversely, from any forward-looking statements and the assumptions on which those forward-looking statements are based. There can be no assurance that the data contained herein is reflective of future performance to any degree. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a predictor of future performance as forward-looking statements are based on estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to various significant risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.
All information set forth herein speaks only as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of developments occurring after the date hereof except as may be required under applicable securities laws. Forecasts and estimates regarding our industry and end markets are based on sources we believe to be reliable, however, there can be no assurance these forecasts and estimates will prove accurate in whole or in part.
