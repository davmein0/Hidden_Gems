The Business 
Microvast Holdings, Inc. is an advanced battery technology company, headquartered in Stafford, Texas, and publicly traded on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol MVST. We specialize in the design, development, and manufacturing of battery components and systems primarily for electric commercial vehicles and utility-scale energy storage systems ("ESS").
Founded in 2006, Microvast was built on a guiding principle that remains central to our mission today: to innovate lithium-ion battery designs without relying on past technologies. We call this true innovation. We started without preconceived notions of lithium-ion battery creation, unlike many companies that repurposed legacy technologies for new markets like electric vehicles – a process we consider product development rather than true innovation.  To understand this difference is to understand what we have set out to achieve.
Our mission is to accelerate the global transition to electrification by delivering innovative battery solutions that support the adoption of electric vehicles and renewable energy. A key strategic focus is to be in a position to lead U.S. domestic battery production, reducing reliance on overseas suppliers, and strengthening national energy independence. We believe continuous investment in our technology and operations will deliver long-term targeted revenue and income growth.
Through a vertically integrated approach, we have developed proprietary technologies spanning the entire battery system—from the core materials of a battery cell (cathode, anode, electrolyte, separator) to thermal management systems and advanced software controls. Our expertise has driven advancements in ultra-fast charging, high energy density, long lifespan, and safety—critical factors for commercial transportation and ESS applications.
We are expanding our production of battery systems and components, with an increased emphasis on ESS solutions to support the broader shift to electrification. Our goal is to become a global leader in ESS, bridging the gap between EVs and renewable energy. 
One of our recent innovations is our high-energy nickel manganese cobalt ("NMC") 53.5 ampere-hour battery cell (the “53.5Ah”). We believe its advanced performance characteristics make it an optimal solution for both commercial vehicle and ESS applications. To bring this product to market, we have made substantial investments in capacity expansion in Huzhou, China, where we operate fully automated production equipment that delivers significant operational efficiencies.

In previous years, we made significant investments in our capacity expansion in Clarksville, Tennessee and by the fourth quarter of 2023 had started to install certain sections of the production line. However, progress on certain third party construction workstreams as well as taking delivery and possession of further equipment started to be impacted toward the end of the fourth quarter of 2023 due to the required funding to complete the project not being secured. Ultimately, in the second quarter of 2024, we paused construction efforts on the Clarksville development due to insufficient funding. We made a strategic decision to pivot from the originally planned production of NMC production in Clarksville, Tennessee to the 565Ah lithium iron phosphate ("LFP")  battery. We also consolidated our ESS operations previously in Colorado to Clarksville, Tennessee in order to enhance operational efficiencies and speed of deliveries for our U.S. business.
In August 2024, we introduced the ME6 ESS, featuring the LFP battery. The shift toward LFP technology for the U.S. ESS market is a strategic decision. The ME6 system offers a cycle life exceeding 10,000 cycles, a lifespan of up to 30 years, compact storage capabilities (6 megawatt hours ("MWh") in a 21-foot container), and enhanced reliability through IP55, C4, and nitrogen protection features. The adoption of LFP batteries provides lower costs, greater safety, and environmental benefits compared to NMC technology, further supporting our sustainability goals. Although construction progress has been negatively impacted by funding constraints, our goal is that our Clarksville, Tennessee facility will be our major production facility for LFP cells pending financing and facility completion. 
In January 2025, we announced what we believe is a major breakthrough in solid-state battery technology. This innovation represents a paradigm shift, delivering higher energy density for extended range and improved efficiency, enhanced safety by eliminating risks associated with thermal runaway, and faster charging capabilities with an extended cycle life. We plan to make substantial investments in research and development ("R&D") to accelerate commercialization, with applications spanning EVs, grid storage, and high-performance energy systems.
 For the year ended December 31, 2024, our revenue increased by $73.2 million, reaching $379.8 million, a 24% year-over-year increase. Additionally, our order backlog stood at $401.3 million, with the majority of these orders expected to be fulfilled in 2025 and 2026. As we continue to expand production capacity and advance next-generation battery technologies, we remain committed to driving electrification, fostering innovation, and supporting long-term sustainable growth.
We remain committed to driving battery innovation, scaling global production, and delivering high-performance sustainable energy solutions that power the future of mobility and energy storage.

Going Concern
In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements – Going Concern, the Company evaluates whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, 
58
Table of Contents
that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the consolidated financial statements are issued. This evaluation includes considerations related to liquidity and capital resources.
In prior periods, the Company disclosed that substantial doubt existed about its ability to continue as a going concern, due to uncertainties related to liquidity, capital requirements, and operating losses.
However, during the third and fourth quarters of the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company achieved positive operating income, reflecting meaningful progress toward sustainable profitability. This improvement was driven by increased customer demand, improved gross margins, and reduced operating expenses, which have positively impacted the Company’s liquidity position.
Based on this recent operating performance, current cash balances, available funding sources, and management’s expectations regarding future operations and capital needs, the Company has concluded that it is probably that their plans will alleviate substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern for at least twelve months from the issuance date of these consolidated financial statements. For additional detail, refer to Note 
2
 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.
Subsequent Events
See Note 29 to the audited consolidated financial statements of this Annual Report.
Smaller Reporting Company
We are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30th, or (2) our annual revenues equaled or exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th.
Key Factors Affecting Our Performance
Our future success depends on several critical factors, including those outlined below. While these represent opportunities for growth, they also pose challenges and risks that we must effectively manage to sustain our business momentum and improve financial performance.
Technology and Product Innovation 
Our financial performance is driven by development and sales of new products with innovative technology. Our ability to develop innovative technology has been and will continue to be dependent on our dedicated research team. As part of our efforts to develop innovative technology, in October 2021, we expanded our R&D footprint in Orlando by purchasing a 75,000 square foot facility dedicated to R&D. We plan to continue expanding our R&D presence in the U.S. We also plan to continue leveraging our knowledge base in our overseas locations, including China and to continue expanding our R&D efforts on a global basis. We expect our results of operations will continue to be impacted by our ability to develop new products with improved performance and reduced ownership cost, as well as the cost of our R&D efforts.
Market Demand
Our revenue and profitability depend substantially on the demand for battery systems and battery components, which is driven by the growth of the commercial and passenger electric vehicle and energy storage markets. Many factors contribute to the development of the electric vehicle and battery energy storage sector, including product innovation, general economic and political conditions, environmental concerns, energy demand, government support and economic incentives(e.g., the IRA in the U.S. and the E.U. Green Deal, E.U. Fit for 55). While governmental economic incentives and mandates can drive market demand for the markets in which we operate and, as a result, battery systems and components, governmental economic incentives can always be gradually reduced or eliminated. Any reduction or 
59
Table of Contents
elimination of governmental economic incentives may result in reduced demand for our products and adversely affect our financial performance.
Manufacturing Capacity
Our growth depends on being able to meet anticipated demand for our products. In order to do this, we will need to increase our manufacturing capacity. As of December 31, 2024, we had a backlog of approximately $401.3 million for our battery systems. So far we have used $475.4 million of the proceeds from the Business Combination to expand our manufacturing facilities in order to increase our manufacturing output, enabling us to address our backlog and to capture growing market opportunities.
In the third quarter of 2023, we successfully completed the 2 GWh cell, module and tray capacity expansion for our 53.5Ah cell technology in Huzhou, China.  The demand for our 53.5Ah cell technology from our commercial vehicle customer base will be primarily met from this facility. 
Without access to financing, we are unable to progress the Clarksville expansion project on its intended timetable, and further progress is still contingent on having full access to funding to complete the remaining project work.
Future capacity expansions, will require significant capital expenditures and will require a corresponding expansion of our supporting infrastructure, further development of our sales and marketing team, an expansion of our customer base and strengthened quality control. This capacity expansion will be carried out in a measured manner based on our ongoing assessment of medium- and long-term demand for our solutions.
Sales Geographic Mix 
After initially being focused on the Asia & Pacific regions, we have expanded and continue to expand our presence and product promotion to Europe and the U.S. to capitalize on the rapidly growing electric vehicle and battery energy storage markets in those geographies. As we continue to expand our geographic focus to Europe and the U.S., we believe sales of our products in Europe and the U.S. will have the potential to generate higher gross margins because average sales prices for customers in the U.S. and Europe are typically significantly higher than the average sales prices in China. It has been our experience that buyers in Europe and the U.S. are more motivated by the technologies and quality of our products than are buyers in China, making them less sensitive to the price of our products than are similarly situated buyers in China where we are also faced with intense competition from local Chinese battery manufacturers. Therefore, the geographic sources of our revenue will have an impact on our revenue and gross margins.
Manufacturing Costs
Our profitability may also be affected by our ability to effectively manage our manufacturing costs. Our manufacturing costs are affected by fluctuations in the price of raw materials. If raw material prices increase, we will have to offset these higher costs either through price increases to our customers or through productivity improvements. Our ability to control our raw materials costs is also dependent on our ability to negotiate with our suppliers for a better price and our ability to source raw materials from reliable suppliers in a cost-efficient manner. In addition, we expect that an increase in our sales volume will enable us to lower our manufacturing costs through economies of scale.
Regulatory Landscape
The battery industry is subject to stringent and evolving environmental regulations, particularly concerning hazardous waste management, pollution control, and sustainability requirements. Over time, these regulations have become increasingly strict, impacting both product costs and gross margins. Compliance with these standards requires continuous investment in manufacturing processes, material sourcing, and waste disposal practices to ensure adherence to environmental mandates across multiple jurisdictions.
Additionally, government policies and economic incentives play a critical role in shaping demand for electric vehicles (EVs) and energy storage systems (ESS). Incentives such as EV purchase subsidies, tax credits for battery manufacturers, and renewable energy project grants have historically supported market growth. Similarly, carbon emission penalties and fleet-wide regulatory requirements for automakers further drive the adoption of zero-emission transportation and clean energy solutions. These policies expand our total addressable market, creating opportunities for increased sales and broader adoption of our battery technologies. However, changes in these incentives—such as reductions or eliminations of subsidies—could negatively affect demand for our products.

Table of Contents
As a global company with operations and sales in China, the Asia-Pacific region, Europe, and the U.S., we are also exposed to trade policies, tariffs, and regulatory shifts that could impact our ability to meet projected sales and maintain profit margins. Any significant changes in international trade agreements, supply chain restrictions, or geopolitical tensions may influence production costs, material sourcing, and cross-border sales strategies. Navigating these regulatory complexities is essential to sustaining our competitive position and long-term growth trajectory.

Table of Contents
Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses consist of selling and marketing, general and administrative (G&A), and research and development (R&D) expenses.
Selling and marketing expenses.
 Selling and marketing expenses include personnel-related costs for our sales and marketing teams, including salaries, stock-based compensation, and commission-based incentives. These expenses also cover advertising, promotional activities, and customer engagement efforts to drive product awareness and sales growth. As we continue to expand, we plan to hire additional sales personnel, enhance marketing programs, and strengthen customer relationships. Consequently, selling and marketing expenses are expected to increase in absolute dollar terms over the long term.
General and administrative expenses.
 General and administrative expenses primarily comprise personnel-related costs for our executive, legal, finance, human resources, and IT teams, along with professional service fees, depreciation, amortization, and insurance costs. As we scale operations, we anticipate additional expenditures for personnel hiring, infrastructure development, and compliance-related activities. These investments are necessary to support our anticipated growth and ensure operational efficiency.
R&D expenses.
 primarily include salaries and stock-based compensation for our engineers and scientists, as well as raw material costs for experimental development, utility expenses, and depreciation costs related to R&D activities. As we continue to invest in new product development, advanced battery technologies, and enhanced functionality, we expect R&D expenditures to increase in absolute dollar terms. These investments are critical to maintaining technological leadership and delivering next-generation battery solutions to the market.
Subsidy Income
Government subsidies represent government grants received from local government authorities. The amounts of and conditions attached to each subsidy were determined at the sole discretion of the relevant governmental authorities. Our subsidy income is non-recurring in nature.
Other Income and Expenses
Other income and expenses consist primarily of the interest expense associated with our debt financing arrangements, interest income earned on our cash balances, gains and losses from foreign exchange conversion, and gains and losses on disposal of assets.
Income Tax Expense
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we do business, namely China, Germany and the U.K. These foreign jurisdictions have statutory tax rates different from those in the U.S. Accordingly, our effective tax rates will vary depending on the relative proportion of foreign to U.S. income, the absorption of foreign tax credits, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from the examination of our tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities to determine the adequacy of our income tax reserves and expense. Should actual events or results differ from our current expectations, charges or credits to our income tax expense may become necessary. Any such adjustments could have a significant impact on our results of operations.
Income tax in China is generally calculated at 25% of the estimated assessable profit of our subsidiaries in China, except that two of our subsidiaries in China are qualified as “High and New Tech Enterprises” and thus enjoy a preferential income tax rate of 15%. The federal corporate income tax rate of 21% is applied for our U.S. entities. Our income tax in the U.K. is calculated at an average tax rate of 19% of the estimated assessable profit of our subsidiary in the U.K. The German enterprise income tax, which is a combination of corporate income tax and trade tax, is calculated at 29.1% of the estimated assessable profit of our subsidiary in Germany.

Revenue
Our revenue increased from $306.6 million in 2023 to $379.8 million in 2024, reflecting a 23.9% year-over-year (YoY) growth. This expansion was primarily driven by a 41.6% increase in sales volume, rising from 1,139.6 MWh in 2023 to 1,613.6 MWh in 2024.
The surge in volume was fueled by strong demand for our battery cell products from both new and existing customers across the Asia-Pacific and European markets. As we broadened our geographic footprint and strengthened customer relationships, our ability to scale production and meet rising demand contributed to this sustained growth.
Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit
Our cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024, increased by 4.4% compared to 2023, primarily due to higher sales volumes. However, this increase was significantly lower than the 23.9% year-over-year revenue growth, reflecting improved operational efficiency, cost controls, and economies of scale.
63
Table of Contents
As a result, our gross profit margin expanded from 18.7% in 2023 to 31.5% in 2024. This improvement was driven by higher production utilization, which enhanced the absorption of fixed costs. A more favorable product mix, with a growing share of higher-margin battery solutions, contributed to increased profitability. Additionally, lower raw material prices helped reduce input costs. These factors collectively highlight our ability to scale operations while improving profitability, positioning us for continued margin expansion and long-term financial growth.
Selling and Marketing
Selling and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024, decreased by $1.0 million (4.4%) compared to 2023. This reduction was primarily driven by a $2.1 million decrease in share-based compensation expenses and reductions of the U.S. headcount in Q2 2024, which was partially offset by continued investments in customer engagement and market expansion initiatives. 
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024, decreased by $15.3 million (15.8%) compared to 2023. This decline was primarily driven by a $24.4 million reduction in share-based compensation expenses, partially offset by higher legal and insurance costs.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024, decreased by $3.9 million (8.8%) compared to 2023. This reduction was primarily driven by a $5.0 million decrease in share-based compensation expenses, partially offset by a $1.8 million increase in personnel-related costs as we expanded our research team to support ongoing product development and innovation initiatives.
Impairment loss from long-lived assets
During the first half year of 2024, the Company decided to pause the construction of the battery plant in Clarksville, Tennessee until additional funding for the remaining capital expenditure is secured. The Company reassessed the recoverability of the long-lived assets in U.S.  For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized $93.2 million impairment losses which is mainly from the impairment of long-lived assets in U.S.
Subsidy Income
Subsidy income increased from $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 to $2.7 million in the same period in 2024. The amounts are the one-time awards granted by local governments in 2023 and 2024.
Gain on debt restructuring
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the company recorded a gain of $9.4 million on the payable concession.
Changes in fair value of warrant liability and convertible loan
For the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded a non-cash loss of $80.0 million, primarily related to the change in the fair value of our convertible loan. This includes a $79.7 million fair value adjustment on the convertible loan issued to a shareholder. The loss was primarily driven by a significant increase in our share price during the period, which raised the fair value of the loan's conversion feature. 
These instruments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, and their valuation requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The fair value changes do not impact our cash position or operating performance but have a material effect on our reported net income. As of December 31, 2024 the outstanding balance was $104.6 million.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Since inception, we have financed our operations primarily through capital contributions from equity holders, the issuance of convertible notes, and bank borrowings. As of December 31, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash totaling $109.6 million.
64
Table of Contents
Our consolidated net cash position of $109.6 million as of December 31, 2024, comprised $73.0 million in cash and cash equivalents, with $37.0 million held by our China subsidiary and $9.2 million held by our German and UK subsidiaries. These funds are not readily available for domestic operations unless repatriated. If we need to transfer any of these funds to the U.S. in the form of a dividend, we would be required to accrue and pay withholding taxes. However, we do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Instead, we plan to retain available funds and future earnings to support our ongoing operations and expansion efforts in China, the E.U., and the U.S.
In accordance with Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-15, “Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40),” management has evaluated whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date of the consolidated financial statements are issued and has determined that  our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to generate cash from future operations and additional capital. In light of operating requirements under our current business plan, we are projecting that the existing cash and assets available for sale and equity securities will not be sufficient to fund our operations through the next twelve months. These conditions and events raise substantial doubt about the our ability to continue as a going concern.
To alleviate the conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, management developed primary plans as described below.
•    
Forecasted cash inflow from operations
 - For the year ended December 31, 2024, we generated cash flow of $2.8 million from operating activities. In the forecasted period, we have order backlog of $401.3 million, with the majority of these orders expected to be fulfilled in 2025 and 2026. Additionally, we expected to generate higher gross margins because we will generate more revenue from Europe and the U.S with higher sales prices. We don't expect significant fluctuations in the gross margin considering the selling price secured by the contract backlogs and the market conditions of major raw materials. Thus, we believe that the operating cash flow in the forecasted period will continue to grow. 
•    
Refinancing of short-term bank borrowings
 - Historically, we have rolled over or obtained replacement borrowings from existing creditors for its short-term bank loans upon the maturity date of the loans if needed. For $37.1 million short-term bank borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2024 which we have successful refinancing experience, if needed, we will be able to refinance them  as they become due for the next twelve months.    In early 2025, the Company successfully refinanced loans of $12.3 million that matured.
Based on the above, we concluded that it is probable that these plans will alleviate substantial doubt about the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and that adequate sources of liquidity will exist to fund the working capital and capital expenditures requirements and to meet our short term debt obligations, and other liabilities and commitments as they become due. 
To enhance liquidity, we secured a $101.5 million bank loan during the year ended December 31, 2024 (see Note 12 – Bank Borrowings). Additionally, workforce reductions in the U.S. during the second and third quarters of 2024 have resulted in cost savings and improved cash flow.
Further strategies to strengthen liquidity include optimizing operations, asset sales, and evaluating funding options. The Company achieved income from operation in the second half of 2024, and continued execution of its business strategy is expected to support positive cash flow generation over the next twelve months. Additionally, the Group is actively pursuing the sale of non-core U.S. real estate assets, which is expected to enhance liquidity without affecting core operations.
Although no additional binding financing agreements have been entered into, the Group remains engaged in discussions with third parties to explore further capital-raising opportunities. Future capital requirements may change based on business developments, market conditions, and liquidity needs. The company continues to evaluate potential options, including equity offerings and debt financing, to ensure financial flexibility and long-term growth.
Financings
As of December 31, 2024, we had bank borrowings of $111.7 million, the terms of which range from one month to two years. The interest rates of our bank borrowings ranged from 3.25% to 4.85% per annum. As of December 31, 2024, we had convertible bonds of $43.2 million, with interest rates ranging from 3% to 4%. The convertible bonds are due in 2027. As of December 31, 2024, we also had the convertible loan with shareholder of $104.6 million outstanding at an initial interest rate equal to Term SOFR for the applicable interest period, plus an initial applicable margin of 9.75% per 
65
Table of Contents
annum, 3.75% of which shall be paid in kind and added to the outstanding principal under the convertible loan with shareholder, with the remaining interest to be paid in cash. See Note 26 for details. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all material terms and covenants of our loan agreements, credit agreements and bonds.
On July 23, 2021, we received $708.4 million from the completion of the Business Combination, $705.1 million net of transaction costs paid by Microvast, Inc. We have used $475.4 million of the net proceeds from the Business Combination to expand our manufacturing facilities and for the purchase of property and equipment associated with our existing manufacturing and R&D facilities.  In addition, $185.6 million of the net proceeds were used for working capital as of December 31, 2024.
Although no additional binding financing agreements have been entered into, the Group remains engaged in discussions with third parties to explore further capital-raising opportunities. Future capital requirements may change based on business developments, market conditions, and liquidity needs. The company continues to evaluate potential options, including equity offerings and debt financing, to ensure financial flexibility and long-term growth.  
The exercise price for our outstanding warrants is $11.50 per share of common stock, and the trading price of our common stock was $1.27 as of March 24, 2025. There is no guarantee that the warrants will be exercised prior to their expiration, however, we do not expect this to impact our liquidity.
Capital expenditures and other contractual obligations
Our capital expenditures amounted to $49.9 million and $186.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our capital expenditures in 2024 and 2023 related primarily to the construction of manufacturing facilities under our Clarksville expansion and Huzhou, China.
In 2021, we started our capacity expansion plans in Huzhou, China, Berlin, Germany and Clarksville, Tennessee. The project in Germany was completed in 2021. The China Phase 3.1 capacity expansion was successfully completed in the third quarter of 2023. 
Because of delays in securing additional financing, in the fourth quarter of 2023 we began experiencing slow progress in continuing construction of our Clarksville expansion, slowing down certain construction work streams due to the need for additional financing. This facility was initially intended to produce 53.5Ah cells for our ESS solutions; however, we believe that LFP cells are better suited for our ESS solutions and intend to utilize the Tennessee facility to produce LFP cells instead of 53.5Ah cells. Additionally, our ESS products that were previously developed and assembled in Colorado are now planned to be assembled at our Tennessee facility once the facility is completed. The proceeds from the Business Combination alone will not be sufficient to complete the Clarksville expansion and meet our general working capital needs and due to foreign restrictions and adverse tax consequences as well as the working capital needs of Microvast Power Systems Co. Ltd., we are unable to repatriate cash from China to pay our accounts payable in the U.S. and fund the continued expansion of our U.S. operations. We are seeking alternate sources of capital. Until financing is in place, this will limit our growth opportunities, especially in the U.S. market where our customers desire products that meet their domestic content requirements. We are seeking to secure financing to complete the Tennessee facility. 
Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to funding planned production capacity expansions and for general working capital. In addition, we may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or technologies. We may need to seek additional equity or debt financing in order to meet these future capital requirements. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, or on terms that are acceptable to us, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. There are no material off-balance sheet arrangements other than those described below. 
Lease Commitments
We lease certain facilities and equipment under non-cancellable lease agreements that expire at various dates through 2036.  For additional information, see Note 17 – Leases, in the notes to the audited condensed consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Report on Form 10-K.

Table of Contents
Purchase Commitments
We regularly enter into non-cancelable contractual obligations primarily related to purchases of inventory. As of December 31, 2024, such purchase commitments, which do not qualify for recognition on our consolidated balance sheets, amount to $48.2 million, most of which is short-term.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2024, our operating activities generated $2.8 million in cash, compared to a cash outflow of $75.3 million in 2023 . The positive operating cash flow in 2024 was primarily driven by non-cash adjustments and changes in working capital, offsetting the net loss for the year.
In 2024, our net loss totaled $195.5 million, offset by $251.0 million in non-cash charges, including $30.1 million in depreciation of property, plant, and equipment, $30.8 million in non-cash share-based compensation, $93.2 million in impairment losses from property, plant and equipment, and $80.0 million in fair value changes related to warrants and convertible loans. However, operating assets and liabilities resulted in a $52.7 million cash outflow, mainly due to a $0.5 million increase in inventories, a $13.2 million decrease in accrued liabilities and prepaid expenses, and a $54.4 million reduction in accounts payable and notes payable, partially offset by a $15.3 million net decrease in accounts receivable and notes receivable and a $0.1 million increase in other operating assets and liabilities.
In 2023, operating activities used $75.3 million in cash, driven by a net loss of $106.4 million and $109.6 million in non-cash adjustments, including $22.1 million in depreciation and $65.0 million in share-based compensation. A $78.5 million decrease in cash flows from operating assets and liabilities contributed to the cash outflow, primarily due to a $47.1 million increase in accounts receivable and notes receivable, a $74.4 million increase in inventories, and a $7.7 million decrease in accrued liabilities and prepaid expenses, partially offset by a $65.1 million increase in accounts payable and notes payable.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2024, cash used in investing activities totaled $12.2 million, a significant reduction compared to previous years. This outflow was primarily driven by $27.7 million in capital expenditures related to the expansion of our manufacturing facilities and the acquisition of property and equipment for existing manufacturing and R&D operations. These outflows were partially offset by $5.5 million in proceeds from the maturity of short-term investments and $10.0 million from the disposal of property, plant, and equipment.
During the year ended December 31, 2023, cash used in investing activities totaled $165.6 million, primarily due to $186.8 million in capital expenditures for manufacturing expansion and R&D infrastructure, along with $5.9 million in short-term investment purchases. These were partially offset by $25.5 million in proceeds from the maturity of short-term investments and $1.6 million from the disposal of property, plant, and equipment.
The significant reduction in investing cash outflows in 2024 reflects a measured approach to capital expenditures, as we continue to align investment decisions with available funding and strategic growth priorities.

Table of Contents
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2024, cash generated by financing activities totaled $37.6 million. This inflow was primarily driven by $101.5 million in proceeds from bank borrowings and $25.0 million in proceeds from a convertible loan. These were partially offset by $66.2 million in repayments on bank borrowings, $0.5 million in debt costs related to the convertible loan, and $22.2 million in deferred payments for property, plant, and equipment purchases.
During the year ended December 31, 2023, cash generated by financing activities totaled $33.0 million. This was primarily attributable to $47.8 million in proceeds from bank borrowings, partially offset by $14.1 million in repayments on bank borrowings and a $0.7 million partial repayment on outstanding bonds.
The increase in financing activities in 2024 reflects our efforts to secure additional funding through bank borrowings and convertible loans, supporting ongoing operational and strategic initiatives.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.
We believe the following critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policies. Therefore, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
In accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment ("ASC 360"), we review long-lived assets such as property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets, and an impairment loss is recorded as a component of operating expenses. Fair value is estimated based on various valuation techniques. For assets held for sales, the amount of potential impairment may be based upon appraisal of the asset, estimated market value of similar assets or estimated cash flow from the disposition of the asset. The evaluation of asset impairment requires us to make assumptions about future cash flows over the life of the asset being evaluated. These assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed and estimated amounts.
Convertible loan with shareholder
We elected the fair value option to account for the convertible loan with shareholder and records changes in fair value in the consolidated statements of operations, with the exception of changes in fair value due to instrument-specific credit risk which, if present, will be recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Interest expense related to the convertible loan is included in the changes in fair value.  The fair value of the convertible loan with shareholder was determined by using a discounted cash flow model for the bond component and a Black-Scholes-Merton model for the conversion option, which is considered a Level 3 fair value measurement.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the weighted average method. Inventory levels are analyzed periodically and written down to their net realizable value if they have become obsolete, have a cost basis in excess of expected net realizable value or are in excess of expected demand. We analyze current and future product demand relative to the remaining product life to identify potential excess inventories. These forecasts of future demand are based upon historical trends and analysis as adjusted for overall market conditions. Inventory write-downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and its net realizable value, and charged to inventory reserves, which is a component of cost of revenue. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for those inventories is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. We recorded inventory impairment losses of $3.3 million and 
68
Table of Contents
$3.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We monitor the inventory impairments periodically and, since battery technology continues to advance, we may incur inventory impairment losses in the future.
Income Taxes
We utilize the asset and liability method in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax expense or benefit is the result of changes in the deferred tax asset and liability. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets where it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We make estimates, assumptions and judgments to determine its provision for its income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. We assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income, and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we established a valuation allowance.
We account for uncertain tax positions by reporting a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Tax benefits are recognized from uncertain tax positions when we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
Stock-Based Compensation
We recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period that awards are expected to vest, based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of the grant. We recognize forfeitures as they occur. Fair value excludes the effect of non-market based vesting conditions. The fair value of RSUs with service conditions is based on the grant date share price. We estimate the fair value of options utilizing the Binomial-Lattice Model. The fair value of non-vested shares that vest based on market conditions are estimated using the Monte Carlo valuation method. These fair value estimates of stock related awards and assumptions inherent therein are estimates and, as a result, may not be reflective of future results or amounts ultimately realized by recipients of the grants. For these awards with performance conditions, we recognize compensation expense when the performance goals are achieved, or when it becomes probable that the performance goals will be achieved. Management performs the probability assessment on a quarterly basis by reviewing external factors, such as macroeconomic conditions and the analog industry revenue forecasts, and internal factors, such as our business and operational objectives and revenue forecasts. Changes in the probability assessment of achievement of the performance conditions are accounted for in the period of change by recording a cumulative catch-up adjustment as if the new estimate had been applied since the service inception date. As a result, our stock-based compensation expense is subject to volatility and may fluctuate significantly each quarter due to changes in our probability assessment of achievement of the performance conditions or actual results being different from projections made by management. Liability-classified awards are remeasured at lower of capped value or fair value as of each report date during settlement.
Loss of Emerging Growth Company Status
Under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies are exempt from complying with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies are required to do so. The JOBS Act also allows companies to opt out of this extended transition period and follow the same reporting requirements as non-emerging growth companies, an election that is irrevocable once made.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company no longer qualifies as an emerging growth company. Consequently, we are now required to comply with new or revised accounting standards on the same timeline as public companies and are subject to the full regulatory and reporting requirements applicable to non-emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act.
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
The information required by this Item regarding internal control over financial reporting is set forth in Part II, Item 9A of this Annual Report.

Table of Contents
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
See Note 2 to the audited consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-14 of this Annual Report for more information about recent accounting pronouncements, the timing of their adoption, and our assessment, to the extent we have made one, of their potential impact on our financial condition and its results of operations and cash flows.
ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Interest Rate Risk
Our cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of cash deposits and money market accounts, which are subject to interest rate fluctuations. While these interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk, historical fluctuations in interest income have not been material.
Our bonds payable bear fixed interest rates and are not publicly traded, limiting exposure to interest rate volatility. However, our project finance loans in China include an interest rate spread of 115 basis points over the Loan Prime Rate (LPR) in China, making them sensitive to market interest rate changes. Future movements in benchmark interest rates could materially impact our interest expenses.
The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while optimizing returns, without significantly increasing risk. Due to the short maturity of our cash equivalents, our portfolio remains relatively insensitive to interest rate fluctuations. We do not anticipate that a 100-basis-point increase or decrease in interest rates would have a material impact on our operating results or financial condition. We will continue to review and adjust our investment policy as needed to ensure it aligns with our risk management strategy and financial objectives.
Foreign Currency Risk
Given our significant operational presence in China, a large portion of our transactions is denominated in RMB. The volatility of exchange rates is influenced by multiple macroeconomic factors, making it difficult to predict future fluctuations with certainty.
We have experienced, and will likely continue to experience, fluctuations in our operating results due to foreign exchange gains and losses. These fluctuations arise from the translation of cash balances, trade accounts receivable and payable, and intercompany balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, primarily RMB.
A hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates for RMB-denominated accounts as of December 31, 2024, including intercompany balances, would have resulted in a foreign currency loss of approximately $15.2 million. As our foreign sales and expenses increase, our operating results may be further impacted by exchange rate fluctuations.
At present, we do not utilize foreign exchange hedging instruments, but we may consider implementing derivative or financial instruments in the future to mitigate currency risk. However, the potential impact of such hedging activities on our financial performance remains uncertain.
Credit Risk
Our credit risk primarily relates to trade receivables, restricted cash, cash equivalents, and amounts due from related parties. We typically extend credit only to customers and counterparties with strong credit ratings and actively monitor overdue accounts to minimize default risk.
Our evaluation of credit risk exposure involves significant estimates and judgment. Holding other factors constant, a hypothetical 100-basis-point increase in the expected loss rate on our financing receivables portfolio would have resulted in an increase in the allowance for credit losses of approximately $0.6 million as of December 31, 2024.
To mitigate credit risk, we have a dedicated credit management team responsible for establishing credit limits, approving credit terms, and implementing collection strategies. At each reporting period, we review the recoverability of outstanding balances and ensure that adequate impairment provisions are recorded for potentially uncollectible amounts. If necessary, we negotiate revised payment terms or settlement plans with customers facing financial difficulties.
70
Table of Contents
Given our robust credit risk management practices, we consider our overall credit risk exposure to be significantly mitigated.
Seasonality
Historically, we have observed higher sales volumes in the third and fourth fiscal quarters, compared to the first and second quarters. However, due to our relatively limited operating history, it remains difficult to determine the exact extent or nature of seasonality in our business. We continue to monitor sales trends and market conditions to better understand the potential impact of seasonal demand fluctuations on our operations.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Microvast Holdings, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Microvast Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “
Company
”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and the schedule listed in Schedule I (collectively referred to as the “
financial statements
”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB"), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 31, 2025, expressed an adverse opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting because of a material weakness identified.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Going concern – refer to Note 2 of the Financial Statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, there are conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans including generation of cash inflows from operations and refinancing of short-term bank borrowings in the next twelve months since the date of issuance of the financial statements to alleviate the substantial doubt are also described in Note 2.  
We identified the evaluation of the Company's assessment of its ability to continue as a going concern as a critical audit matter because a high degree of auditor judgment was required to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions related to the Company’s cash flow forecast used in its going concern analysis. 
F-2
Table of Contents
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the Company’s going concern included the following, among others:
•
We tested the effectiveness of internal controls over the Company's going concern assessment and forecasted cash flows.
•
We performed a retrospective review to compare the Company's historical forecasted cash flows to actual results to assess the Company's ability to accurately forecast. 
•
We assessed the reasonableness of the underlying data and assumptions included in management's forecasted cash flows.
•
We performed sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of changes in the key assumptions such as revenue growth rate and gross margin ratio. 
•
We inspected the terms of loan agreements to determine whether any covenants have been breached and whether the repayment within the next twelve months are properly included in the forecast.
•
We evaluated the reasonableness of the Company’s assessment that the management plans are probable to alleviate the substantial doubt.
•
We reviewed subsequent events to identify those that represent additional conditions and events to be considered in aggregate and whether any contradictory evidence exists.
Impairment of Long-lived assets – refer to Note 2 and Note 6 of the Financial Statements. 
Critical Audit Matter Description
As discussed in Note 2 and 6 to the financial statements, during the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company paused the construction of the battery plant in Clarksville, Tennessee, the United States, until additional funding for the remaining capital expenditure is secured. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s net value of the building and auxiliary equipment in Clarksville (“Clarksville Property”) is approximately $140 million. The Company assessed and concluded that the undiscounted cash flows indicate that the carrying value of Clarksville Property will not be recoverable. As a result, the Company utilized the residual method to estimate its fair value, with the assistance of an independent valuer. The Company recognized $57 million impairment of the Clarksville Property equaling the excess of the Clarksville Property’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value for the year ended December 31, 2024.
Auditing the Company's impairment assessment was complex due to the significant estimation and judgement required to evaluate the market and economic conditions as well as the degree of subjectivity involved in determining the indicative market value of the asset group. The Company developed its significant assumptions such as gross development value, indirect cost, development profit.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the impairment of property, plant and equipment included the following, among others:
•
We tested the effectiveness of the key controls over the impairment assessment of this property, plant and equipment.
•
We evaluated the independent valuer’s objectivity, competence and capabilities.
•
With the involvement of our fair value specialists, we performed the following:
i. Assessed the appropriateness of the valuation methodology and significant assumptions, such as gross    
development value, indirect cost, development profit.
ii. Tested the accuracy of mathematical calculation.
•
We assessed the reasonableness of the underlying data used by the Company such as remaining capital expenditure to complete the construction.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued
Going concern
The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Group will continue to realize its assets and settle its liabilities in the ordinary course of business. 
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Group incurred net losses of $
195,457
 (including a $
93,173
 impairment loss from property, plant and equipment and a $
79,960
 loss on changes in fair value of warrant liability and convertible loan), $
106,412
 and $
158,200
, and generated /(used) cash flows from /(in) operating activities amounting to $
2,814
, $(
75,303
), $(
53,928
), respectively.
As of December 31, 2024, the Group had working capital of $
97,873
, shareholders’ equity of $
387,895
 (including an accumulated deficit of $
1,092,958
), and cash and cash equivalents of $
73,007
. As of December 31, 2024, the Group held outstanding borrowings of $
111,728
, with $
70,666
 due within the next 12 months, and other current liabilities of $
259,487
, which include accounts payable, notes payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities. Additionally, as of December 31, 2024, the Group had $
48,242
 in purchase commitments primarily related to inventory, and $
53,228
 in capital commitments with $
30,713
 due within the next 12 months.
These conditions and events raise substantial doubt about the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Management’s primary plans to alleviate the substantial doubt are as described below.
•    
Forecasted cash inflow from operations
 - As of March 31, 2025, the Group has performed a review of its cash flow forecast for the twelve months ending March 31, 2026. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Group generated cash flow of $
2,814
 from its operating activities. The Group believes that its operating cash flow in the forecasted period will continue to grow. Management believes the forecast is based on reasonable assumptions including: i) there is no significant uncertainty on the execution of the existing contract backlog in the forecasted period, and ii) despite the potential fluctuation of the raw material prices, the gross margin in the forecasted period is not expected to significantly decline considering the selling price secured by the contract backlogs and the market conditions of major raw materials. 
•    
Refinancing of short-term bank borrowings
 - While there can be no assurance that the Group will be able to refinance its short-term bank borrowings as they become due, historically, the Group has rolled over or obtained replacement borrowings from existing creditors for its short-term bank loans upon the maturity date of the loans if needed. For $
37,083
 short-term bank borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2024 which the Company has successful refinancing experience, the Group assumed that it will continue to be able to do so for the next twelve months.
Below factors are considered by the management in assessing whether the plan is probable of being effectively implemented.
•    The refinancing of these loans have regularly occurred historically, even during the Group’s financially distressed periods.
•    These loans were borrowed by MPS, the Group’s main operating subsidiary. MPS generated profit and positive cash flow during the year ended December 31, 2024 and has shown improvement in operations comparing to the year ended December 31, 2023. 
•    In early 2025 the Group successfully refinanced loans of $
12,330
 that matured.
•    The Group has established long-term relationships with those banks and has never defaulted on repayments historically.
Based on the above, the Group concluded that it is probable that management’s plans will alleviate the substantial doubt about the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and that adequate sources of liquidity will exist to fund the Company’s working capital and capital expenditures requirements and to meet its short term debt obligations, and other liabilities and commitments as they become due. Therefore, the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or to the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Group not continue as a going concern.

For the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries, noncontrolling interests are recognized to reflect the portion of their equity that is not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the Company as the controlling shareholder. Noncontrolling interests are classified as a separate line item in the equity section of the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and have been separately disclosed in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss to distinguish the interests from that of the Company.
Use of estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Significant accounting estimates reflected in the Group’s financial statements include allowance for credit losses, provision for obsolete inventories, impairment of property, plant and equipment, valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, product warranties, fair value measurement of Bridge Notes, fair value measurement of warrant liability and share based compensation.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and highly liquid investments, which are unrestricted from withdrawal or use, or which have maturities of three months or less.
Restricted cash
Restricted cash represents deposits made to banks to secure bank acceptance notes (or Notes Payable), letters of credit issued by the Group, and restricted use bank borrowings (see Note 12). It is common in the PRC that the banks require the Group to pledge notes receivable or make a deposit as collateral. The deposits and the matured bank acceptance notes from its customers are recorded as restricted cash in the consolidated balance sheets.
Accounts receivable
Accounts receivable represents those receivables derived in the ordinary course of business, net of allowance for credit losses. Beginning on January 1, 2022, the Group evaluates its accounts receivable for expected credit losses on a regular basis. The Group maintains an estimated allowance for credit losses to reduce its accounts receivable to the amount that it believes will be collected. The Group uses the creditworthiness of customers, aging of the receivables, past transaction history with customers and their current condition, changes in customer payment terms, specific facts and circumstances, and the overall economic climate in the industries the Group serves to monitor the Group's receivables within the scope of expected credit losses model and use these as a basis to develop the Group's expected loss estimates.
Notes receivable and payable
The Group accepts bank acceptance notes (“notes”) from customers in the PRC in the normal course of business. These notes may be presented to banks in the PRC for cash settlement or endorsed to suppliers to settle accounts payable. The Group derecognizes the notes upon endorsement to suppliers, as it no longer retains control over instruments. Notes receivable and notes payable are typically non-interest bearing and have maturities of one year or less.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the balance of notes receivable were $
7,579
 and $
23,736
, respectively while certain notes receivable have been pledged to banks to secure their issuance of bank acceptance notes for the Group.

Short-term investments
The Group’s short-term held-to-maturity investments are classified based on their contractual maturity dates which are less than one year and are recorded at their amortized costs. The Company recognized $
3
, $
438
 and $
70
 interest income from the short-term investments for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
The Group reviews its held-to-maturity investments for other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) based on the specific identification method. The Group considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating the potential impairment of its short-term investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds the investment’s fair value, the Group considers, among other factors, general market conditions, expected future performance of the instruments, the duration and the extent to which the fair value of the investment is less than the cost, and the Group’s intent and ability to hold the investments. OTTI is recognized as a loss in the consolidated statements of operations.
Inventories, net
Inventories of the Group consist of raw materials, work in process and finished goods. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. 
Inventory costs include expenses that are directly or indirectly incurred in the acquisition and production process, including shipping and handling costs charged by suppliers. The cost of materials and supplies used in production, direct labor costs and allocated overhead costs are all included in the inventory costs
. The allocated overhead cost includes depreciation, insurance, employee benefits, and indirect labor. Cost is determined using the weighted average method. Inventories are written down to net realizable value taking into consideration of estimates of future demand, technology developments, market conditions and reasonably predicative costs of completion or disposal.
Prepaid expenses and other current assets
Prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily consist of advances to suppliers, prepaid expenses, deposits and value-added tax receivables.
Property, plant and equipment, net
Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives:
Buildings
20
 years
Machineries and equipment
10
 years
Fixtures and electronic equipment
4
 - 
5
 years
Motor vehicles
5
 years
Leasehold improvements
Shorter of the lease term or estimated useful lives
Construction in progress represents manufacturing facilities and equipment under construction, and is stated at cost. The capitalization of these costs ceases when construction in progress is transferred to property, plant and equipment and substantially ready for its intended use. No depreciation is recorded for construction in progress. Repair and maintenance costs are charged to expenses as incurred.
Land use rights, net
Land use rights are recorded at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives, which are generally 
50
 years and represent the shorter of the estimated usage periods or the terms of the land use rights agreements.

Acquired intangible assets, net
Acquired intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected useful economic lives.
Impairment of long-lived assets
In accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment ("ASC 360"), the Company reviews long-lived assets such as property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets, and an impairment loss is recorded as a component of operating expenses. Fair value is estimated based on various valuation techniques. For assets held for sales, the amount of potential impairment may be based upon appraisal of the asset, estimated market value of similar assets or estimated cash flow from the disposition of the asset. The evaluation of asset impairment requires the Company to make assumptions about future cash flows over the life of the asset being evaluated. These assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed and estimated amounts.
 Refer to Note 6 for details.
Assets held for sale
Assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of the carrying value or fair vale less cost to sell when the Company has committed to a sale agreement and would be reported separately as assets held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets.
Debt Restructuring
A debt restructuring is the modification of debt in which a creditor grants a concession it would not otherwise consider to a debtor that is experiencing financial difficulties. These modifications may include an extension of the maturity date, a reduction of the face amount or maturity amount of the debt, or a reduction of accrued interest.
 During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company entered into several settlement agreements with certain suppliers with payables, under which the Company received concessions that forgive certain contractually owed amounts and allow for deferred payment schedules. A restructuring gain of $
9,406
 on the payable concession was recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.
Fair value of financial instrument
Financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments, accounts receivable, notes receivable, other receivable, amounts due from/to related parties, accounts payable, short-term bank borrowings, notes payable, long-term bank borrowing, bonds payable, warrant liability and convertible loan with shareholder. The Group carries its cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash,  warrant liability and convertible loan with shareholder at fair value. The carrying values of other financial instruments approximate their fair values reported in the consolidated balance sheets.
Fair value
Fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Group considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.

Fair value - continued
Authoritative literature provides a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. An asset or liability categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement as follows:
Level 1
Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2
Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.
Level 3
Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
Convertible loan with shareholder measured at fair value
The Company has elected the fair value option to account for the convertible loan with shareholder described in Note 26 – Convertible loan with shareholder measured at fair value herein, and records changes in fair value in the consolidated statements of operations, with the exception of changes in fair value due to instrument-specific credit risk which, if present, will be recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Interest expense related to the convertible loan is included in the changes in fair value. As a result of applying the fair value option, direct costs and fees related to the convertible loan were expensed as incurred. Loss of $
79,737
 was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2024. The fair value of the convertible loan with shareholder was determined by using a discounted cash flow model for the bond component and a Black-Scholes-Merton model for the conversion option, which is considered a Level 3 fair value measurement.

Revenue recognition
Nature of Goods and Services
The Group’s revenue consists primarily of sales of lithium-ion batteries. The obligation of the Group is providing the battery products. Revenue is recognized at the point of time when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Group expects to be entitled to in exchange for the goods or services.
Contract balances
Contract balances include accounts receivable and advances from customers. Accounts receivable represent cash not received from customers and are recorded when the rights to consideration is unconditional. The allowance for credit losses reflects the best estimate of probable losses inherent to the accounts receivable balance. Contract liabilities, recorded in advance from customers in the consolidated balance sheet, represent payment received in advance.
 During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Group recognized  $
4,348
,  $
2,492
 and $
1,151
 of revenue previously included in advance from customers as of January 1, 2024, January 1, 2023 and January 1, 2022, respectively, which consist of payments received in advance related to its sales of lithium-ion batteries.

Value added taxes
The Group reports revenue net of VAT. Entities in PRC that are VAT general tax payers are allowed to offset qualified VAT paid against their output VAT liabilities.
Cost of revenues
Cost of revenues primarily consists of the cost of the products ultimately sold to customers, shipping and handling costs charged to the Group in the sales, product warranty expense, provision for obsolete inventories and other related cost that are directly attributable to the production of products.
Product Warranty
The Group provides product warranty, which entails repair or replacement of non-conforming items, in conjunction with the sales of products. The warranty liability recorded at each balance sheet date reflects management’s best estimates of its product warranty based on historical information and other currently available evidence.
The Group’s product warranty generally ranges from 
one
 to 
eight years
. The Group establishes a reserve for the estimated cost of the product warranty at the time revenue is recognized. The portion of the warranty that is expected to incur within the next 12 months is recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, while the remaining balance is recorded in other non-current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Product warranty is recorded as a cost of revenues.
Research and development expenses
Research and development expenses primarily consist of salaries and benefits for research and development personnel, raw materials, office rental expense, general expenses and depreciation expenses associated with research and development activities.
Subsidy income
Government subsidies represent government grants received from local government authorities.
Government subsidies related to the investment in production facilities is initially recorded as other current or other non-current liabilities and is amortized on a straight-line basis to offset the cost of revenues over the life of the relevant production assets or amortized on an effective interest method over the term of the loan.

The Group amortized the deferred subsidy at  $
620
, $
390
 and $
538
 during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the carrying amount of the current portion of the deferred subsidy income was $
1,026
 and $
531
, and the non-current portion was $
5,610
 and $
3,382
, respectively. 
Income taxes
Current income taxes are provided for in accordance with the laws of the relevant tax authorities. Deferred income taxes are recognized when temporary differences exist between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Net operating loss carry forwards and credits are applied using enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more-likely-than-not that a portion of or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
The Group accounts for uncertain tax positions by reporting a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Tax benefits are recognized from uncertain tax positions when the Group believes that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The Group recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

Share-based compensation
Share-based payment transactions with employees are measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity instrument and recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, with a corresponding impact reflected in additional paid-in capital.
For share-based awards granted with performance condition, the compensation cost is recognized when it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. The Company reassesses the probability of achieving the performance condition at the end of each reporting date and records a cumulative catch-up adjustment for any changes to its assessment. For performance-based awards with a market condition, such as awards based on total stockholder return (“TSR”), compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated service period of the award, regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.
Liability-classified awards are remeasured at their fair-value-based measurement as of each reporting date until settlement.
Leases
The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease or contains a lease at lease inception. Operating leases are required to be recorded in the statement of financial position as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments. The Company has elected the package of practical expedients, which allows the Company not to reassess (1) whether any expired or existing contracts as of the adoption date are or contain a lease, (2) lease classification for any expired or existing leases as of the adoption date and (3) initial direct costs for any expired or existing leases as of the adoption date. The Company also elected the practical expedient not to separate lease and non-lease components of contracts. Lastly, for lease assets other than real estate, such as printing machines and electronic appliances, the Company elected the short-term lease exemption as their lease terms are 12 months or less.
As the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, the Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is estimated in a portfolio approach to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments in a similar economic environment. Lease expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company recorded operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets of $
17,628
 and operating lease liabilities of $
17,635
, including current portion in the amount of $
3,039
, which was recorded under 
accrued expenses and other current liabilities
 on the balance sheet.
As for lessor accounting, the Company provides leasing arrangement to its customers primarily for the sale of vehicles. Revenue from the sale of these products under sales-type leases is recognized at the inception of the lease. Interest income on sales-type leases is recognized over the life of each respective lease using the interest method. As of December 31, 2024, the Company recorded net investment in sales-type leases of $
8,031
 including current portion in the amount of $
3,678
, which was recorded under accounts receivables on the balance sheet.
Warrant Liability 
The Company accounts for warrants in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815-40 under which the warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment and must be recorded as liabilities. As the Private Warrants (as defined below Note 15) meet the definition of a derivative as contemplated in ASC 815, the Company classifies the Private Warrants as liabilities. This liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until exercised, and any change in fair value is recognized in the statements of operations. The Private Warrants are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model on the basis of the quoted market price of the Company’s publicly-traded warrants.

Comprehensive loss
Comprehensive loss includes net loss and foreign currency translation adjustments. Comprehensive loss is reported in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.
Net loss per share
Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stock by the weighted average number of common stock outstanding during the year using the two-class method. Under the two-class method, any net loss is allocated between Common Stock and other participating securities based on their participating rights. Net loss is not allocated to participating securities when the participating securities do not have a contractual obligation to share losses.
Diluted loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss attributable to Common Stock by the weighted average number of Common Stock and dilutive Common equivalent stock outstanding during the period. Common equivalent stock consist of shares issuable upon the conversion of convertible bonds using the if-converted method, and Common Stock issuable upon the vesting of non-vested shares or exercise of outstanding share options (using the treasury stock method). Common equivalent stock are calculated based on the most advantageous conversion rate or exercise price from the standpoint of the security holder. Common equivalent stock are not included in the denominator of the diluted earnings per share calculation when inclusion of such shares would be anti-dilutive.
Foreign currencies
The functional currency of the Company and all subsidiaries located in the U.S. is the United States dollar (“U.S. dollar”). For the Company’s subsidiaries located in the PRC, the functional currency is the Chinese Renminbi (“RMB”); the Company’s UK subsidiary, MP UK, the functional currency is the Great British Pound (“Pound”); and the Company’s Germany subsidiary, MV GmbH, the functional currency is the Euro.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements of each individual group subsidiary, transactions in currencies other than the subsidiary’s functional currency (foreign currencies) are converted into the functional currency at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences on the monetary items are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which they arise.
For the purposes of presenting the consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are translated into the reporting currency of the Group (i.e. US$) at the prevailing exchange rate at the end of the reporting period, and their income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates for the year. Translation adjustments are reported as cumulative translation adjustments and are shown as a component of other comprehensive loss.
Foreign currency risk
RMB is not a freely convertible currency. The State Administration for Foreign Exchange, under the authority of the People’s Bank of China, controls the conversion of RMB into other currencies. The value of the RMB is subject to changes in central government policies and to international economic and political developments affecting supply and demand in the China Foreign Exchange Trading System market. Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of the Group included aggregate amounts of $
87,802
 and $
62,829
 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which were denominated in RMB.

Concentration of credit risk
Financial instruments that potentially expose the Group to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, notes receivable and short-term investments. The Group places its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions with high credit ratings and quality. The Group conducts credit evaluations of customers and generally does not require collateral or other security from its customers.

14. BONDS PAYABLE - continued
Huzhou Saiyuan Loan
On December 29, 2018, MPS signed an agreement with Huzhou Saiyuan, an entity established by the local government, to issue convertible bonds to Huzhou Saiyuan for a total consideration of $
87,776
 (RMB
600
 million). The Company pledged its 
12.39
% equity holding over MPS to Huzhou Saiyuan to facilitate the issuance of the convertible bonds.
If the subscribed bonds are not repaid by the maturity date of January 31, 2027, Huzhou Saiyuan has the right to dispose of the equity interests pledged by the Company in proportion to the amount of matured bonds, or convert the bonds into equity interests of MPS within 60 days after the maturity date. If Huzhou Saiyuan decides to convert the bonds into equity interests of MPS, the equity interests pledged would be released and the convertible bonds would be converted into equity interest of MPS based on an entity value of MPS of $
950,000
. 
In September 2020 and 2022, MPS entered into two supplement agreements with Huzhou Saiyuan, respectively, to change the repayment schedule as follows:  (i) $
14,629
 (RMB
100
 million) was repaid, together with interest accrued, on or before November 10, 2022, (ii) $
14,630
 (RMB
100
 million) was repaid, together with interest accrued, on or before December 31, 2022, and (iii) the remaining $
43,888
 (RMB
300
 million) will be repaid, together with interest accrued, on or before January 31, 2027. The applicable interest rate will be increased to 
12
% if the Group is in default on the repayment of the bonds at the due date. The remaining terms and conditions of the convertible bonds were unchanged. The Company has fully complied with the amended repayment schedule. With $
692
 (equivalent to RMB
5
 million) repaid in 2023, the outstanding balance of the convertible bonds was $
43,157
 (RMB
295
 million) as of December 31, 2024.
15. WARRANTS 
Upon the Merger, the Company assumed 
27,600,000
 publicly-traded warrants (“Public Warrants”) which were issued in connection with Tuscan’s initial public offering. The Company also assumed 
837,000
 private placement warrants issued to Tuscan Holdings Acquisition LLC ("Sponsor") and EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. (“EarlyBirdCapital”) (“Private Warrants” and together with the Public Warrants, the “Warrants”) upon the Merger, all of which were issued in connection with Tuscan’s initial public offering (other than  
150,000
 Private Warrants that were issued in connection with the closing of the Merger). The Warrants entitle the holder to purchase 
one
 share of the Company’s Common Stock at an exercise price of $
11.50
 per share. During the year ended December 31, 2024, none of the Public Warrants or the Private Warrants have been exercised.
The Public Warrants became exercisable 
30
 days after the completion of the Merger. No Warrants were exercisable for cash until the Company registered Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants with the SEC. Since the registration of Common Stock was not completed within 
90
 days following the Merger, warrant holders were able to exercise the Warrants on a net-share settlement basis until the registration statement became effective on June 8, 2022. The Public Warrants will expire 
five years
 after the completion of the Merger or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.
Once the Public Warrants became exercisable, the Company may redeem the Public Warrants:
•
in whole and not in part;
•
at a price of $
0.01
 per warrant;
•
upon not less than 
30
 days’ prior written notice of redemption;
•
if, and only if, the reported last sale price of the Company’s Common Stock equals or exceeds $
18.00
 per share for any 
20
-trading days within a 
30
-trading day period ending on the third business day prior to the notice of redemption to the warrant holders; and
•
if, and only if, there is a current registration statement in effect with respect to the shares of Common Stock underlying the warrants.
If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a net-share settlement basis.

(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share data, or as otherwise noted)
15. WARRANTS - continued
The Public Warrant was determined to be equity classified in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging.
The Private Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants, except that the Private Warrants will be exercisable for cash or on a net-share settlement basis, at the holder’s option, and be non-redeemable so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. If the Private Warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the Private Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants. In addition, so long as the Private Warrants are held by EarlyBirdCapital and its designee, the Private Warrants will expire 
five years
 from the effective date of the Merger.
The exercise price and number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the Warrants will not be adjusted for issuance of Common Stock at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the Warrants.
The Private Warrant liability was measured at fair value, resulting in (loss)/gain of $(
223
), $
59
 and $
979
 for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. This was classified within changes in fair value of warrant liability in the consolidated statements of operations.
The Private Warrants were valued using the following assumptions under the Monte Carlo Model that assumes optimal exercise of the Company’s redemption option at the earliest possible date:
December 31,
2024
Market price of public stock
$
2.07

Exercise price
$

Expected term (years)
1.57
Volatility
113.75

%
Risk-free interest rate
4.13

%
Dividend rate
0.00

%
The market price of public stock is the quoted market price of the Company’s Common Stock as of the valuation date. The exercise price is extracted from the warrant agreements. The expected term is derived from the exercisable years based on the warrant agreements. The expected volatility is a blend of implied volatility from the Company’s own public warrant pricing, the average volatility of peer companies and the Company's historical volatility. The risk-free interest rate was estimated based on the market yield of US Government Bond with maturity close to the expected term of the warrants. The dividend yield was estimated by the Company based on its expected dividend policy over the expected term of the warrants.
On May 28, 2024, the Company also issued a warrant exercisable for 
5,500,000
 shares of Common Stock at an initial exercise price of $
2.00
 per share. The Warrant expires on May 28, 2029 in connection of the convertible loan with shareholder. See Note 26 – Convertible loan with shareholder measured at fair value.

16. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT
Measured or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis
The Group measured its financial assets and liabilities, including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, warrant liability, convertible loan with shareholder at fair value on a recurring basis. Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued based on the quoted market price in an active market. The fair value of the warrant liability and convertible loan with shareholder are based on significant unobservable inputs, which represent Level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy. In determining the fair value of the warrant liability, the Company used the Monte Carlo Model that assumes optimal exercise of the Company’s redemption option at the earliest possible date. Refer to Note 26 for disclosure of valuation model utilized in measuring the fair value of convertible loan.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, information about inputs for the fair value measurements of the Group’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis in periods subsequent to their initial recognition is as follow:

As of December 31, 2024, the Group had $
359,290
 operating loss carried forward. The operating loss carried forward for the Company’s PRC subsidiaries amounted to $
219,668
, which will expire on various dates from 2025 to 2034. For the remaining operating loss, $
139,622
 will be carried forward indefinitely. The Group determined the valuation allowance on an entity by entity basis and assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize the existing deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance is primarily related to entities with net operating loss carry-forwards for which the Group does not believe it will ultimately be realized.
19. NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS
Non controlling interests of Microvast Inc.
On December 19, 2022, Microvast Inc. and a third party set up a company named Microvast Precision Works Co., Ltd ("MPW"). The Company holds a 
70
% shareholding in MPW and consolidates MPW, and the third party holds 
30
%. The total registered capital of MPW is $
7,246
 which the shareholders intended to fund pro-rata to their shareholding. As of December 31, 2022, no investment was paid by any of the parties and MPW had no operation. In 2023, the Company invested cash of $
5,072
 in MPW and fulfilled its funding obligation. The third party shareholder did not fully inject its funding as was required, and informed the Company that it would withdraw from MPW. As a result, Microvast Inc. became MPW's sole owner as of December 31, 2023. The amount of net loss attributable to non controlling interests was 
nil
, $
76
 and 
nil
 for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

21. SHARE-BASED PAYMENT
On July 21, 2021, the Company adopted the Microvast Holdings, Inc. 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”), effective upon the Closing Date. The 2021 Plan provides for the grant of incentive and non-qualified stock option, restricted stock units, restricted share awards, stock appreciation awards, and cash-based awards to employees, directors, and consultants of the Company. Options awarded under the 2021 Plan expire no more than 
10
 years from the date of grant. Concurrently with the closing of the Business Combination, the share awards granted under 2012 Share Incentive Plan of Microvast, Inc. (the “2012 Plan”) were rolled over by removing original performance conditions and converting into options and capped non-vested share units with modified vesting schedules, using the ratio of 
160.3
. The 2021 Plan reserved 
5
% of the fully-diluted shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately following the Closing Date plus the shares underlying awards rolled over from the 2012 Plan for issuance in accordance with the 2021 Plan’s terms. As of December 31, 2024, 
15,608,278
 shares of Common Stock was available for grant under the 2021 Plan.
Share options
On April 10, 2024, a termination and transition advisory services agreement was entered between a former employee and the Company. According to this agreement, all unvested restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stock units and stock options held by the employee as of April 10, 2024 will vest in full immediately following April 10, 2025. The Company accounted for the modification as a Type III (improbable-to-probable) modification, which represents the modification of the award that was not expected to vest under the original vesting conditions at the date of the modification. The Company recognized compensation cost equal to the modified award’s fair value at the date of the modification over the period in which the former employee serves as consultant to the Company.
The grant and modification date fair value of the stock options was determined using the Black Scholes model with the following assumptions:

The exercise prices for each award were extracted from the option agreements. The expected terms for each award were derived using the simplified method, and is estimated to occur at the midpoint of the vesting date and the expiration date. The volatility of the underlying common stock during the lives of the options was a blend of implied volatility from the average volatility of peer companies, implied volatility and the Company's historical volatility. Risk-free interest rate was estimated based on the market yield of US Government Bonds with maturity close to the expected term of the options. The dividend yield was estimated by the Company based on its expected dividend policy over the expected term of the options.

25,175
, $
51,289
 and $
60,020
 related to the option awards.
The total unrecognized equity-based compensation costs as of December 31, 2024 related to the stock options was $
2,001
, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 
1.7
 years. The aggregate intrinsic value of the share options as of December 31, 2024 was $
1,637
.
Capped Non-vested share units
The capped non-vested share units ("CRSUs") represent rights for the holder to receive cash determined by the number of shares granted multiplied by the lower of the fair market value and the capped price, which will be settled in the form of cash payments. The CRSUs were accounted for as liability classified awards. 
On June 27, 2022, the Board of Directors and Compensation Committee approved a modification of the settlement terms of 
20,023,699
 CRSUs under the 2021 Plan from cash settlement to share settlement (the “CRSU Modification”). Pursuant to the CRSU Modification, on each vesting date, if the stock price is higher than the capped price, the number of shares to be issued will be calculated based on the following formula: 
Number of shares to be issued = Capped price* Number of shares vested /Vesting date stock price
If the stock price is equal to or less than the capped price, the Company will grant a fixed number of shares on each vesting date based on the vesting schedule. All other terms of the CRSUs remain unchanged. The CRSU Modification resulted in a change of the CRSUs’ classification from liability to equity, as the predominant feature of the modified CRSUs was the granting of a fixed number of shares on each vesting date instead of a fixed monetary amount. The determination of the predominant feature was based on the estimated probability of how the awards will be settled using the Monte Carlo model.
At the CRSU Modification date, the Company reclassified the amounts previously recorded as a share-based compensation liability to additional paid-in capital. The modified CRSUs were accounted for as an equity award going forward from the date of the CRSU Modification with compensation expenses recognized for each tranche at the fair value measured on the modification date.

Risk-free interest rate was estimated based on the market yield of US Government Bonds with maturity close to the expected term of the awards. The dividend yield was estimated by the Company based on its expected dividend policy over the expected term of the awards.
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded share-based compensation expense of $

Restricted Stock Units
Following the Merger, the Company granted 
5,158,451
 restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and 
2,680,372
 performance-based restricted stock unit (“PSU”) awards subject to service, performance and/or market conditions. The service condition requires the participant’s continued services or employment with the Company through the applicable vesting date, and the performance condition requires the achievement of the performance criteria defined in the award agreement. The market condition is based on the Company’s TSR. For RSU awards with performance conditions, stock-based compensation expense is only recognized if the performance conditions become probable to be satisfied.
The fair value of RSUs is determined by the price of Common Stock at the grant date and is amortized over the vesting period on a straight-line basis. The fair value of PSU awards that include vesting based on market conditions are estimated using the Monte Carlo valuation method. Compensation cost for PSU awards is recognized based on the grant date fair value which is recognized over the vesting period on a straight-line basis. Accordingly, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $
1,850
, $
1,992
 and $

22. MAINLAND CHINA CONTRIBUTION PLAN
Full time employees of the Group in the PRC participate in a government-mandated multiemployer defined contribution plan pursuant to which certain pension benefits, medical care, unemployment insurance, employee housing fund and other welfare benefits are provided to employees. Chinese labor regulations require the Group to accrue for these benefits based on certain percentages of the employees’ salaries. The total provisions for such employee benefits were $
5,012
, $
3,552
 and $
3,370
 for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
23. STATUTORY RESERVES AND RESTRICTED NET ASSETS 
Relevant PRC statutory laws and regulations permit payments of dividends by the Group’s PRC subsidiaries only out of their retained earnings, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. The results of operations reflected in the financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP differ from those reflected in the statutory financial statements of the Company’s subsidiaries.
Because the Group’s entities in the PRC can only be paid out of distributable profits reported in accordance with PRC accounting standards, the Group’s entities in the PRC are restricted from transferring a portion of their net assets to the Company. In accordance with the Regulations on Enterprises with Foreign Investment of China and their articles of association, a foreign invested enterprise established in the PRC is required to provide certain statutory reserves, namely general reserve fund, the enterprise expansion fund and staff welfare and bonus fund which are appropriated from net profit as reported in the enterprise’s PRC statutory accounts, which is included in the retained earnings account in the equity section of the consolidated balance sheets. A wholly-owned foreign invested enterprise is required to allocate at least 
10
% of its annual after-tax profit to the general reserve until such reserve reaches 
50
% of its respective registered capital based on the enterprise’s PRC statutory accounts. Appropriations to the enterprise expansion fund and staff welfare and bonus fund are at the discretion of the board of directors for all foreign invested enterprises. The aforementioned reserves can only be used for specific purposes and are not distributable as cash dividends. If any PRC subsidiary incurs debt on its own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other payments to the Group. Any limitation on the ability of the PRC subsidiaries to distribute dividends or other payments to their respective shareholders could materially and adversely limit the ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to pay dividends.
The restricted amounts include the paid-in capital and statutory reserves of the Group’s entities in the PRC. The aggregate amount of paid-in capital and statutory reserves, which is the amount of net assets of the Group’s entities in the PRC (mainland) not available for distribution, were $
528,337
 and $
528,337
 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
24. SEGMENT INFORMATION 
Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise engaging in businesses activities for which separate financial information is available that is regularly evaluated by the Group’s chief operating decision makers (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. The Group’s CODM has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), who uses consolidated net loss to measure segment profit or loss, allocate resources, and assess performance. The CODM is regularly provided with the consolidated statements of operations and uses consolidated net loss to monitor budget versus actual results when making decisions about the allocation of operating and capital resources. As such, the Group concluded that it has 
one
 operating segment and 
one
 reporting segment.

9.75
% per annum. Of this margin,

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024, 2023 AND 2022
(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share data, or as otherwise noted)
On March 17, 2025, the Company entered into a First Amendment to the Loan Agreement (the “First Amendment”) with Mr. Yang Wu, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman. The First Amendment extends the maturity date from November 28, 2025 to May 28, 2026. All other terms and conditions of the Loan Agreement remain unchanged.
The Loan Agreement also grants Mr. Wu the right to convert the outstanding principal balance of the loan into shares of common stock at an initial conversion rate of 
two
 shares per $1.00 of principal amount converted.
The initial term loan of $
12,000
 was received in May 2024 and the delayed draw term loan of $
13,000
 was received in July 2024.
The loan is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of its assets by Microvast Inc. and all other entities within the Group as guarantors.
The Group has elected fair value option to account for the convertible loan. Direct costs and fees related to the convertible loan were expensed as incurred. Subsequent changes in the fair value are recorded as a gain/(loss) in the consolidated statement of operations. The outstanding balance for the Convertible loan with shareholder was $
104,613
 as of December 31, 2024. 
The significant input of the discounted cash flow model for the bond component is the discount rate. Below are the key inputs used in Black-Scholes-Merton model for the conversion option:

%
Risk-free interest rate

Dividend rate

%
The market price of public stock is the quoted market price of the Company’s Common Stock as of the valuation date. The exercise price is extracted from the warrant agreements. The expected term is derived from the exercisable years based on the warrant agreements. The expected volatility is estimated using a blend of the average volatility of peer companies and the Company's historical volatility. The risk-free interest rate was estimated based on the market yield of U.S. Government Bond with maturity close to the expected term of the warrants. The dividend yield was estimated by the Company based on its expected dividend policy over the expected term of the warrants.
In connection with the convertible loan from Mr. Wu, on May 28, 2024, the Company also issued to Mr. Wu a warrant exercisable for 
5,500,000
 shares of common stock at an initial exercise price of $
2.00
 per share. The warrant expires on May 28, 2029. No warrants were exercised for the year ended December 31, 2024. Since the warrant met the criteria of equity classification, the Group recorded the warrant in additional paid-in capital on the issuance date at $
779
, with no changes recognized subsequent to the issuance date. The initial carrying amounts of the warrant is determined by the difference between the total proceeds received and the fair value of the convertible loan.

28. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Litigation
Corporate Governance Actions
Stephen Vogel, Ruth Epstein, Stefan Selig, Richard Rieger, Amy Butte, Yang Wu and Yanzhuan Zheng have been named as defendants in a litigation filed in the Court of Chancery captioned 
Matt Jacob v. Stephen A. Vogel, et al., C.A. No. 2022-0600-PAF (
Del. Ch.) (filed July 07, 2022). The plaintiff is seeking to certify the litigation as a stockholder class action.  The complaint alleges that Stephen Vogel, Ruth Epstein, Stefan Selig, Richard Rieger and Amy Butte breached their fiduciary duties in connection with Tuscan's acquisition of Microvast, Inc., including by making inadequate disclosures concerning the projected earnings of Microvast, Inc. The complaint further alleges that once the earnings of the combined company became public, the Company's stock dropped, causing losses to investors. The complaint also alleges that Yang Wu and Yanzhuan Zheng aided and abetted these purported breaches. Certain defendants have answered the complaint, and certain defendants have filed motions to dismiss, which will be argued on April 03, 2025.
On December 13, 2023, in response to a stockholder litigation demand, the Company filed a petition in the Court of Chancery pursuant
 to Section 205 of the Delaware General Corporation Law seeking validation of an amendment to the Company’s Amended Certificate of Incorporation, the Business Combination and the issuance of the shares issued pursuant thereto, and the Company’s Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation adopted in connection with the Business Combination (collectively, the "Acts") to resolve any uncertainty with respect to those matters, which action was captioned 
In re Microvast Holdings Inc
., C.A. No. 2023-1245-PAF. On March 18, 2024, the Court of Chancery granted the petition, validating and declaring effective each Act as of the time and date such Act was originally taken.

The Company, the directors of Company predecessor, Tuscan, and certain former and current Company officers and directors have also been named as defendants in a litigation filed in the Court of Chancery captioned 
Denish Bhavsar v. Stephen Vogel, et al.
, Case No. 2024-0137-PAF (Del. Ch.) (filed Feb. 14, 2024). The plaintiff purports to assert derivative claims on behalf of the Company.  The complaint alleges among other things that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with Tuscan’s acquisition of Microvast, Inc., including by making inadequate disclosures concerning Microvast, Inc.’s earnings and alleged conflicts of interest that existed between certain directors and Company stockholders.  
The Company, certain former and current Company officers and directors have also been named as defendants in a litigation filed in the Court of Chancery captioned 
Henry Park v. Yang Wu, et al.
, C.A. No. 2024-0868-PAF (Del. Ch.) (filed August 19, 2024).  The plaintiff purports to assert derivative claims on behalf of the Company. The complaint alleges that certain individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with Tuscan’s acquisition of Microvast, Inc., including by making inadequate disclosures concerning Microvast, Inc.’s earnings and by refusing to investigate a litigation demand. On October 14, 2024, the Company and other defendants filed a motion to dismiss but the judge has not yet ruled on the motion.
The Company has received additional demands from purported Company stockholders, requesting that the Company's Board of Directors investigate whether current and former directors and officers of the Company and its predecessors, Tuscan and Microvast, Inc., breached their fiduciary duties by allegedly making material misrepresentations about 
inter alia
 (1) Microvast Inc.'s performance and financial health in connection with the merger between Tuscan and Microvast Inc., and (2) the Company's loss of a conditional grant from the United States Department of Energy. The Company has reviewed and responded to a certain of the demands and is evaluating responses to others. The Company has also received, reviewed and responded to a stockholder demand for books and records made pursuant to Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law that purportedly seeks to investigate the loss of the DOE grant.
Securities Litigation
The Company and certain of its officers have also been named as defendants in a putative class action complaint by a shareholder of the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas under the caption 
Schelling v. Microvast Holdings, Inc., 
Case No. 4:23-cv-04565 (S.D. Tex.) (filed Dec. 5, 2023) (the "Schelling Action"). The complaint alleges that defendants violated certain federal securities laws by making misleading statements regarding the receipt of a conditional grant from the United States Department of Energy, the Company’s profitability, and the nature of Company-associated operations in China. On March 1, 2024, the court appointed Co-Lead Plaintiffs and Co-Lead Counsel for the proposed class of Company investors.  Plaintiffs amended their complaint on May 13, 2024, and defendants filed a motion to dismiss on June 20, 2024.  Briefing on the motion to dismiss was completed on September 10, 2024. The Court has not ruled yet on the motion.
The Company and certain of its officers and directors have also been named as defendants in 
three
 derivative actions filed in the Southern District of Texas under the captions 
Bhavsar v. Wu et al.
, No. 4:24-cv-00372 (S.D. Tex.) (filed Jan. 31, 2024), 
Marti et al v. Wu et al
, Case No. 4:24-cv-00633 (S.D. Tex.) (filed Feb. 23, 2024), 
Gidaro v. Wu et al
, Case No. 4:24-cv-00828 (S.D. Tex.) (filed Mar. 6, 2024). The complaints allege that the officer and director defendants violated the federal securities laws by making inadequate disclosures substantially similar to those alleged in the 
Schelling 
Action. The complaints further allege that these inadequate disclosures resulted from, and constituted, breaches of the officer and director defendants’ fiduciary duties. On February 24, 2024, the court entered in an order in the first-filed case, 
Bhavsar v. Wu
 et al., No. 4:24-cv-00372, consolidating the 
Bhavsar
 case and 
Marti et al v. Wu et al
, Case No. 4:24-cv-00633.  The consolidated derivative litigation (the “Consolidated Derivative Action”) is captioned 
In re Microvast Holdings, Inc. Derivative Litigation
, Lead Case No. 4:24-cv-00372 (S.D. Tex.). The parties in the 
Gidardo
 action filed a stipulation to consolidate the 
Gidaro
 case into the Consolidated Derivative Action. The Consolidated Derivative Action is stayed pending disposition of an anticipated motion to dismiss in the 
Schelling 
Action.

28. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES - continued
Litigation - continued
Securities Litigation - continued
Pursuant to the Company's governing documents and indemnification agreements entered into by the Company with certain of the named defendants, in the above-described actions, the Company has indemnified those defendants for all expenses and losses related to the litigation subject to the terms of those indemnification agreements. While the lawsuits are being vigorously defended, other reported lawsuits of this type have resulted in a broad range of outcomes, with each case being dependent on its own unique set of facts and circumstances. Litigation of this kind can lead to settlement negotiations, including negotiations prompted by pre-trial civil court procedures. The outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain, and there is always the possibility that a court rules in a manner that is adverse to the interests of the Company and the individual defendants. However, the amount of any such loss in that scenario, which could be material, cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.  
Other Matters
The Company and Microvast Energy, Inc. (“MV Energy”), a subsidiary of the Company, have been named as defendants in a litigation filed in the Montgomery County Chancery Court for the State of Tennessee under the caption 
Stoncor Group, Inc. v. Microvast, Inc., et al
, Case No. CD-24-12 (Tenn. Ch.) (filed Mar. 18, 2024). The plaintiff alleges that the Company failed to pay it for construction work that it performed on a Microvast facility in Tennessee, and seeks damages of $
1,251
, plus certain fees and expenses, and foreclosure on the facility to satisfy the payment allegedly owed. The parties have entered into a settlement agreement and this matter has been stayed by the order of the court. 
Deidra Milan is an ex-employee of Microvast, and is the putative representative of a class of more than 100 individual employees who were let go from their jobs at a plant in Clarksville, Tennessee. She has filed

. in the US District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. The Company filed an answer to the suit on July 19, 2024. The Class Action Complaint is brought under the Worker Adjustment and Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. §§2101-2109 (the “WARN Act”), which requires advance notice before certain types of plant closings and mass layoffs. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants failed to give proper advance notice of a mass layoff in violation of the WARN Act.

19,950
 in progress billings, the additional sum of $
1,566
 being held as retainage on Plaintiff's progress billings under the contract, lost profits on the work yet to be performed under the contract plus certain fees and expenses, and foreclosure on the facility to satisfy the payment allegedly owed. The Parties entered into a settlement agreement and this matter has been stayed by order of the court.

Microvast, Inc. has initiated lawsuit as a plaintiff in an action filed in the 11th Judicial District Court, Harris County, Texas under the caption 
Microvast, Inc. v. Grupo Basan Barba Santana, S.A. De C.V., Cause No. 2025-11326 (
filed on February 19, 2025
). 
Microvast ordered and paid energy storage systems from Grupo Basan. Microvast ended the supply contract and under the supply contract, Microvast was entitled to the return of a large portion of the $
3.5
 million deposit Microvast had paid Grupo Basan as well as compensation for a significant number of products that it never received. However, Grupo Basan not only has failed to return those funds, but Grupo Basan has itself demanded $
2.4
 million in million in termination costs that are not provided for in the supply agreement. Microvast recently filed suit in Harris County, Texas seeking at least $
2.6
 million plus fees and interest. 
On November 14, 2024, Microvast Energy, Inc. was named as a defendant in breach of contract action filed before the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under the caption 
Clenera Battery Holdco LLC v. Microvast, Inc.., Case No. 01-24-0008-7288. 
Clenera's breach of contract claim centers on a supply agreement between Microvast and Clenera for custom-made battery containers. Clenera alleges that Microvast must refund approximately 
$
36
 million

due to Microvast's failure to deliver the containers by the contractual deadline, per the terms of the supply agreement. Clenera also seeks interest and attorneys’ fees. The parties have appointed their arbitrators and a chair has been selected. On November 15, 2024, Clenera had filed an action for the same claim against Microvast Holdings, Inc. in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, under the caption 
Clenera Battery Holdco LLC v. Microvast Holdings, Inc.
, Index No. 659103/2024. Microvast Holdings, Inc. was the guarantor for the supply agreement between Clenera and Microvast Energy. Clenera's allegations are identical to its arbitration claim against Microvast Energy. Clenera has agreed to consolidate this action into the AAA arbitration. This consolidation is under review by the AAA panel. 
The Group is also involved in other litigation, claims, and proceedings. The Group evaluates the status of each legal matter and assesses the potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any legal proceedings or litigation is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the Group accrues a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required to determine the probability of a loss and whether the amount of the loss is reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, based on the information currently available, the Group believes that any loss contingencies that may arise as a result of currently pending legal proceedings cannot be accurately quantified at this time and thus cannot determine whether they will have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. 
Capital commitments

None.
ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Under supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2024, as a result of the material weakness identified below. 
In light of this material weakness, we performed additional analysis as deemed necessary to ensure that our financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Based on such analysis and notwithstanding the identified material weakness, management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believe the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report fairly represent in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows at and for the periods presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. As a result of this assessment, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective due to the material weakness described below.
Material Weakness
As defined in the standards established by the PCAOB, a “material weakness” is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
In connection with the audit of the financial year ended December 31, 2024, we identified control deficiencies in the design and operation of internal controls over financial reporting that constituted a material weakness in aggregation. Significant improvement in the design and monitoring of information technology general controls (“GITC”) was made in 2024, however a material weakness has been identified relating to the design, implementation and monitoring of GITC for the ERP system that are relevant to the preparation of our financial statements. In particular, the Company’s GITC findings included: (i) inappropriate implementation of controls allowed developers to gain access to application layer of ERP; (ii) the monitoring controls were not appropriately designed to review the overall operations of the privileged users; (iii) the monitoring controls were not appropriately designed to review the permissions granted to users. A substantial portion of the Company's controls are dependent upon the information derived from the ERP system and therefore the dependent controls were also concluded to be ineffective. 
Material Weakness Remediation
Subsequent to the identification of the material weakness, we have taken steps to address the control deficiencies and continue to implement our remediation plan, which we believe addresses the underlying causes. We executed on our remediation plan for the material weakness by:
76
Table of Content
•
Removing all inappropriate access as of December 31, 2024, and strictly following segregation of duty rule set for developers.
•
Establishing more robust and precise processes to monitor the privileged user activities.
•
Establishing more robust and precise processes for the user access review.
While we believe these efforts will continue to improve our internal controls and address the underlying causes of the material weakness, the material weakness will not be remediated until our remediation plan has been fully implemented and tested and we have concluded that following the improvements, our IT general controls are operating effectively for a sufficient period of time.
Other Control Deficiencies Evaluated During the Year
During the impairment assessment process for plant, property and equipment as of  December 31, 2024, management identified a material misstatement in the previously issued financial statements for the second and third quarter of 2024. It is related to the impairment assessment of the Clarksville facility. Specifically, certain assets primarily including clean rooms were inadvertently excluded from the calculation of carrying value of the asset group used in the impairment test for the second quarter of 2024, leading to a $23.1 million understatement of the impairment charge, resulting in the need to restate the Company’s interim financial statements. 
The Company is required to become SOX compliant as of  December 31, 2024 for the first year and was in process during the year to design and implement appropriate internal controls. While this misstatement was not prevented or detected by internal controls during interim , the Company has implemented controls during the year-end closing to strengthen the impairment assessment process including 1) conducting a precise review of the calculation of carrying value of assets group; and 2) reconciling the individual assets included in the assets group carrying value calculation to the valuation scope of external valuers. By implementing those controls for purpose of the impairment assessment as of December 31, 2024, the Company was able to detect this issue and then proactively investigated the discrepancy and corrected the misstatement by restating the affected interim financial statements.

While this control deficiency was material to the interim periods, management concluded it did not constitute a material weakness as of  December 31, 2024, because appropriate controls have been effectively implemented during the year end to detect the misstatement therefore the deficiency was fully remediated for the year ended  December 31, 2024. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting was therefore effective at year-end, except for the GITC-related material weakness noted above.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
As described above, the Company is taking steps to remediate the material weakness noted above. Other than in connection with these remediation steps, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believe that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable levels of assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors or all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Microvast Holdings, Inc. 
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Microvast Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described below on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets, and related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, changes in shareholders’ equity, cash flows and financial statement schedule(the “financial statements”) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated March 31, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Material Weakness
A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following unremediated

material weakness has been identified and included in management's assessment: the material weakness related to management’s failure to design, implement and monitor the information technology general controls for ERP system that relevant to preparation of the financial statements. Consequently, business process controls that rely upon information from the ERP system were also deemed ineffective. This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests

(3)    2023 non-equity incentive plan compensation was earned pursuant to the Company’s short-term cash incentive program. On January 31, 2023, the Compensation Committee of the Board established short-term cash incentive opportunities for our NEOs for 2023, which pay out in cash as a percentage of each NEO’s base salary based on achievement of pre-determined revenue and adjusted gross margin performance goals, each weighted equally. The Compensation Committee set the following bonus target for Mr. Wu the only current NEO who was an NEO only for 2023: 30% of base salary ($165,000). 
Elements of Executive Compensation
Base Salary
Base salaries are intended to provide a level of compensation sufficient to attract and retain an effective management team when considered in combination with the other components of our executive compensation program. 
84
Table of Content
The relative levels of base salary for our NEOs are designed to reflect each NEO’s scope of responsibility and accountability to us. The base salaries for each of our NEOs were increased effective December 1, 2024: 
•
Mr. Yang Wu: Increased from $550,000 to $564,480
•
Dr. Shengxian Wu: Increased from $200,000 to $400,000
•
Ms. Isida Tushe: Increased from $250,000 to $450,000
Short-Term Incentives
In 2023, the Compensation Committee of the Board established short-term cash incentive opportunities, which pay out in cash as a percentage of each executive's base salary based on achievement of pre-determined revenue and adjusted gross margin performance goals, each weighted equally. 
Short-term incentives pay out 0% of target if the threshold performance goal or below is achieved and 120% of target if the maximum performance goal or above is achieved. Payouts are linearly interpolated for performance between levels. While the revenue component failed to achieve threshold performance, the adjusted gross margin component was achieved at maximum performance and each executive who remained at the Company through the end of 2023 received a payout of 60% of his or her short-term incentive target.
In 2024, with the Company experiencing volatility making it difficult to set goals, the Compensation Committee chose not to establish a formal short-term cash incentive program. Instead, the Compensation Committee granted one-time cash bonuses in the amounts of $125,000 and $93,750 to Ms. Tushe and Dr. Wu, respectively. 
Long-Term Incentives
On December 1, 2024, the Compensation Committee approved 2024 long-term incentive awards (the “2024 LTI”) to the NEOs pursuant to the 2021 Plan. Mr. Wu, our CEO, received 500,000 RSUs, that were fully vested at grant. Ms. Tushe and Dr. Wu each received a grant of stock options to purchase 1,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price per share of $1.29. The stock options will vest in equal installments on each November 8, 2025, 2026, and 2027, subject to continued employment on each vesting date. 
Mr. Wu received PSUs in 2022, which will vest, if at all, based on the Company’s achievement of relative total stockholder return (“TSR”) targets during the performance period from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024, provided that the recipient continues to provide services to the Company through the date achievement is certified by the Compensation Committee. The Committee reviewed the Company’s relative TSR and determined that the 2022 PSUs were earned at 60% of target.

Insider Trading Policy and Anti-Hedging and Anti-Pledging
The Company has an insider trading policy which governs the purchase, sale and other dispositions of its securities by directors, officers, employees and other agents of the Company, as well as their immediate family members and other persons living in their households.
 We believe our insider trading policy is reasonably designed to promote compliance with insider trading laws, rules and regulations and any listing standards applicable to the Company. The insider trading policy prohibits covered persons from directly or indirectly purchasing or selling the Company’s securities while in possession of material non-public information concerning the Company, except in the limited circumstances described in the policy. Additionally, the Company’s directors, officers and employees are prohibited from engaging in hedging and pledging transactions with respect to the Company’s securities of the Company. The insider trading policy requires pre-approval of any transaction related to the Company’s securities by the Company’s directors, officers, certain employees and agents.

Compensation Recovery Policy
We have adopted a compensation recovery policy in accordance with the listing standards and rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market, that requires the Board to recoup excess compensation paid to our executive officers as a result of a financial statement restatement, regardless of any misconduct, fault or illegal activity on the part of the executive officer. The clawback policy applies in the case of an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws. The clawback policy applies to all incentive-based compensation, which is any compensation that is granted, earned, or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a financial reporting measure, received by our executive officers.
Equity Award Policies and Practices
Although we have not adopted a formal policy pertaining to the timing of stock option grants to our named executive officers, it is our practice not to time the grant of equity awards, including stock options, in relation to the release of material non-public information.

Similarly, the Company 
does not time
 the disclosure of 
material nonpublic information
 for the purpose of affecting the value of executive compensation.
 The Compensation Committee generally approves the grant of annual equity awards for the Company’s executive officers, including each of the named executive officers, in 
December of each year.
 In special circumstances, including the hiring or promotion of an individual or where the Compensation Committee determines it is in the best interest of the Company, the Compensation Committee may approve grants of equity awards at other times.

Employment Agreements with NEOs
Mr. Wu is a party to a written employment arrangement with the Company (the “Employment Agreement”). The material terms of that arrangement are summarized below. For a description of the compensation actually paid to the NEOs for Fiscal Year 2024, please refer to the “Summary Compensation Table” above. Dr. Wu and Ms. Tushe are not parties to an employment agreement. 
Subject to earlier termination in accordance with the Employment Agreement, Mr. Wu is engaged for a three-year term of employment, at the end of which his term of employment will be automatically extended for additional 12-month periods unless a notice of non-renewal is given by either party in accordance with the notice requirements of the Employment Agreement prior to the expiration of the term then in effect.
The Employment Agreement provides for an annual base salary, the opportunity to participate in the Company’s annual incentive bonus plan for senior executives and the Company’s long-term incentive plan, each in accordance with the terms of such plans that may be in effect from time-to-time and subject to such other terms as the Board may approve and eligibility to participate in the benefit plans or programs of the Company generally provided to other similarly situated executives of the Company.
The term of employment under the Employment Agreement may be terminated by either the Company or Mr. Wu at any time and for any reason upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice. Upon a termination by the Company or Mr. Wu for any reason, Mr. Wu (or his estate upon a termination due to his death) will receive all accrued salary and any earned but unpaid bonuses through and including the date of termination. Following a termination due to death or disability of Mr. Wu, he (or his estate) will also receive: (i) a pro rata bonus for the annual bonus that he would have earned for the fiscal year in which the death or disability occurs based on performance as determined by the Board, prorated for the period of time during the fiscal year worked by Mr. Wu; and (ii) if the death or disability occurs within his three-year term, full acceleration of any equity awards or other long-term incentive awards held by Mr. Wu as of the effective time of his Employment Agreement that were granted to Mr. Wu prior to such effective time. Any other outstanding equity awards or long-term incentive awards granted to Mr. Wu following the effective time of his Employment Agreement will be treated in accordance with the terms of the applicable plans and award agreements.
Following a termination of employment by the Company without Cause (as defined in the Employment Agreement) or due to resignation by Mr. Wu for Good Reason (as defined in the Employment Agreement), in either case, prior to a Change in Control (as defined in the Employment Agreement), subject to the execution and non-revocation by Mr. Wu of a general release of claims in favor of the Company, Mr. Wu will be entitled to: (i) an amount equal to two and a half times the sum of (x) Mr. Wu’s then-current base salary plus (y) the greater of (A) the average amount of the annual bonus paid to Mr. Wu for each of the three fiscal years immediately prior to the fiscal year in which the termination or resignation occurs or (B) the target annual bonus for the fiscal year in which the termination or resignation occurs, payable in substantially equal monthly installments over a period of thirty (30) months; and (ii) if the termination without Cause or resignation for Good Reason occurs within three years following the effective time of his Employment Agreement, full acceleration of any equity awards or other long-term incentive awards held by Mr. Wu as of the effective time of his

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 
Stockholders Agreement
In connection with the Business Combination, on July 23, 2021, the Company, Mr. Yang Wu and Tuscan Holdings Acquisition LLC entered into an agreement (the “Stockholders Agreement”) which provides that Mr. Wu will have the right, but not the obligation, to nominate for election to the Board at every meeting of the stockholders of the Company at which directors are elected a number of individuals (rounded up to the nearest whole number) equal to (a) the total number of directors, multiplied by (b) the quotient obtained by dividing the shares of common stock beneficially owned by Mr. Wu by the total number of outstanding shares of common stock (each, a “Wu Director”) less the number of Wu Directors then serving on the Board and whose terms in office are not expiring at such meeting. Yang Wu, Yanzhuan Zheng, Stanley Whittingham and Arthur Wong were nominated by Yang Wu as the initial Wu Directors. The Stockholders Agreement provides that any increase or decrease in the number of directors will require the affirmative vote of the Wu Directors. Under the terms of the Stockholders Agreement, there are currently four Wu Directors. 
The Stockholders Agreement also provides that, so long as Tuscan Holdings Acquisition LLC beneficially owns at least 5,175,000 shares of common stock, Tuscan Holdings Acquisition LLC will have the right, but not the obligation, to nominate for election to the Board at every meeting of the stockholders of the Company at which directors are elected, one individual (the “Tuscan Director”) less the number of Tuscan Directors then serving on the Board and whose terms in office are not expiring at such meeting. Stephen Vogel was nominated by Tuscan Holdings Acquisition LLC as the initial Tuscan Director. Since Tuscan Holdings Acquisition LLC no longer beneficially owns 5,175,000 shares of common stock, Tuscan Holdings Acquisition LLC no longer has the right to nominate a Tuscan Director.
Registration Rights and Lock-Up Agreement
On July 23, 2021, the Company entered into the Registration Rights and Lockup Agreement with stockholders of Microvast, Inc. prior to the consummation of the Business Combination, the affiliates of certain former investors in our subsidiary MPS, the Tuscan Group and certain officers and directors of the Company, pursuant to which the Company was obligated to file a registration statement promptly following the closing of the Business Combination to register the resale of certain securities of the Company held by the parties to the Registration Rights and Lock-Up Agreement. The Registration Rights and Lock-Up Agreement provides the parties thereto with “piggy-back” registration rights, subject to certain requirements and customary conditions.
Subject to certain exceptions, the Registration Rights and Lock-Up Agreement further provides (1) Mr. Wu will be subject to a lock-up of two years for 75% of his shares of common stock, provided that, with respect to the 25% of his shares subject to the one-year lock-up, he can sell those shares if the shares trade at $15.00 or above for 20 days in any 30-day period, and (2) with respect to the shares of common stock owned by members of the Tuscan Group, certain officers and officers of the Company and the Tuscan Group such shares are subject to the transfer restrictions provided in the Amendment to the Escrow Agreement (as defined below).
Indemnity Agreements
On July 23, 2021, we entered into indemnity agreements with Mr. Wu, Yanzhuan Zheng, Craig Webster, Wei Ying, Stanley Whittingham, Arthur Wong and Stephen Vogel, each of whom became a director following the Business Combination, and Wenjuan Mattis, Ph.D., Shane Smith, Shengxian Wu, and Sascha Rene Kelterborn, each of whom became an executive officer of the Company following the Business Combination. Each indemnity agreement provides that, subject to limited exceptions, we will indemnify the director or executive officer to the fullest extent permitted by law for claims arising in his or her capacity as our director or officer.  On April 18, 2024, we entered into an indemnity agreement with Isida Tushe and on October 18, 2024, we entered into an indemnity agreement with Yixin Pan.
Parent Support Agreement
In connection with the Business Combination, Tuscan and certain related parties entered into an amendment to the Escrow Agreement between Tuscan, the Company, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company and the Tuscan Group (“Escrow Agreement”) pursuant to which 6,750,000 shares held by Tuscan Holdings Acquisition LLC, and the 30,000 
94
Table of Content
shares held by each of Stefan M. Selig, Richard O. Rieger and Amy Butte (together with Tuscan Holdings Acquisition LLC, the “Founders”) are being held post-Business Combination. Pursuant to the amended Escrow Agreement:
•
The Escrow Agent will hold 843,750 shares of common stock held by Tuscan Holdings Acquisition LLC until the date on which the last sale price of our common stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period following the closing of the Business Combination (the “First Earn-Out Target”).
•
The Escrow Agent will hold an additional 843,750 shares of common stock held by Tuscan Holdings Acquisition LLC until the date on which the last sale price of our common stock equals or exceeds $15.00 per share for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period following the closing of the Business Combination (the “Second Earn-Out Target”).
•
If neither the First Earn-Out Target nor the Second Earn-Out Target is satisfied on or prior to the fifth anniversary of the closing of the Business Combination, then the Escrow Agent will release all the shares held in escrow to the Company for cancellation for no consideration. If only the First Earn-Out Target has been satisfied on or prior to the fifth anniversary of the closing of the Business Combination, then the Escrow Agent will release 834,750 shares of common stock to the Company for cancellation for no consideration.
Independence of Directors
Under the listing rules of the Nasdaq Capital Market, we are required to have a majority of independent directors serving on our Board. Our Board has determined that three of our five directors, namely, Yixin Pan, Wei Ying, and Arthur Wong are independent within the meaning of NASDAQ Rule 5605(a)(2).
Policy Regarding Related Party Transactions
We have adopted a written policy on transactions with “related persons,” defined in the policy as a director, executive officer, nominee for director, or greater than 5% beneficial owner of any class of the Company’s voting securities, and their immediate family members. For purposes of this policy, a “related person transaction” is defined as any transaction, arrangement or relationship in which the Company is a participant, the aggregate amount involved exceeds or may be expected to exceed $120,000 and in which a related person had, has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. The Board, acting through those members of the Audit Committee who are not interested in the transaction in question, will review related person transactions to determine whether the related person transaction is in, or is not inconsistent with, the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. If, after any such review, a related person transaction is determined to be in, or not inconsistent with, the best interests of the Company, then the related person transaction may be approved or ratified according to the procedures in the policy. If advance Audit Committee approval of a related person transaction requiring the Audit Committee’s approval is not practicable or desirable, then the chair of the Audit Committee may approve or ratify a related person transaction. In addition, the policy provides standing pre-approval for certain types of transactions that the Audit Committee has reviewed and determined will be deemed pre-approved.
