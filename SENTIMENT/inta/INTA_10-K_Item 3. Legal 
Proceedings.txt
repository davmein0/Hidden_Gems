Overview

We are a leading global provider of AI-powered solutions for the world’s premier accounting, consulting, investment banking, legal, private capital and real assets firms. Our vertical software as a service (“SaaS”) solutions help professionals apply their collective expertise to make smarter decisions, manage risk, increase competitive advantage and drive new growth. Using the power of Applied AI, our purpose-built vertical SaaS solutions help firms accelerate the flow of information, activate expertise, empower teams, strengthen client relationships, reduce risk, and adapt more quickly in a highly complex ecosystem. The world’s top firms — across accounting, consulting, investment banking, legal, private capital, and real assets — trust Intapp’s industry-specific platform and solutions to modernize and drive new growth.
Highlights for the Fiscal Year 2025
During fiscal year 2025, we generated total revenues of $504.1 million with a gross margin of 74%. Our operating cash flow was $123.5 million and

we completed the acquisition of TermSheet, LLC. Total cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2025 was $313.1 million. Our remaining performance obligations, which represent all future revenue under contract yet to be recognized, were $719.7 million as of June 30, 2025.
How We Generate Revenue
We generate revenues primarily from software subscriptions, typically with one-year or multi-year contract terms. We sell our software through a direct sales model, which targets clients based on end market, geography, firm size, and business need. We recognize revenues from SaaS and support revenue ratably over the contract term. We recognize license revenues related to subscription fees upfront and license revenues related to support ratably over the term of the support contract. We generally price our subscriptions based on the number of users adopting our solution and the modules deployed.
We expect the vast majority of our new ARR (as defined below) growth in the future to be from the sale of SaaS subscriptions.

We generate service revenues primarily from professional services. Our clients utilize these services to configure and implement one or more modules of the Intapp Intelligent Cloud, integrate those modules with the existing platform and with other core systems in their IT environment, upgrade their existing deployment, and provide training for their employees. Other professional services include strategic consulting and advisory work, which are generally provided on a standalone basis.

Key Factors Affecting Our Performance

Market Adoption of our Cloud Platform.
 Our future growth depends on our ability to win new accounting, consulting, investment banking, legal, private capital and real assets clients and expand within our existing client base, primarily through the continued acceptance of our cloud business. Our cloud business has historically grown faster than our overall business and represents an increasing proportion of our annual recurring revenues. We must demonstrate to new and existing clients the benefits of selecting our cloud platform, and support those deployments once live with reliable and secure service. From a sales perspective, our ability to add new clients and expand within existing accounts depends upon a number of factors, including the quality and effectiveness of our sales personnel and marketing efforts, and our ability to convince key decision makers within accounting, consulting, investment banking, legal, private capital and real assets firms to embrace the Intapp Intelligent Cloud over point solutions, internally developed solutions, and horizontal solutions. If our clients do not continue to see the ability of our platform to generate return on investment relative to other software alternatives, net revenue retention could suffer and our operating results may be adversely affected.

Continued Investment in Innovation and Growth. 
We have made substantial investments in research and development and sales and marketing to achieve a leadership position in our market and grow our revenues and client base. We intend to continue to invest in research and development to build new capabilities and maintain the core technology underpinning our differentiated platform. In addition, we expect to invest in sales and marketing to broaden our reach with new clients in the U.S. and abroad and deepen our penetration with existing clients. With our revenue growth objectives, we expect to continue to make such investments for the foreseeable future. We intend to continue to gradually increase our general and administrative spending to support our growing operational needs.

We have a track record of successfully identifying, acquiring and integrating complementary businesses within the accounting, consulting, investment banking, legal, private capital and real assets industries. To complement our organic investment in innovation and accelerate our growth, we will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities that help us extend our platform, broaden and deepen our market leadership, and add new clients.

Key Business Metrics

We review a number of operating and financial metrics, including the following key metrics to help us evaluate our business, measure our performance and the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and budgets, and make strategic decisions.

Annual Recurring Revenues (“ARR”)
ARR represents the annualized recurring value of all active SaaS and on-premise license contracts at the end of a reporting period. Contracts with a term other than one year are annualized by taking the committed contract value for the current period divided by number of days in that period then multiplying by 365. As a metric, ARR mitigates fluctuations in revenue recognition due to certain factors, including contract term and the sales mix of SaaS contracts and licenses. ARR does not have any standardized meaning and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. ARR should be viewed independently of revenues and deferred revenues and is not intended to be combined with or to replace either of those elements of our financial statements. ARR is not a forecast and the active contracts at the end of a reporting period used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our clients.

ARR was $485.4 million and $404.2 million as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, an increase of 20%.

Cloud ARR

Cloud ARR is the portion of our ARR which represents the annualized recurring value of our active SaaS contracts. We believe Cloud ARR provides important information about our ability to sell new SaaS subscriptions to existing clients and to acquire new SaaS clients.

Cloud ARR was $383.1 million and $296.7 million as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, an increase of 29%, and represented 79% and 73% of ARR for fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively.

47

Table of Contents

Cloud Net Revenue Retention (“NRR”)
Cloud NRR is the portion of our NRR which represents the net revenue retention of our SaaS contracts. We calculate Cloud NRR by starting with the Cloud ARR from the cohort of all clients as of the twelve months prior to the applicable fiscal period, or prior period Cloud ARR. We then calculate the Cloud ARR from these same clients as of the current fiscal period, or current period Cloud ARR. We then divide the current period Cloud ARR by the prior period Cloud ARR to calculate the Cloud NRR.

This metric accounts for changes in our cloud recurring revenue base from cross-sell (additional solution capabilities sold), upsell (additional seats sold), cloud migrations, price changes, and client attrition (including contraction of solution capabilities, contraction of seats and client churn). Our trailing twelve months Cloud NRR as of June 30, 2025 was 120%.

Number of Clients

We believe our ability to increase the number of clients on our platform is a key indicator of the growth of our business and our future business opportunities. We define a client at the end of any reporting period as an entity with at least one active subscription as of the measurement date. As of June 30, 2025, we had over 2,700 clients. No single client represented more than 10% of total revenues for fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Our client base includes some of the largest and most reputable accounting, consulting, investment banking, legal, private capital and real assets firms globally. These clients have the financial and operating resources needed to purchase, deploy, and successfully use the full capabilities of our software platform, and as such, we believe the number of our clients with contracts greater than $100,000 of ARR is an important metric for highlighting our progress on the path to full adoption of our platform by our accounting, consulting, investment banking, legal, private capital and real assets clients. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, we had 795 and 698 clients, respectively, with contracts greater than $100,000 of ARR, of which 109

and 73 clients, respectively, had contracts greater than $1.0 million of ARR.

With our scalable, modular cloud-based platform, we believe we are well positioned to continue our growth. Our most significant opportunity lies with the largest firms, where we see substantial expansion potential as firms continue to consolidate. We pursue growth in the number of clients, but our biggest drivers are the assets under management and revenue growth of our clients as well as growth in the total number of professionals they employ.
Components of Our Results of Operations

Certain prior period amounts reported have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Effective July 1, 2024, we adjusted the classification of support services related to subscription license to be included within “license” on the consolidated statements of operations. Prior to July 1, 2024, support services related to subscription license was included in a line item entitled “SaaS and Support.” The presentation of cost of revenues has been conformed to reflect the changes related to the presentation of revenues. Such reclassifications related to the presentation of revenues and cost of revenues effective as of July 1, 2024 and did not affect total revenues, operating income, or net income. There was no change to the revenue recognition policy, except for the change in classification noted herein. Refer to the Revenue Recognition section in Note 2. “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Revenues

We generate revenues from the sale of our SaaS solutions and premium support services related to SaaS, and subscriptions to our term software applications and support services related to licenses. We generate professional services revenues primarily by delivering professional services for the configuration, implementation and upgrade of our solutions.

SaaS

SaaS revenues include subscription fees from clients accessing our SaaS solutions, premium support services related to SaaS, and updates, if any, to the subscribed service during the subscription term. We recognize SaaS revenues ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract, which is the date when the service is provisioned and made available to our clients. The initial term of our SaaS contracts is generally one to three years in duration.

48

Table of Contents

License

License revenues include subscription fees from providing clients with the right to functional intellectual property where clients can benefit from the subscription licenses on their own and support services related to the licenses, which entitles clients to receive technical support and software updates, on a when and if available basis. We recognize license revenues related to subscription fees at a point in time when control of our term software application is transferred to the client, which generally occurs at the time of delivery or upon commencement of the renewal term. License fees are generally payable in advance on an annual basis over the term of the license arrangement, which is typically non-cancelable. We recognize license revenues related to support ratably over the term of the support contract which corresponds to the underlying license agreement. We expect to continue to generate a relatively consistent stream of license revenues from our existing license clients. However, over time as we focus on new sales of our SaaS solutions and encourage existing license clients to migrate to SaaS solutions, we expect revenues from license to decrease as a percentage of total revenues.
Professional Services

Our professional services primarily consist of implementation, configuration and upgrade services provided to clients and others. These engagements are billed to clients either on a time and materials or milestone basis; revenues are recognized as invoiced or in proportion to the work performed, respectively. We expect the demand for our professional services to remain relatively flat, with modest increases due to client growth and the need for implementation, upgrade, and migration services for new and existing clients. This demand will be affected by the mix of professional services that are provided by us versus provided by our third-party implementation partners, reflecting our strategy to de-emphasize professional services revenue. This shift will enhance partner involvement, support co-selling efforts, and drive partner-led deal origination.
Cost of Revenues

Our cost of revenues consists primarily of expenses related to providing SaaS solutions, premium support services related to SaaS, support services related to license and professional services to our clients, including personnel costs (salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation) and related expenses for client support and services personnel, as well as cloud infrastructure costs, third-party expenses, depreciation of fixed assets, amortization of capitalized internal-use software costs and acquired intangible assets, and allocated overhead costs. We expect our cost of revenues to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our SaaS client base over time as this will result in increased cloud infrastructure costs and increased costs for additional personnel to provide technical support services to our growing client base.

Cost of SaaS
Our cost of SaaS revenues comprises the direct costs to deliver and support our SaaS solutions and premium support services related to SaaS, including personnel costs, allocated overhead costs, third-party hosting fees related to cloud infrastructure, amortization of capitalized internal-use software costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and depreciation of fixed assets.
Cost of License

Our cost of license revenues comprises the direct costs to support our license, including personnel costs, and allocated overhead costs.
Cost of Professional Services

Our cost of professional services revenues comprises the personnel-related costs for our professional services employees and contractors responsible for delivering implementation, upgrade and migration services to our clients. This includes personnel costs and allocated overhead costs. We expect the cost of professional services revenues to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to hire personnel and engage contractors to provide implementation, upgrade and migration services to our growing client base.

Table of Contents

Operating Expenses

Research and Development

Our research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for engineering and product development employees, costs of third-party services, cloud infrastructure costs and allocated overhead costs. We expect our research and development expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we continue to dedicate substantial internal resources to develop, improve and expand the functionality of our solutions.
Sales and Marketing

Our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for personnel costs for our sales and marketing employees as well as sales commissions and benefits, costs of marketing events and online advertising, allocated overhead costs, and travel and entertainment expenses. We capitalize client acquisition costs (principally commissions paid to sales personnel) and subsequently amortize these costs over the expected period of benefits. In the medium term, we expect to see an increase in sales and marketing expenses as we continue to expand our direct sales force to take advantage of opportunities for growth and increase in in-person meetings, conferences, and attendance at trade shows.

General and Administrative

Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs as well as professional services and facilities costs related to our executive, finance, human resources, information technology and legal functions. As a public company, we expect to continue to incur significant accounting and legal costs related to compliance with rules and regulations enacted by the SEC, including the costs of maintaining compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as insurance, investor relations and other costs associated with being a public company.

Lease Modification and Impairment

Lease modification and impairment consists of charges related to the early exit of certain leased office space and amendments to the underlying lease agreement during fiscal year 2023.

Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net

Interest and other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest income from our cash and cash equivalents, gains and losses from foreign currency transactions and remeasurement, and non-cash interest expense related to the amortization of deferred financing costs.
Income Tax (Expense) Benefit

Our income tax (expense) benefit consists of an estimate of federal, state and foreign income taxes based on enacted federal, state and foreign tax rates, as adjusted for allowable credits, deductions, uncertain tax positions, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws. We maintain a full valuation allowance on our federal and state deferred tax assets as we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Income tax expense was $2.1 million for fiscal year 2025 and 2024, respectively. The change in our income tax expense was primarily due to an increase in current taxes in foreign jurisdictions offset by a decrease in current taxes in U.S state jurisdictions. The income tax expense for fiscal years 2025 and 2024 is primarily attributable to current taxes for U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions, respectively.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Sources and Uses of Liquidity

As of June 30, 2025, we had cash and cash equivalents of $313.1 million. We finance our liquidity needs primarily through collections from clients, where we generally bill and collect from our clients annually in advance. Our billings are subject to seasonality with billings in the fourth quarter higher than in the other quarters.

Operating losses could continue in the future as we continue to invest in the growth of our business. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2025, along with our JPMorgan Credit Facility described below, will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure, and stock repurchase needs for the next twelve months and beyond.

On October 5, 2021, we entered into a Credit Agreement, as amended on June 6, 2022 and further amended on November 17, 2022, with a group of lenders led by JPMorgan. The Credit Agreement provides for a five-year, senior secured revolving credit facility of $100.0 million with a sub-facility for letters of credit in the aggregate amount of up to $10.0 million. As of June 30, 2025, no amounts have been borrowed under the JPMorgan Credit Facility. For further information refer to Note 11. “Debt” in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our primary uses of cash include personnel-related expenses, third-party cloud infrastructure expenses, research and development, sales and marketing expenses, overhead costs and acquisitions we may make from time to time. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to grow our revenues and the timing and extent of investment across our organization necessary to support growth in our business. In addition, we may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or technologies. We may need to seek additional equity or debt financing in order to meet these future capital requirements. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, or on terms that are acceptable to us, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Operating Activities

During fiscal year 2025, net cash provided by operating activities was $123.5 million, as our net loss of $18.2 million was reduced by $141.7 million of adjustments. These adjustments consisted of $112.5 million of non-cash charges (principally comprising of stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization and amortization of operating lease right-of-use assets) and a net cash inflow of $29.2 million from net changes in operating assets and liabilities. The net cash inflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in deferred revenues of $35.3 million due to our revenue growth and the timing of invoicing, an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $13.5 million due to an increase in accrued bonuses and timing of payments, an increase in other liabilities of $2.2 million due to the timing of payments and a decrease in accounts receivable of $1.2 million due to the timing of billing and collections on our outstanding receivables. These changes were partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $8.0 million, an increase in unbilled receivables of $6.2 million due to the timing of invoicing to our clients, a decrease in operating lease liabilities of $5.1 million due to lease payments and an increase in deferred commissions of $3.7 million due to increased sales.

During fiscal year 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was $67.2 million, as our net loss of $32.0 million was reduced by $99.3 million of adjustments. These adjustments consisted of $82.0 million of non-cash charges (principally comprising of stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization and amortization of operating lease right-of-use assets) and a net cash inflow of $17.3 million from net changes in operating assets and liabilities. The net cash inflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in deferred revenues of $28.3 million due to our revenue growth, an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $9.4 million due to timing of payments, and an increase in other liabilities of $1.4 million due to the timing of payments. These changes were partially offset by a $5.8 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, an increase in accounts receivable of $5.1 million due to growth in our revenues and the timing of billing and collections on our outstanding receivables, a decrease of $4.3 million in operating lease liabilities due to lease payments, an increase in deferred commissions of $4.1 million due to increased sales and an increase of $2.6 million in unbilled receivables due to the timing of invoicing to our clients.
Investing Activities

During fiscal year 2025, net cash used in investing activities was $62.9 million, consisting of $50.9 million cash consideration paid, net of cash acquired for the acquisition of TermSheet, LLC (“TermSheet”), $7.4 million capitalized internal-use software costs, $2.0 million purchase of strategic investments, $1.7 million capital expenditures on property and equipment primarily comprised of computer equipment and leasehold improvements and $0.9 million working capital adjustment related to a prior acquisition.
During fiscal year 2024, net cash used in investing activities was $19.8 million, consisting of $11.0 million cash consideration paid, net of cash acquired for the acquisitions of delphai GmbH and Transform Data International B.V. and its subsidiaries (“TDI”), capitalized internal-use software costs of $6.4 million and capital expenditures of $2.4 million on property and equipment largely of computer equipment and website development costs.

Financing Activities

During fiscal year 2025, net cash provided by financing activities was $41.2 million, primarily comprised of $40.8 million of proceeds from stock option exercises and $4.1 million of proceeds from employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by $3.7 million in payments for contingent consideration and holdbacks related to prior acquisitions.
During fiscal year 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was $30.3 million, primarily comprised of $30.7 million of proceeds from stock option exercises and $3.4 million of proceeds from employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by $3.0 million of payments for the final contingent consideration and cash holdback related to prior acquisitions and $0.8 million of payments related to deferred offering costs in connection with our follow-on public offering.
Stock Repurchase Program
On August 7, 2025, our Board of Directors authorized a common stock repurchase program of up to $150.0 million. The repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any of the common stock or to acquire a specified number of shares and may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion. Repurchases under this program will be funded from our existing cash and cash equivalents or future cash flow.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The process of preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. These estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, future expectations and other factors and assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The most significant estimates and judgments are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are revised when necessary. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates and judgments.

A summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in Note 2. “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue recognition requires judgment and the use of estimates, especially in identifying and evaluating the various non-standard terms and conditions in our contracts with clients and their effect on reported revenues.

We generate revenues from the sale of our SaaS solutions and premium support services related to SaaS, and subscriptions to our term software applications and support services related to licenses. We generate professional services revenues primarily by delivering professional services for the configuration, implementation and upgrade of our solutions.
The estimates and assumptions requiring significant judgment under our revenue recognition policy are as follows:

Identification of the performance obligations

The majority of our contracts contain multiple performance obligations (such as when subscription licenses are sold with support and implementation services) and are typically capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations.
Determination of the transaction price

We determine the transaction price based on the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring our services and products to the client. We estimate variable consideration included in the transaction price if, in our judgment, it is probable that no significant future reversal of cumulative revenues under the contract will occur.

In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined that contracts generally do not include a significant financing component.
Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract

If the contract contains a single performance obligation, we allocate the entire transaction price to the single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price (“SSP”). The determination of SSP involves judgment and is generally based on the contractually stated, observable prices of the promised goods and services charged when sold separately to client. In a contract with multiple performance obligations, we allocate revenues to each performance obligation at the inception of the contract. Some of our performance obligations have observable inputs that are used to determine the SSP of those distinct performance obligations. Where SSP is not directly observable, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs.

Stock-Based Compensation

The fair value of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance-based stock units (“PSUs”) is based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of the grant. We recognize stock-based compensation expense for RSUs over the requisite service period, which is generally four years. We recognize stock-based compensation expense for PSUs in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved, using the graded vesting method. At each reporting period, we reassesses the probability of achievement of the performance conditions and any change in expense resulting from an adjustment to estimates is treated as a cumulative catch-up in the period of the adjustment.

58

Table of Contents

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in our business combinations. We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We have determined that we have one reporting unit for purposes of our annual impairment evaluation. As part of the annual goodwill impairment test, we first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, as a result of its qualitative assessment, the carrying amount of the reporting unit is more than its fair value, an impairment charge in the amount of such excess is recorded to goodwill.

Business Combinations
The allocation of the purchase price in a business combination requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows, discount rates, revenue growth rates, expected lifecycle for acquired technologies, the time and expense to recreate the assets and profit margin a market participant would receive. Such estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. The excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. We evaluate these estimates and assumptions and may record any adjustments to the preliminary estimates to goodwill within the measurement period, which is no later than one year from the acquisition date.
Contingent consideration liabilities arising from business combinations are initially measured at fair value on the acquisition date. Each reporting period thereafter, these obligations are revalued and increases or decreases to the fair value are recorded as adjustments to general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Gains and losses resulting from exchange rate fluctuation on contingent consideration liabilities denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars are recognized in interest and other income, net on the consolidated statements of operations.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitati
ve Disclosures About Market Risk.

We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business, including foreign currency exchange, credit, inflation, and interest rate risks.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar and the functional currency for all of our foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar, except Rekoop Ltd., which uses the British pound.

The majority of our revenue and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars. However, we have foreign currency risks as we have contracts with clients and payroll obligations and a limited number of supply contracts with vendors which have payments denominated in foreign currencies.

The volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy. We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in foreign exchange gains and losses related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We have not engaged in the hedging of foreign currency transactions to date, although we may choose to do so in the future. Our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk relates primarily to our accounts receivable, cash balances, other employee compensation related obligations and lease liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. If a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates were to occur in the future, the resulting gain or loss would be immaterial on our operating results over the next twelve months.
Credit Risk

We routinely assess the creditworthiness of our clients. We have not experienced any material losses related to non-payment of receivables from individual or groups of clients due to loss of creditworthiness during fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023. We had one client that represented in excess of 10% of our accounts receivable balance at each of June 30, 2025 and 2024. Due to these factors, management believes that we do not have additional credit risk beyond the amounts already provided for collection losses in our accounts receivable.

Inflation Risk
We

do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Nonetheless, if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs, particularly if inflationary pressures occur during an economic downturn. Further, our clients may not buy new products or may refrain from expanding current product usage as a result of the impact of increasing costs on their spend. These matters could harm our business, results of operations, or financial condition.
Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash held in cash deposits and cash equivalents invested in money market funds and the JPMorgan Credit Facility.
As of June 30, 2025, we had cash and cash equivalents of $313.1 million held with multiple high credit quality financial institutions, including investments in money market funds. Our investments are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates, which may affect our interest income. A hypothetical 100 basis points increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on our operating results or the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents over the next twelve months.
As of June 30, 2025, we had no outstanding loan balance under our senior secured revolving credit facility. Future borrowings under this facility will accrue interest at a variable rate based on, at our election, either (a) an adjusted secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”, as described in the Credit Agreement) plus a percentage spread (ranging from 1.75% to 2.50%) or (b) an alternate base rate (as described in the Credit Agreement) plus a percentage spread (ranging from 0.75% to 1.50%), in each case based on our total net leverage ratio. As a result, we will be exposed to increased interest rate risk if we draw down on the facility. For further information refer to Note 11. “Debt” in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGIST
ERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Intapp, Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Intapp, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2025, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2025, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated August 20, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Revenues - Revenue Recognition– Refer to Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company derives its revenues from the sale of its SaaS solutions and subscriptions to its term software applications, including support services, as well as the provision of professional services for implementation of its solutions. The majority of the Company’s contracts contain multiple performance obligations. Revenue recognition for contracts with multiple performance obligations requires management judgment, especially in identifying and evaluating the various non-standard terms and conditions in the Company’s contracts with its clients and their effect on reported revenues. Additionally, contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require the Company to identify the performance obligations and allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation using judgment and is generally based on the contractually stated, observable prices of the promised goods and services charged when sold separately.

We identified revenue recognition for certain material revenue contracts with multiple performance obligations as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments made by management in evaluating the impact of any non-standard terms or conditions in these contracts that may impact the total transaction price, identification of performance obligations, and the allocation of revenues. Accordingly, performing audit procedures related to these certain material revenue contracts required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the recognition of revenues from certain material revenue contracts with multiple performance obligations included the following, among others:
•
We tested the effectiveness of controls over revenue recognition, including those over the accounting for non-standard terms, identification of performance obligations, determining the allocation of revenues in arrangements.
•
We evaluated the Company’s accounting policies in the context of the applicable accounting standards.
•
We selected a sample of certain material revenue arrangements and performed the following procedures:
o
We obtained and read the contracts and related contract documentation.
o
We evaluated whether management properly identified the contract terms (including those that are non-standard) and tested management’s application of the Company's policies, including the identification of the performance obligations, determination of the allocation of revenues in the arrangement. 
o
We tested the mathematical accuracy of management's calculations of revenues and the associated timing of revenues recognized in the financial statements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Intapp, Inc.

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Intapp, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of June 30, 2025, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2025, of the Company and our report dated August 20, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

tes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1. Description of Business

Intapp, Inc. (“Intapp” or the “Company”) is a leading global provider of AI-powered solutions for the world’s premier accounting, consulting, investment banking, legal, private capital and real assets firms. Its vertical software as a service (“SaaS”) solutions help professionals apply their collective expertise to make smarter decisions, manage risk, increase competitive advantage and drive new growth. Using the power of Applied AI, its purpose-built vertical SaaS solutions help firms accelerate the flow of information, activate expertise, empower teams, strengthen client relationships, reduce risk, and adapt more quickly in a highly complex ecosystem. The Company serves clients primarily in the United States (“U.S.”) and the United Kingdom (“U.K.”). References to “the Company” in these consolidated financial statements refer to the consolidated operations of Intapp and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and reflect the consolidated results of operations, financial position, and cash flows of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, after eliminating all inter-company transactions and balances.

Certain prior period amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Effective July 1, 2024, the Company adjusted the classification of support services related to subscription license to be included within “license” on the consolidated statements of operations. Prior to July 1, 2024, support services related to subscription license was included in a line item entitled “SaaS and Support.” The presentation of cost of revenues has been conformed to reflect the changes related to the presentation of revenues. Such reclassifications related to the presentation of revenues and cost of revenues did not affect total revenues, operating income, or net income. There was no change to the Company's revenue recognition policy, except for the change in classification noted herein.
Accordingly, effective July 1, 2024, SaaS revenues include subscription fees from clients accessing the Company’s SaaS solutions, premium support services related to SaaS, and updates, if any, to the subscribed service during the subscription term. License revenues include subscription fees from providing clients with the right to functional intellectual property where clients can benefit from the subscription licenses on their own and support services related to the licenses, which entitles clients to receive technical support and software updates, on a when and if available basis. Refer to the Revenue Recognition section in 
Note 2. “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”
Use of Estimates

The preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Those estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition including determination of the standalone selling price (“SSP”) of the deliverables included in multiple deliverable revenue arrangements; allowance for credit losses; the depreciable lives of long-lived assets including intangible assets; the period of benefits of deferred commissions; the fair value of stock-based awards and estimates on the probability of performance vesting conditions; the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations; goodwill and long-lived assets impairment assessment; the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities; the incremental borrowing rate used to determine the operating lease liabilities; valuation allowances on deferred tax assets; fair value of strategic investments; uncertain tax positions; and loss contingencies. The Company evaluates estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors and adjusts those estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ from these estimates, and those differences could be material to the consolidated financial statements.

71

Table of Contents

Segment Information

The Company’s 
Chief Executive Officer
 is the Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”). The CODM reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for the purposes of making operating decisions, allocating resources, and evaluating financial performance.
 As such, the Company has determined that it operates in 
one
 operating and reportable segment.
The CODM is regularly provided with expenses related to cost of revenues, including cost of SaaS, license, and professional services, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative at the consolidated level to manage the Company’s operations, which are identified as significant segment expenses. Since the Company operates as a single operating and reportable segment, these significant segment expenses are the costs and expenses presented on the consolidated statements of operations. In addition, the Company has concluded that stock-based compensation disclosed in Note 12. “Stock-based Compensation” and amortization of acquired intangible assets disclosed in Note 5. “Goodwill and Intangible Assets” also qualify as significant segment expenses. Accordingly, the CODM assesses performance and decides how to allocate resources based on consolidated net loss, as reported on the consolidated statements of operations. Consolidated net loss is used to monitor budget versus actual results in assessing the overall profitability of the business and to guide decisions on how to invest in and grow the business. The measure of segment assets is reported on the balance sheet as total consolidated assets. Other segment items which represent segment expenses that are not significant include interest and other income (expense), net and income tax (expense) benefit, which are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.
The Company’s property and equipment are primarily located in the U.S. Information about geographic revenues is included in Note 3. “Revenues.”
Revenue Recognition

The Company generates revenues from the sale of its SaaS solutions and premium support services related to SaaS, and subscriptions to the Company’s term software applications and support services related to licenses. The Company generates professional services revenues primarily by delivering professional services for the configuration, implementation and upgrade of its solutions.

Revenue is recognized upon the transfer of control of services or to clients in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services or products. The Company applies the following framework to recognize revenues:

•
Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;
•
Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;
•
Determination of the transaction price;
•
Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
•
Recognition of revenues when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation.
The Company records revenues net of applicable sales taxes collected. Sales taxes collected from clients are recorded in other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are remitted to state and local taxing jurisdictions based on the filing requirements of each jurisdiction.

SaaS Revenue

SaaS revenues include subscription fees from clients accessing the Company’s SaaS solutions, premium support services related to SaaS, and updates, if any, to the subscribed service during the subscription term. The Company recognizes SaaS revenues ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract, which is the date when the Company’s service is available to its clients. The Company’s contracts with clients typically include a fixed amount of consideration and are generally non-cancelable and without any refund-type provisions. The Company’s SaaS subscriptions are generally sold as annual or multi-year terms with automatic annual renewal provisions on the expiration of the initial term. The initial term of the Company’s SaaS contract is generally 
one
 to 
three years
 in duration. Contracts with termination for convenience provision in certain multi-year contracts are accounted as an annual contract. Invoice is generally billed in advance on an annual basis for the SaaS and support services upon execution of the initial contract or subsequent renewal.

72

Table of Contents

License Revenue
License revenues include subscription fees from providing clients with the right to functional intellectual property where clients can benefit from the subscription licenses on their own and support services related to the licenses, which entitles clients to receive technical support and software updates, on a when and if available basis. The Company recognizes license revenues related to subscription fees at a point in time when control of the term software application is transferred to the client, which generally occurs at the time of delivery or upon commencement of the renewal term. The Company recognizes license revenues related to support ratably over the term of the support contract which corresponds to the underlying license agreement. Subscription license fees are generally billed in advance on an annual basis over the term of the license arrangement, which is typically non-cancelable.

Professional Services Revenue

Professional services arrangements sold on a time and materials basis are generally invoiced monthly in arrears and revenues are recognized as services are delivered. In instances where professional services arrangements are sold on a fixed price basis, invoicing occurs upon the achievement of project milestones and revenues are recognized over time using an input measure of time incurred to date relative to total estimated time to be incurred at project completion.
Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations

The Company reviewed and concluded that each of the SaaS subscription, support services, subscription license and professional services noted above are performance obligations that are capable of being distinct. The Company evaluates the terms and conditions included within its client contracts to ensure appropriate revenue recognition, including whether products and services are considered distinct in the context of the contract and therefore should be accounted for separately or combined. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative SSP basis.
The Company uses historical sales transaction data, market conditions and other observable inputs, to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. The Company’s SSP ranges are reassessed periodically or when facts and circumstances change.
Contract Modifications

Contracts may be modified to account for changes in contract scope or price. The Company considers contract modifications to exist when the modification either creates new rights or obligations or changes the existing enforceable rights and obligations of either party. Contract modifications are accounted for prospectively when it results in the promise to deliver additional products and services that are distinct and contract price does not increase by an amount that reflects SSP for the new goods or services.

73

Table of Contents

Contract Balances
Contract Assets
The Company records contract assets when revenue recognized on a contract exceeds the billings. This generally occurs in multi-year subscription license arrangements where control of the software license is transferred at the inception of the contract, but the client is invoiced annually in advance over the term of the license.
Contract Liabilities

Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenues amounts from invoices related to unsatisfied performance obligation where the Company has the right to invoice in advance of revenue being recognized. Deferred revenue expected to be recognized within twelve months of the balance date is classified as current, while amounts exceeding this period are recorded as noncurrent.
Deferred Commissions

The Company capitalizes commissions earned by its sales team as they are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a client. Deferred commissions are amortized over a period of benefits that the Company has determined to be generally 
four years
. The Company determines the period of benefits based on its technology development life cycle, expected client relationship period and other factors. C
ommissions for renewal contracts are amortized over 
one year
.

Deferred commissions are amortized based on the pattern of the associated revenue recognition over the related contract term. Amortization of deferred commissions is included in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Deferred commissions are reviewed periodically for impairment. Refer to Note 3. “Revenues” for more information.
Cost of Revenues

Cost of revenues consists primarily of expenses related to providing SaaS solutions, premium support services related to SaaS, support services related to license and professional services to the Company’s clients, including personnel costs (salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation) and related expenses for client support and services personnel, as well as cloud infrastructure costs, third-party expenses, depreciation of fixed assets, amortization of capitalized internal-use software costs and acquired intangible assets, and allocated overhead costs.

Research and Development Costs

Research and development expenses include personnel costs (salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation) and related expenses associated with engineering and product development employees, costs of third-party services, cloud infrastructure costs, and allocated overhead costs.

Advertising Costs

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $
1.6
 million, $
1.5
 million and $
1.3
 million for fiscal years ended 
June 30, 2025, 2024
 and 2023, respectively.

74

Table of Contents

Stock-Based Compensation

Compensation expense related to stock-based awards made to employees, consultants and directors are calculated based on the fair value of stock-based awards on the date of grant. The Company determines the grant date fair value of the restricted stock units based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The Company determines the grant date fair value of stock option awards and stock purchase rights under the 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires the Company to make assumptions and judgments about the variables used in the calculation, including the expected term (weighted-average period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding), the volatility of the Company’s common stock, an assumed risk-free interest rate and the expected dividend yield. The Company uses historical experience and future expectations to determine the expected term, and volatility is based on the historical volatilities of the Company's common stock. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the option. The Company has
 never declared or paid any cash dividends on the common stock and does not plan to pay cash dividends on the common stock in the foreseeable future, and, therefore, an expected dividend yield is

.

The related stock-based compensation for stock option awards and restricted stock units is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations on a straight-line basis, over the period in which a participant is required to provide service in exchange for the stock-based awards, which is generally 
four years
. The Company recognizes compensation expense related to ESPP over the respective offering period, which is 
6 months
. The Company recognizes forfeitures of stock-based awards as they occur.
The Company has issued performance-based stock options and performance-based stock units that vest based upon continued service through the vesting term and achievement of certain performance conditions established by the Board of Directors for a predetermined period. The Company measures stock-based compensation expense for performance-based stock options based on the estimated grant date fair value determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The Company measures the fair value of the performance-based stock units based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The Company recognizes compensation expense for such awards in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved. Compensation expense for awards that contain performance conditions is calculated using the graded vesting method and at each reporting period, the Company reassesses the probability of achievement of the performance conditions and any change in expense resulting from an adjustment to estimates is treated as a cumulative catch-up in the period of the adjustment.
Restricted Cash

Restricted cash represents amounts held as collateral under certain facility lease agreements.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

All highly-liquid investments with a remaining maturity of 90 days or less at the time of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist primarily of investments in institutional money market funds. The fair value of money market funds held was $
243.2
 million and $
78.7
 million as of 
June 30, 2025 and 2024
, respectively.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Expected Credit Losses
Accounts receivable are recorded at invoiced amounts, net of allowance for expected credit losses for estimated losses resulting from its clients failing to make required payments for subscriptions or services rendered. The Company evaluates the collectability of its accounts receivable based on known collection risks, historical experience, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions and management judgment. Sufficiency of the allowance is assessed based upon knowledge of credit-worthiness of the Company’s clients, review of historical receivable and reserves trends and other pertinent information. Actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from these estimates.

Changes in the allowance for expected credit losses are recorded as general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations and were not material for any of the periods presented.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Construction-in-progress primarily consists of the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed into service for their intended use. Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets and commences once the asset is ready to be placed in service. Depreciation on property and equipment, excluding leasehold improvements, ranges from 
two
 to 
seven years
. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the respective assets or the remaining lease term. When assets are sold, or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the balance sheet and any gain or loss is reflected in operating expenses. Maintenance and repair costs that do not extend the useful life of the assets are expensed as incurred.

Internal-Use Software Costs
Costs related to software acquired, developed, or modified solely to meet the Company’s internal requirements, with no substantive plans to market such software at the time of development, or costs related to development of hosted SaaS products are capitalized during the application development stage. Capitalized internal-use software costs are recorded in Property and equipment, net on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Once the products are available for general release, capitalized costs are amortized to cost of revenue related to SaaS in the consolidated statements of operations 
on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, which is generally 
four years
. The Company
 evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.

Qualifying implementation costs incurred in cloud computing arrangements incurred during the application development stage are capitalized based on the existing guidance for internal-use software, which is presented as part of the prepaid expenses and other assets based on the term of the associated cloud computing arrangement. The capitalized 
implementation costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the associated cloud computing arrangement when the module or component of the cloud computing arrangement is ready for its intended use in the same line item as fees for the associated cloud computing arrangement in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.

Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable. The Company has determined that it is comprised of 
one
 reporting unit for purposes of its annual impairment evaluation. As part of the annual goodwill impairment test, the Company first assesses the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If, as a result of its qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed. The quantitative goodwill impairment test identifies goodwill impairment and measures the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized by comparing the fair value of the single reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the fair value exceeds its carrying amount, no further analysis is required; otherwise, any excess of the goodwill carrying amount over the implied fair value is recognized as an impairment loss, and the carrying value of goodwill is written down to fair value.

Intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of entities are estimated by the Company based on the fair value of assets received. Acquired intangible assets consist of client relationships, non-compete agreements, trademarks and trade names, core technology and backlog and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the useful life with 
no
 calculated residual value, which is generally 
two
 to 
seven years
. 
The Company reviews acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable or that the useful life is shorter than what was originally estimated. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of each asset group to the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group over its remaining life. If the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying

76

Table of Contents

amount 
of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group. If the useful life is shorter than originally estimated, the remaining carrying value is amortized over the new shorter useful life.

Impairment Assessment of Long-lived Assets

The Company reviews long-lived assets with finite lives, which include property and equipment, capitalized internal-use software, lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and acquired intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable or that the useful life is shorter than what was originally estimated. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of each asset group to the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group over its remaining life. If the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group. If the useful life is shorter than originally estimated, the remaining carrying value is amortized over the new shorter useful life.
Business Combinations

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, where the Company allocates the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on best estimates and assumptions. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, revenues and expense forecasts based on trends of historical performance and management’s estimate of future performance from a market participant perspective, and estimated future cash flows discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital. Such estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. The Company continues to collect information and reevaluate these estimates and assumptions and record any adjustments to the preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that the Company is within the measurement period. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the consolidated statements of operations. Expenses incurred in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.

Contingent consideration liabilities arising from business combinations are initially measured at fair value on the acquisition date. Each reporting period thereafter, these obligations are revalued and increases or decreases to the fair value are recorded as adjustments to general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Gains and losses resulting from exchange rate fluctuation on contingent consideration liabilities denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars are recognized in interest and other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of operations.

Table of Contents

Strategic Investments
Strategic investments consist of equity investments in privately-held companies, which are classified as other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s strategic investments do not have readily determinable fair values. These investments are accounted for using the measurement alternative at cost, and the Company adjusts for impairments and observable price changes (orderly transactions for the identical or a similar security from the same issuer) included within interest and other income (expense), net on its consolidated statements of operations as and when it occurs. The measurement alternative election is reassessed each reporting period to determine whether the strategic investments continue to be eligible for this election. The Company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable. Impairment indicators may include, but are not limited to, a significant deterioration in earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality or business outlook or a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment. If the strategic investments are considered impaired, the Company will record an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the investment. 
No
 impairment of strategic investment has been identified during the periods presented. The Company’s maximum loss exposure is limited to the carrying value of these investments.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Company applies authoritative guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures for financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis and nonfinancial assets and liabilities. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value.

Leases

The Company leases its office space under non-cancelable operating lease agreements. The Company determines whether an arrangement constitutes a lease and records lease liabilities and ROU assets on its consolidated balance sheets at the lease commencement date. Lease liabilities are measured based on the present value of the total lease payments not yet paid, discounted based on either the rate implicit in the lease or the Company’s incremental borrowing rate, whichever is more readily determinable. Lease liabilities due within 12 months are included within other current liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The incremental borrowing rate is based on an estimate of the Company’s expected senior unsecured borrowing rate based on synthetic credit rating, adjusted for collateralization. ROU assets are measured based on the corresponding lease liability adjusted for (i) payments made to the lessor at or before the lease commencement date, (ii) initial direct costs incurred, and (iii) tenant incentives received, incurred or payable under the lease. Recognition of rent expense begins when the lessor makes the underlying asset available to the Company.

The Company does not assume renewals or early terminations of its leases unless it is reasonably certain to exercise these options at commencement and does not allocate consideration between lease and non-lease components. The Company does not recognize right-of-use assets or lease liabilities for short-term leases, which have a lease term of twelve months or less, and recognize the associated lease payments in the consolidated statements of operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

ROU assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in the circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

Foreign Currency

The functional currency for all of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar, except Rekoop Ltd., which uses the British pound. The Company translates the foreign functional currency financial statements to U.S. dollars for those entities that do not have U.S. dollars as their functional currency using the exchange rates at the balance sheet date for assets and liabilities, the period average exchange rates for revenues and expenses, and the historical exchange rates for equity transactions. The effects of foreign currency translation adjustments are reflected in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.

Foreign currency transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are recorded within interest and other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.

78

Table of Contents

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss

Accumulated other comprehensive loss, which is reported in the accompanying consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity, consists of net loss and foreign currency translation adjustments. The Company’s other comprehensive loss consists of changes in the cumulative effect of translation of financial statements of certain wholly owned foreign subsidiaries that do not have U.S. dollars as their functional currency.

Concentrations of Credit Risk and Significant Clients

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents with multiple high credit quality financial institutions. The Company is exposed to credit risk for cash and cash equivalents held in financial institutions to the extent that such amounts recorded on the balance sheet are in excess of amounts that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Company has not experienced any such losses.

No
 client individually accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s revenues for any of the fiscal years ended 
June 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024
, 
one
 client individually accounted for 
17
% and 
16
% of the Company’s total accounts receivable, respectively.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. These differences are measured using the enacted statutory tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which differences are expected to reverse. The Company recognizes the effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the net amount that it believes is more-likely-than-not to be realized. Management considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.

The Company operates in various tax jurisdictions and is subject to audit by various tax authorities. The Company provides for tax contingencies whenever it is deemed probable that a tax asset has been impaired or a tax liability has been incurred for events such as tax claims or changes in tax laws. Tax contingencies are based upon their technical merits, relative tax law, and the specific facts and circumstances as of each reporting period. The Company establishes liabilities or reduce assets for uncertain tax positions when the Company believes certain tax positions are more likely than not of not being sustained if challenged. Changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes to the amounts recorded for such tax contingencies.

Net Loss Per Share

The Company’s basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period, without consideration of potentially dilutive securities. The diluted net loss per share is calculated by giving effect to all potentially dilutive securities outstanding for the period using the treasury stock method or the if-converted method based on the nature of such securities. For periods in which the Company reports net losses, diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share because potentially dilutive common shares are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive.

Note 4. Business Combinations

TermSheet
On 
April 21, 2025
, the Company through its wholly owned subsidiary, acquired a 
100
% equity interest in TermSheet, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“TermSheet”), a provider of software for real estate teams. Bringing together Intapp’s product and TermSheet creates a strong team of industry experts and will deliver a powerful operating system tailored to the complex needs of the commercial real estate industry. The transaction has been accounted for as a business combination.
The goodwill balance is primarily attributable to the expected revenue opportunities with the Company’s applications and services offerings, acquired workforce, and other assets that are not separately identifiable. This transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition for tax purposes, and therefore both the goodwill and acquired intangible asset are deductible for tax purposes.

As part of the purchase price allocation, the Company recognized identifiable intangible assets of $
3.2
 million for customer relationships and $
9.0
 million for developed technology
. The fair values of these intangible assets were determined using valuation techniques that rely on significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified as Level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy.
The fair value of the customer relationships was estimated using the multi-period excess earnings method, an income-based valuation approach that considers expected future cash flows and contributory asset charges. The estimated useful life of the customer relationships is 
seven years
, based on historical customer retention and the expected economic benefit to the Company. The fair value of the developed technology was determined using the relief-from-royalty method, which estimates value based on projected revenue, an assumed royalty rate, and a risk-adjusted discount rate. The developed technology is being amortized over an estimated useful life of 
four years
, based on the anticipated period of technological relevance and product development cycles.
Acquisition-related transaction costs of $
0.5
 million, consisting primarily of third-party professional fees,

were expensed as incurred and are included in general and administrative expenses in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025.
In connection with the acquisition of TermSheet, the Company is obligated to make cash payments of up to $
15.0
 million over the next two fiscal years, subject to certain performance measures and in some cases, certain service conditions. The entire amount was accounted for as post-combination compensation costs to be recognized over the performance measurement period, when it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved. The Company reassesses the probability of achievement of the performance conditions at each reporting period and any change in expense resulting from an adjustment to estimates is treated as a cumulative catch-up in the period of the adjustment. The deferred consideration liability was included in other current liabilities and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and the related expenses are classified in the consolidated statements of operations based on the nature of the services rendered.

Note 6. Fair Value Measurements

Financial Assets
The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements as follows
:

Level 1
—Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date;

Level 2
—Inputs are quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability;

Level 3
—Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e., supported by little or no market activity).

86

Table of Contents

Money market funds are classified as Level 1 as the assets are valued using quoted prices in active markets. Liabilities for contingent consideration related to business combinations are classified as Level 3 liabilities as the Company uses unobservable inputs in the valuation, specifically related to the projected total contract value generated by the acquired businesses for a distinct period of time.
The following table sets forth the Company’s financial assets that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of the date indicated by level within the fair value hierarchy (in thousands):

In connection with the acquisition of TDI, the Company recorded a contingent consideration liability of $
0.2
 million on the acquisition date for the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration, which was measured based on the probability of achieving certain performance measures pursuant to the acquisition agreement. Accordingly, the contingent consideration liability was $0.1 million and $
0.2
 million as of 
June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, which were included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.

Table of Contents

In connection with the acquisition of Paragon Data Labs, Inc. in May 2023, the Company recorded a contingent consideration liability of $
4.3
 million on the acquisition date for the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration. The fair value was measured based on the probability of achieving certain performance measures pursuant to the acquisition agreement. The fair value of the contingent consideration was re-measured at $
2.4
 million as of June 30, 
2024. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025
, the Company made a fair value adjustment of $
1.0
 million based on the probability of achieving certain performance measures and paid $
1.4
 million related to the contingent consideration. Accordingly, the contingent consideration was 
nil
 as of 
June 30, 2025
, as compared to the fair value of $
2.4
 million as of June 30, 2024, which was included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
In connection with the acquisition of Billstream, the Company recorded a contingent consideration liability of $
4.1
 million on the acquisition date for the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration. The fair value was measured based on the probability of achieving certain performance measures pursuant to the acquisition agreement. The fair value of the contingent consideration was re-measured at $
2.4
 million and was included in other current liabilities on the balance sheet as of June 30, 2023. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company paid $
1.0
 million in full consideration for the remaining contingent consideration.
The fair value of contingent consideration was initially estimated on the acquisition date primarily using the Monte Carlo simulation and included key assumptions used by management related to the estimated probability of occurrence and discount rates. Subsequent changes in the fair value results from management’s revision of key assumptions and estimates. Changes in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities are recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. Gains and losses resulting from exchange rate fluctuation on contingent consideration liabilities denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars are recognized in interest and other income, net on the consolidated statements of operations.

Litigation

From time to time, the Company is a party to claims, lawsuits, and proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company warrants to its clients that it has all necessary rights and licenses to the intellectual property comprised in its products and services and indemnifies those clients against intellectual property claims with respect to such products and services, so such claims, lawsuits and proceedings might in the future include claims of alleged infringement of intellectual property rights. The Company records a liability when it believes that it is probable that a loss will be incurred, and the amount of loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. Given the unpredictable nature of legal proceedings, the Company bases its estimate on the information available at the time of the assessment. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability and may revise the estimate. The Company is not presently a party to any litigation the outcome of which, it believes would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the business, operating results, or financial condition.
Note 11. Debt

On October 5, 2021, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement, as amended on June 6, 2022 and further amended on November 17, 2022 (the “Credit Agreement”) among the Company, the guarantors party thereto, the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent (“JPMorgan”). The Credit Agreement provides for a 
five-year
, senior secured revolving credit facility of $
100.0
 million with a sub-facility for letters of credit in the aggregate amount of up to $
10.0
 million (the “JPMorgan Credit Facility”). The Credit Agreement also provides that the Company may seek additional revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed $
50.0
 million, subject to certain administrative procedures, including approval by the Administrative Agent. Future borrowings under the JPMorgan Credit Facility will bear interest, at the Company’s election, at an annual rate based on either (a) an adjusted SOFR (as described in the Credit Agreement) plus a percentage spread (ranging from 
1.75
% to 
2.50
%) or (b) an alternate base rate (as described in the Credit Agreement) plus a percentage spread (ranging from 
0.75
% to 
1.50
%), in each case based on the Company’s total net leverage ratio. In addition, a commitment fee accrues with respect to the unused amount of the JPMorgan Credit Facility at an annual rate ranging from 
0.25
% to 
0.40
%, based on the Company’s total net leverage ratio.

91

Table of Contents

In connection with the execution of the Credit Agreement, the Company also entered into a pledge and security agreement (the “Security Agreement”) dated as of October 5, 2021 among the Company, the subsidiary grantors thereto and JPMorgan, as administrative agent for the secured parties. Under the Security Agreement, borrowings under the JPMorgan Credit Facility are secured by a first priority pledge of all of the capital stock and substantially all of the assets (excluding real estate interests) of each subsidiary of the Company and the subsidiary guarantors.
The Credit Agreement provides that the Company must maintain compliance with a maximum consolidated total net leverage ratio covenant, as determined in accordance with the Credit Agreement. It also contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, including limitations on certain other indebtedness, loans and investments, liens, mergers, asset sales, and transactions with affiliates, as well as customary events of default.

The Company was in compliance with all covenants as of June 30, 2025. As of June 30, 2025
, there were 
no
 outstanding borrowings under the JPMorgan Credit Facility.
Note 12. Stock-Based Compensation

Equity Incentive Plans
In June 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted, and its stockholders approved, the 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”) and the ESPP. The 2021 Plan provides for the grant of restricted shares, RSUs, performance shares, PSUs, deferred share units, share options and share appreciation rights. All employees, non-employee directors and selected third-party service providers of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates are eligible to receive grants under the 2021 Plan. Eligible employees may purchase the Company’s common stock under the ESPP.
Both the 2021 Plan and ESPP include a provision to increase the share reserves on July 1 of each year through 2031. On July 1, 2025, 
4,491,059
 and 
898,211
 shares were added to the 2021 Plan and ESPP, respectively.

Stock Awards
The Company has granted time-based and performance-based stock options, RSUs and PSUs, collectively referred to as “Stock Awards.” The Company accounts for stock-based compensation using the fair value method which requires the Company to measure stock-based compensation based on the grant-date fair value of the awards and recognize compensation expense over the requisite service or performance period. Awards that contain only service conditions, are generally earned over four years and expensed on a straight-line basis over that term. Compensation expense for awards that contain performance conditions is calculated using the graded vesting method and the portion of expense recognized in any period may fluctuate depending on changing estimates of the achievement of the performance conditions.
Stock Options
Stock options granted generally become exercisable ratably over a 
four-year
 period following the date of grant and expire 
ten years
 from the date of grant.

As of June 30, 2025
, the Company has federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $
171.3
 million and $
188.4
 million, respectively, which expire beginning in the year 
2034
 for federal and 
2025
 for the state of California.
As of June 30, 2025
, the Company has federal and state research credits carryforwards of approximately $
15.8
 million and $
7.3
 million, respectively, expiring beginning in 
2027
 for federal. The state credits can be carried forward indefinitely.
Federal and state tax laws impose substantial restrictions on the utilization, for tax purposes, of net operating loss and credit carryforwards in the event of an ownership change as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, the Company’s ability to utilize these carryforwards may be limited as a result of such ownership change. Such a limitation could result in the expiration of carryforwards before they are utilized.
In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considered all available evidence both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, legislative developments, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.
As a result of this analysis as of June 30, 2025 and 2024
, the Company has determined that it is more likely than not that it will not realize the benefits of its deferred tax assets due to continuing losses, and therefore has recorded a valuation allowance of $
144.7
 million and $
100.5
 million, respectively, to reduce the carrying value of its deferred tax assets.
At June 30, 2025
, the Company asserts that it will not permanently reinvest its foreign earnings outside the U.S. The Company anticipates that the cash from its foreign earnings may be used to fund operations domestically, settle a portion of the outstanding debt obligations, or used for other business needs. The accumulated undistributed earnings generated by its foreign subsidiaries was approximately $
39.0
 million. Substantially all of these earnings will not be taxable upon repatriation to the U.S. since under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, they will be treated as previously taxed income or benefit from the dividends received deduction. The withholding taxes related to the distributable earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are not expected to be material.
It is the Company’s policy to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024
, the Company had 
no
 accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions.
The Company does not anticipate any significant increases or decreases to its unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months. There is no applicable lapse of the statute of limitations in the next 12 months.

Note 14. Net Loss Per Share

Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net loss per share is calculated by giving effect to all potentially dilutive securities outstanding for the period using the treasury stock method.

Basic net loss per share is the same as diluted net loss per share because the Company reported net losses for all periods presented. 
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share for the periods presented (in thousands, except per share data):

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in “Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2025.
Our independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued an audit report with respect to our internal control over financial reporting, which is included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Table of Contents

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
