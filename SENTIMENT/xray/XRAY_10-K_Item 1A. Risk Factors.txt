•
Our foreign currency hedging and cash management transactions may be ineffective or only partially mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, exposing us to unexpected volatility.
•
Due to the global nature of our business, including increasing exposure to markets outside of the United States, political or economic changes or other factors could harm our business and financial performance.
•
Management previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, some of which resulted in errors in previously issued financial statements. These material weaknesses were all remediated as of December 31, 2023. If we experience additional material weaknesses in the future, we may be unable to accurately and timely report financial results or comply with the requirements for public companies, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline or limit our access to the capital markets. 
•
Lack of global standardized processes could result in control deficiencies and adversely impact management’s assertions and financial reporting.
•
We may be subject to additional litigation and regulatory examinations, investigations, proceedings or court orders relating to the completed 2022 internal investigation regarding certain financial reporting matters. If any of these items are resolved adversely to us, it could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
•
We may be unable to obtain necessary product approvals and marketing clearances.
•
Changes in tax rules or interpretations of tax rules, operating structures, transfer pricing regulations, country profitability mix and regulations and tax investigations, audits, or other proceedings that we are subject to may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations, including by adversely affecting our effective tax rate.
•
We voluntarily suspended the sale and marketing of our direct-to-consumer Byte aligner systems and impression kits, and subsequently determined to cease offering these aligners to new patients while repurposing Byte technologies and capabilities to support other products within our aligner portfolio. As a result, we have experienced a material impact on our results of operations, and we may be required to take additional significant impairment charges if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to reposition Byte.
•

Below is a full description of each of such significant risk factors. 
RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESSES
We rely heavily on information technology to operate our businesses and product portfolios, and any cyber incidents could harm our operations and have a material impact on our business and financial results.
We are exposed to the risk of cyber incidents, which can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events, in the normal course of business. We use integrated information and technology systems to manage our business and deliver products and services to customers. In particular, the 2022 launch of DS Core, our cloud platform that integrates digital dentistry workflows across devices, and the 2024 launch of Primescan 2, a cloud-native intraoral scanner, have introduced new potential vulnerabilities to cyber attacks. The breadth and complexity of our information and technology systems have increased and we expect that they will continue to increase as we expand the services enabled by DS Core and further develop our ERP systems and product offerings to utilize artificial intelligence (“AI”) and analytics. As a result, we will increasingly be exposed to risks inherent in the development, integration and operation of the evolving information and technology supporting our product platforms, as well as our own internal infrastructure, including:
•    security breaches, viruses, cyberattacks, ransomware or other malware or other failures, cyber incidents or malfunctions; 
•    disruption, impairment or failure of data centers or hardware, telecommunications facilities or other infrastructure, including due to natural disasters;
•    failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components;
•    the compromise or unauthorized disclosure of sensitive, personal, proprietary or intellectual property information related to our business and customers; 
•    excessive costs, excessive delays or other deficiencies in systems development and deployment; and
•    an unintentional event that involves a third party gaining unauthorized access to our systems or proprietary information.
 We also utilize systems, applications and data storage provided and maintained by third parties, including those delivered through cloud-based solutions. Any disruptions to or deterioration of our distribution partners’ or service providers’ information and technology infrastructures could pose a threat to our operations and harm our business.
15
Like other large, global companies, during the normal course of business, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience cyber threats, attacks and other attempts to compromise our information systems, with such attacks and threats rapidly increasing in both sophistication and frequency. However, none, to our knowledge, have had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations to date. Our policies, required employee training (including that which relates to phishing prevention), procedures and technical safeguards may be insufficient to prevent or detect improper access to confidential, proprietary or sensitive data, including personal data. Cyberattacks could also cause us to incur significant costs, disrupt key business operations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources. We also face the ongoing challenge of controlling access to our information and technology infrastructure. We have experienced various cyber incidents in the past and have implemented new controls, governance, protections and procedures as a result. If we do not successfully manage these access controls, it could expose us to the risk of security breaches or disruptions. Although past cybersecurity incidents have not had a material effect on our business or operations, and although we and our service providers take efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and anticipate, detect, avoid or mitigate such threats, we cannot provide assurances that a future cyberattack would not result in material harm to our business and results of operations. Disaster recovery plans, where in place, might not adequately protect us in the event of a system failure. Further, we currently do not have excess or standby computer processing or network capacity everywhere in the world to avoid disruption in the event of a system failure. Despite any precautions we take, damage from natural disasters, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, break-ins, human error or similar events at our computer facilities could result in interruptions in the flow of data to our servers, although we have not yet experienced such an interruption. While we have invested and continue to invest in information technology risk management and disaster recovery plans, these measures cannot fully insulate us from cyber incidents, technology disruptions or data loss and the resulting adverse effect on our operations and financial results. If our information systems are breached again, sensitive and proprietary data is compromised, surreptitiously modified, rendered inaccessible for any period of time or made public, or if we fail to make adequate or timely disclosures to affected individuals, appropriate state and federal regulatory authorities or law enforcement agencies, it could result in significant fines, penalties, court orders, sanctions and proceedings or actions against us by governmental or other regulatory authorities, customers or third parties. We may incur substantial costs and suffer other negative consequences such as liability, reputational harm and significant remediation costs and experience material harm to our business and financial results if we experience cyber incidents in the future.
AI-based platforms and tools are increasingly being used in the consumer health industries, and our use of this technology, as well as its use by our business partners, may continue to increase and could lead to the unintentional release of our confidential information, which could negatively impact us, including our ability to realize the benefits of our intellectual property. Additionally, the advancement of AI and large language models has given rise to additional vulnerabilities and potential entry points for cyber threats; threat actors may have additional tools to automate breaches or persistent attacks, evade detection, generate sophisticated phishing emails, or impersonate employees or senior management. Our use of AI in our products and processes and the use of AI by our business partners may lead to novel cybersecurity, legal and regulatory risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and reputation as well as the operations of our business partners.
Additionally, we seek to maintain insurance coverage for cybersecurity risks, but such insurance has become increasingly difficult to secure and, in some cases, policies may not provide adequate coverage for possible losses. Further, as cybersecurity risks evolve, such insurance may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Uninsured losses or operational losses that result from large deductible payments under commercial insurance coverage might have an adverse impact on our business operations, financial position or results of operations.
Evolving governmental oversight of the use of personal information, cross-border data transfer restrictions and the use of emerging technologies, including AI, as well as other technology regulations, may adversely affect our business.
We collect and process personally identifiable information (“PII”) and other data as part of our business processes and activities. This data is subject to an increasing number of U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including oversight by regulatory or governmental bodies. The EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), for example, imposes stringent data protection requirements and provides significant penalties for noncompliance. Fines for noncompliance can amount to up to €20 million or 4% of the total worldwide annual sales from the preceding financial year (whichever is higher) and may be imposed in conjunction with the exercise of the authority’s investigatory and corrective powers. The GDPR’s extraterritorial scope makes it applicable to our U.S.-based legal entities whenever our business activities process the personal data of EU residents. Privacy laws, rules and regulations are also rapidly developing in other regions, including China, Brazil and South Korea, and the United States. 
In the United States, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and its implementing regulations (collectively, “HIPAA”) impose certain requirements on covered entities and their business associates 
16
to protect the privacy and security of protected health information (“PHI”) and to provide notification in the event of a breach of PHI. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights (“OCR”), which is responsible for enforcing HIPAA, also may enter into resolution agreements requiring the payment of civil money penalties and/or the establishment of corrective action plans to address violations of HIPAA. Pursuant to HIPAA, OCR has adopted privacy regulations to govern the use and disclosure of PHI and data security regulations that require the implementation of safeguards to protect electronic PHI.
Our Company, through its various subsidiaries, functions as both a covered entity and a business associate under HIPAA. Where necessary, we have segregated our data to ensure that PHI is handled in accordance with HIPAA requirements. We believe that we have implemented appropriate policies and procedures and security measures necessary to comply with HIPAA. However, despite our compliance efforts, we may suffer a serious breach of PHI or be subject to a cyberattack that compromises the PHI that we maintain.
Additionally, federal and state privacy and security-related laws may be more restrictive than HIPAA and could impose additional penalties. For example, the Federal Trade Commission uses its consumer protection authority to initiate enforcement actions in response to alleged privacy violations and data breaches. The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) created additional data privacy obligations for covered companies and a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches. In addition, the California Privacy Rights Act further expanded the CCPA to provide even greater rights to California consumers with respect to their data. Other states have followed California by implementing data privacy laws, including, but not limited to, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, Virginia, and Washington. If we suffer a serious breach of personal data, we may be subject to breach notification requirements, government investigations, media inquiries, civil and criminal fines and penalties, litigation, and negative public perception, and we may be required to expend substantial financial and personnel resources. Any liability from failing to comply with applicable privacy and data protection laws could adversely affect our operations and our financial condition.
These varying laws, rules, regulations and industry standards impact our businesses to the extent we rely on the use of personal data, including PHI, and create significant compliance challenges. In addition, certain privacy and data protection laws may apply to us indirectly through our customers, manufacturers, suppliers or other third-party partners. For example, non-compliance with applicable laws or regulations by a third-party partner that is processing personal data on our behalf may be deemed to be non-compliance or a failure to conduct proper due diligence. Any inability, or perceived inability, to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns or to comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, contractual obligations, or other legal obligations (including at newly acquired companies) could result in additional cost and liability to us or our officers, damage our reputation, inhibit sales, and otherwise adversely affect our business.
Moreover, global regulation related to the provision of services on the Internet is increasing, as governments continue to adopt new laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection, processing, storage and use of personal information. Such laws and regulations are subject to new and differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. These and other requirements could restrict our ability to store and process data or impact our ability to offer future digital dentistry products and services in certain locations. The costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by these types of laws, regulations and standards may limit the adoption of our products or services or lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance, any of which could harm our business.
In addition, the legal and regulatory landscape surrounding AI technologies is rapidly evolving and uncertain, especially in the areas of intellectual property, cybersecurity, and privacy and data protection. For example, there is uncertainty around the validity and enforceability of intellectual property rights related to the use, development, and deployment of AI. Compliance with new or changing laws, regulations or industry standards relating to AI may impose significant operational costs and may limit the ability of the Company and our business partners to develop, deploy or use AI technologies. Failure to appropriately respond to this evolving landscape may result in legal liability, regulatory action, or brand and reputational harm. 
New and more stringent multinational, national and state technology legislation and regulations may be adopted in 2025 and beyond. We cannot predict the scope of new legislation, regulation or enforcement, the jurisdictions that may be involved, or impact. Failure to comply with technology laws and regulations could result in enforcement actions (which could include substantial penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Although we currently maintain liability insurance intended to cover cyber and certain other privacy and security breach-related claims, we cannot ensure that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover liabilities arising out of claims asserted against us in the future if the outcomes of such claims are unfavorable to us. Liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage, 
17
including coverage for cyber liability and certain other privacy and security breach-related claims, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities.
We may be unable to develop innovative products and solutions to stimulate customer demand.
The worldwide markets for dental and continence care products are highly competitive and are subject to rapid and significant technological disruption. There can be no assurance that our products will not lose their competitive advantage or become obsolete as a result of such factors, or that we will be able to generate any economic return on our investment in product development. If product demand or sales effectiveness decreases, or if our newly introduced products are not accepted by our customers, our revenue and profit could be negatively impacted. Important factors that could cause demand for our products to decrease include changes in:
•
business conditions, including downturns in the dental industry, regional economies, and the overall economy;
•
the level of customers’ inventories;
•
evolving industry practices;
•
competitive and pricing pressures, including actions taken or new products introduced by competitors;
•
customer product needs and preferences and customer/patient lifecycle; and 
•
patient reimbursement trends which could lead to a drop in patient volumes at our customers’ dental practices.
If we fail to innovate existing technologies or develop new technologies consistent with changing consumer preferences and security requirements or fail to differentiate our products from our competition, our technology or products may become obsolete and cause us to lose market share and revenue. While we have identified the development of new technologies and products as an important part of our growth strategy, there is no assurance that new technology, products or approaches to dental treatment will not render our products obsolete, and there is no assurance that capital allocated to R&D will yield expected benefits. Additionally, the rapid pace of technological advancements may accelerate amortization faster than we anticipated or impair investments in our software technology, which could negatively impact our results.
Damage to our reputation or brand could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.
We seek to maintain our reputation, and successful promotion of our brand depends on multiple factors, including our marketing efforts and our ability to deliver a superior customer experience, develop innovative products, and differentiate our offerings from those of our competitors. Additionally, the strength of our brand relies on continued effective use of our distribution network and customer service platforms. The promotion of our brand requires us to make substantial expenditures, including continued investments in enhancing customer experience. Our brand promotion activities may not be successful in maintaining or increasing our current level of revenue. If we do not successfully position our brand and reputation as an industry leader, our business and operating results may be adversely affected.
Additionally, our brand depends on our reputation for offering high-quality solutions meeting the highest of safety standards. A serious breach of our quality assurance or quality control procedures, deterioration of our quality image, impairment of our customer or consumer relationships or failure to adequately protect the relevance of our brands may lead to litigation, customers purchasing from our competitors, other brands or private labels not manufactured by us, or regulatory enforcement action, any of which could have a material negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
18
Our ongoing business operations may be disrupted for a significant period of time, resulting in material operating costs and financial losses.
We operate in approximately 150 countries and our suppliers’ manufacturing facilities are located in multiple locations around the world. Potential events such as extreme weather, natural disasters, regional epidemics or global pandemics, worker strikes and social and political actions, such as trade wars, regional wars or conflicts or other events beyond our control, could impact our ongoing business operations, including due to disruptions at critical third-party vendors or the loss of critical information technology and telecommunications systems. Although we maintain multiple manufacturing facilities, a large number of the products manufactured by us are manufactured in facilities that are the sole source of such products. As there are a limited number of alternative third-party suppliers for these products, any disruption at a particular Company manufacturing facility could lead to delays and increased expenses and may damage our business and results of operations. If our incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective and timely manner, such events could result in an interruption in our operations and could cause material negative impacts on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Additionally, a significant portion of our injectable anesthetic products, orthodontic products, certain dental cutting instruments, catheters, nickel titanium products and certain other products and raw materials are purchased from a limited number of suppliers and in certain cases single source suppliers pursuant to agreements that are subject to periodic renewal, some of which may also compete with us. As there are a limited number of suppliers for these products, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain an adequate supply of these products and raw materials in the future at acceptable prices. Any delays in delivery of or shortages in these products could interrupt and delay manufacturing of our products and result in the cancellation of orders. In addition, these suppliers could discontinue the manufacture or supply of these products to us or supply products to competitors. We may not be able to identify and integrate alternative sources of supply in a timely fashion, or at all. Any transition to alternate suppliers may result in delays in shipment, increase expenses and limit our ability to deliver products to customers.
We may be unable to execute key strategic initiatives due to competing priorities and strategies of our distribution partners and other factors, which may result in financial losses and operational inefficiencies.
We may be unable to execute our key strategic activities and investments due to operational disruptions impacting our distributors or the competing priorities of our distribution partners, which may introduce additional products that compete with our products at lower price points. If these competing products capture significant market share or result in a decrease in market prices overall, there could be negative impacts on our results of operations and financial condition.
We generate a substantial portion of our revenue through a limited number of distributors that provide important support to end-users. Together, our two largest distributors, Patterson Companies, Inc. (“Patterson”) and Henry Schein, Inc. (“Henry Schein”), accounted for approximately 13% of our annual revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024. 
In July 2024, we delivered a one-year notice of non-renewal to Patterson in connection with its non-exclusive distribution agreements for the distribution of dental equipment in the United States and Canada. It is anticipated that Patterson will continue to be one of our two largest distributors as a percentage of our global revenue during the one-year notice period. We intend to engage in discussions for new distribution agreements with Patterson. However, failure to successfully renegotiate the distribution agreements or secure new agreements with another distributor could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. We have not incurred any charges against earnings in 2024 related to non-renewal of the distribution agreements.
Additionally, the dental market continues to be impacted by price competition, driven in part by the consolidation of dental practices, the growing significance of DSOs, innovation, and end-user price sensitivity. There can be no assurance that our distribution partners will purchase any minimum quantity of products from us or that they will continue to purchase any products at all. If Patterson or Henry Schein ceases to purchase a significant volume of products from us, or if changes in our promotional strategies and investments result in changes in our distributor relationships, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, changes in the capital structure or ownership of distributors could result in changes to our relationship, including shifts in strategies related to inventory management, customer service and servicing the installed base of Dentsply Sirona products. Changes to agreements with distributors, including expiration of existing agreements, could result in a reduction in the amount of inventory ordinarily held in the absence of contractual minimum inventory requirements.
We rely in part on our distributor and customer relationships and predictions of distributor and customer inventory levels in projecting future demand levels and financial results. These inventory levels may fluctuate, and may differ from our predictions, resulting in our projections of future results being different than expected. These changes may be influenced by 
19
changing relationships with distributors and customers, economic conditions, and customer preference for particular products. There can be no assurance that distributors and customers will maintain levels of inventory in accordance with our predictions or past history or that the timing of customers’ inventory changes will be in accordance with our expectations. Any disruptions to our distributors’ operations or systems may result in delays in orders and shipments and may prevent our products from being timely delivered to the market.
Our acquisitions, exiting of businesses, divestitures or strategic investments may result in financial results that are different than expected and create certain risks for our business and operations.
We intend to continue utilizing acquisitions, dispositions, and strategic investments as a part of our strategy for growth and to improve financial results. We have made, and may continue to make in the future, acquisitions to enhance our business and product portfolio, which require us to invest significant resources to integrate the businesses we acquire. We also periodically evaluate our businesses and assets for potential disposition as a key part of our strategy, including the previously disclosed evaluation of strategic alternatives for our Wellspect Healthcare business. The success of each acquisition or divestiture depends in part on our ability to realize opportunities and manage risks, including challenges executing transactions, higher operating expenses, litigation, adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers, and the potential loss of key employees, customers, distributors, vendors, and other business partners. The process of continuing to evaluate acquisitions, divestitures or strategic investments may be costly, time-consuming and complex, including requiring management to devote significant time and attention to these types of transactions that may distract our management and disrupt our ongoing business operations or relationships. We may incur significant legal, accounting and advisory fees and other expenses, some of which may be incurred regardless of whether we successfully enter into a transaction. We may not achieve expected returns and benefits in connection with acquisitions as a result of various factors, including integration challenges, such as those relating to personnel and technology, and we may not achieve financial results consistent with revenue growth expectations and cost synergies anticipated from integration activities.
After reaching an agreement for the acquisition or disposition of assets or a business, the transaction may remain subject to regulatory and governmental approvals and the satisfaction of pre-closing conditions, which may prevent us from completing a given transaction in a timely manner, or at all. Acquisitions may require us to incur debt, assume contingent liabilities and/or additional risks, or create additional expenses to consummate the transaction, any of which might adversely affect our financial results. 
When we pursue the divestiture of a business, we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or executing alternative exit strategies in a timely manner, which could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives. Alternatively, we may dispose of a business at a valuation or on terms that are less favorable than we had anticipated, or with the exclusion of select assets. Dispositions may also involve continued involvement in a divested business, such as through continuing equity ownership, transition service agreements, guarantees, indemnities or other financial obligations. Under these arrangements, the performance of the divested business, or other conditions outside our control, could affect our future financial results. If we are not successful in setting forth a new strategic vision for Wellspect, or if our plans are not executed in a timely fashion, this may cause reputational harm with our stockholders and the value of our securities may be adversely impacted.
We may fail to realize the expected benefits of our strategic initiatives, including executed, announced, or potential future restructuring and other business transformation efforts.
In order to improve performance and drive value creation, we implemented a restructuring plan during 2024 (the “2024 Plan”). In connection with the 2024 Plan, we anticipate a net reduction in our global workforce of approximately 2% to 4%. The proposed changes are subject to co-determination processes with employee representative groups in countries where required. Actions taken under the 2024 Plan will seek to further streamline our operations and global footprint, as well as improve alignment of our cost structure with strategic growth objectives. 
In addition, we made restructuring changes during 2023 (the “2023 Plan”). The 2023 Plan plans included implementation of a new operating model with five global business units designed to align our product portfolio with our growth strategy, infrastructure optimization to support efficiency, and other initiatives aimed at delivering cost savings. 
We are also in the process of implementing a new global ERP system, which will upgrade and standardize our existing information systems. Beginning in 2023 and continuing through 2024, we made capital investments in this system, which has resulted in significant costs and uses of cash that are expected to continue in the future. Implementation is expected to take several years to complete, and cost overruns or any disruptions, delays or complications could lead to higher than anticipated capital investments and related costs, distract from our core business, or result in failures to produce financial information accurately and timely and may adversely impact our financial results. The failure to either deliver the application on time or 
20
anticipate readiness and training needs could lead to business disruptions. The quarterly timing of sales may also be impacted as distributors adjust their buying patterns and inventory levels in anticipation of potential business disruptions related to the implementation of our new ERP system.

Failure or abandonment of any part of the ERP system could result in a write-off of part or all of the costs that have been capitalized on the project.
Additionally, our ability to achieve benefits from our strategic initiatives within the expected timeframe is subject to many estimates, assumptions, and other factors that we may not be able to control. We may also incur charges related to restructuring plans that are higher than anticipated, which would reduce our profitability in the periods such charges are incurred.
Due to the complexities inherent in implementing these types of cost reduction and restructuring activities, and the timing of strategic investments, we may fail to realize expected efficiencies and benefits or may experience a delay in realizing such efficiencies and benefits, and our operations and business could be disrupted. Company management may be required to divert their focus to these disruptions, and implementation may require the agreement of third parties, such as labor unions or works councils. Risks associated with these actions and other workforce management issues include delays in workforce reductions, additional unexpected costs, changes in restructuring plans that modify the number of employees affected, negative impacts on our relationship with labor unions or works councils, adverse effects on employee morale, and failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees, any of which may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or may otherwise harm our business, and could have a material adverse effect on our sales growth and other results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, or competitive position.
We have recognized substantial goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges and may be required to recognize additional goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges in the future.
We have acquired other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. We review amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment at least annually. The valuation models used to determine the fair value of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets are dependent upon various assumptions and reflect management’s best estimates. 
The goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment analyses are sensitive to changes in key assumptions used, such as discount rates, revenue growth rates, perpetual revenue growth rates, operating margin percentages, and net working capital assumptions of the business as well as current market conditions affecting the dental and medical device industries. Given the uncertainty in the marketplace and other factors affecting management’s assumptions, there is a risk of future impairment charges if there is a decline in the fair value of the reporting units or indefinite-lived intangible assets as a result of, among other things, financial results lower than forecasts, adverse changes in valuation assumptions, a decline in equity valuations, increases in interest rates, or changes in the use of intangible assets. There can be no assurance that our future asset impairment testing will not result in a material charge to earnings.
In the quarter ended March 31, 2024, we identified indicators of a more likely than not impairment related to certain indefinite-lived imaging product trade names within the Connected Technology Solutions segment. The decline in fair value of these indefinite-lived trade names was driven by declines in volumes during the three months ended March 31, 2024, which was due in part to a loss in market share from competitive pricing pressures, as well as unfavorable economic conditions in certain markets. These factors contributed to a reduction in forecasted revenues in the near term. The trade names were evaluated for impairment using an income approach, specifically a relief from royalty method. As a result, we recorded an indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge of $6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024.
In the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company identified indicators of a more likely than not impairment for two of its reporting units, Orthodontic Aligner Solutions and Implant & Prosthetic Solutions, which together comprise all of the Orthodontic and Implant Solutions segment. As a result, the Company recorded pre-tax goodwill impairment charges as of September 30, 2024 of $145 million for the Orthodontic Aligner Solutions reporting unit and $359 million for the Implant & Prosthetic Solutions reporting unit, both within the Orthodontic and Implant Solutions segment. The impairment charge related to the Orthodontic Aligner Solutions reporting unit resulted in a full write-off of the remaining goodwill balance for this reporting unit.
In the quarter ended December 31, 2024, the Company identified indicators of a more likely than not impairment for its Implant & Prosthetic Solutions reporting unit within the Orthodontic and Implant Solutions segment. The decline in fair value of this reporting unit was driven by a weaker trend in sales volumes, particularly in North America, increased competition from lower-priced alternatives impacting global markets, and adverse macroeconomic pressures impacting demand for elective 
21
dental procedures and premium implant solutions. These factors contributed to reduced forecasted revenues, lower operating margins, and reduced expectations for future cash flows. As a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax goodwill impairment charge as of December 31, 2024 of $269 million for the Implant & Prosthetic Solutions reporting unit within the Orthodontic and Implant Solutions segment. For further information, see Note 11, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Additionally, in the quarter ended December 31, 2024, the Company also identified indicators of more likely than not impairments for certain indefinite-lived intangible assets including trade names and trademarks within the Connected Technology Solutions segment, and certain trade names within the Implant & Prosthetic Solutions reporting unit within the Orthodontic and Implant Solutions segment. The decline in fair value of the trade names and trademarks was driven by weakened demand for our premium equipment and implant products, competitive pricing pressures, and a sustained higher cost of capital, which are contributing to reduced forecasted revenues. As a result, the Company recorded indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $82 million and $1 million for the Connected Technology Solutions and Orthodontic and Implant Solutions segments, respectively, for the three months ended December 31, 2024. For further information, see Note 11, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
The remaining goodwill balance of the Implant & Prosthetic Solutions reporting unit was $503 million as of December 31, 2024, 
and the carrying values of indefinite-lived intangible assets with impairments in the fourth quarter were $76 million and $149 million for the Implant & Prosthetic Solutions and Connected Technology Solutions reporting units, respectively, as of December 31, 2024.
 As the fair values of the Implant & Prosthetic Solutions reporting unit and the indefinite-lived assets within the Implant & Prosthetic Solutions and Connected Technology Solutions reporting units, respectively, continue to approximate carrying value as of December 31, 2024, any further decline in key assumptions could result in future additional impairment. 
At December 31, 2024, we have $337 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets and $1,597 million of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet.
Our failure to protect our proprietary technology could have an adverse impact on our competitive position.
Our financial results may be adversely impacted if third parties infringe upon our intellectual property rights or misappropriate our technologies and trademarks. To protect our rights to our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of patent and trademark law, trade secret protection, confidentiality agreements and contractual arrangements with our employees, strategic partners, and others. We cannot assure you that any of our patents, the patents we license or any patents which we receive or license in the future will provide us with a competitive advantage or afford us protection against infringement, or that the patents will not be successfully challenged or circumvented by third parties. The protective steps that we have taken may be inadequate to detect, protect against or deter misappropriation. Effective patent, trademark and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we will offer our products. In addition, there is a risk of employees inadvertently inputting trade secret information into AI technologies, thereby enabling third parties to access such information. Any failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could devalue our proprietary content and impair our ability to compete effectively. Further, defending or enforcing our intellectual property rights could result in the expenditure of significant resources.
Litigation may be necessary to assert claims against others, enforce patents owned by or licensed to us, protect our trade secrets or know-how, or determine the enforceability, scope, and validity of our proprietary rights. An adverse determination in such proceedings could subject us to significant liabilities, allow our competitors to market competitive products without obtaining a license from us, prohibit us from marketing our products or require us to seek licenses from third parties. If we cannot obtain such licenses, we may be restricted or prevented from commercializing our products. If we become involved in litigation, we may incur substantial expense, and the proceedings may divert the attention of key personnel, even if we ultimately prevail. Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents for technology in our products and defend infringement on our patents by third parties that relate to our products, technologies, and processes, both in the United States and in other countries. Risks and uncertainties that we face with respect to our patents and patent applications include the following:
•
pending patent applications may not result in issued patents or may take longer than we expect to result in issued patents;
•
the allowed claims of any patents that are issued may not provide meaningful protection;
•
other companies may challenge patents licensed or issued to us;
•
disputes may arise regarding inventions and corresponding ownership rights in inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by us and our respective licensors; and
22
•
other companies may design around the technologies patented by us.

Our financial results may be adversely impacted if our products or services are found to infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others.
From time to time, third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights. Litigation may be necessary to defend against any such claims of infringement asserted against us. In addition, it may be necessary to participate in proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the European Patent Office or other foreign patent offices to determine the priority of inventions, which could result in substantial costs. Acquisitions by us of products, technologies or processes that are found to infringe upon others’ intellectual property rights could further increase the risk of litigation or other proceedings and related costs.
The enforcement, defense and prosecution of intellectual property rights involve complex legal and factual questions. As a result, these proceedings are costly and time-consuming, and their outcome is uncertain. 
Changes in our credit ratings or macroeconomic impacts on credit markets may increase our cost of capital and limit financing options.
We utilize short and long-term debt markets to obtain capital from time to time. Our continued access to sources of liquidity depends on multiple factors, including global economic conditions, the condition of global credit markets, the availability of sufficient amounts of financing, operating performance, and credit ratings. Macroeconomic impacts, including natural disasters, pandemics, geopolitical conditions or other catastrophic events, may result in significant disruption in the credit markets, which may adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt or obtain additional financing to support operations or to fund new acquisitions or capital-intensive internal initiatives. 
Any adverse changes in our credit ratings may result in increased borrowing costs for future long-term debt or short-term borrowing facilities which may in turn limit financing options, including access to the unsecured borrowing market. There is no guarantee that additional debt financing will be available in the future to fund obligations, or that it will be available on commercially reasonable terms, in which case we may need to seek other sources of funding. 
Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our debt or contractual obligations.
We now have and expect to continue to have a significant amount of debt. Our indebtedness could have important consequences to us including the following:
•
making it more difficult or even impossible for us to satisfy our debt or contractual obligations;
•
exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities, are at variable rates of interest;
•
restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;
•
requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, which would reduce the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;
•
limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, future business opportunities and the industry in which we operate;
•
placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to any of our less leveraged competitors;
•
increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business and both general and industry-specific adverse economic conditions; and
•
limiting our ability to obtain additional financing, which could worsen if any adverse changes in our credit ratings occur.
We have debt securities outstanding of approximately $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2024. We also can incur up to $700 million of indebtedness under the multi-currency revolving credit facility (“2023 Credit Facility”), as discussed below, and may incur significantly more indebtedness in the future. Our credit facilities contain restrictive covenants, including some which require that we maintain certain ratios, that could limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. We may need to reduce the amount of our indebtedness outstanding from time to time to comply with the ratios 
23
required by such covenants, although no assurance can be given that we will be able to do so. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debt, which could adversely affect our business, earnings and financial condition. Such failure to comply with covenants may also hurt our reputation and credibility with our stockholders and our debt holders and may compromise our future ability to finance our operations through the public equity or debt markets.
 There is no guarantee that we will be able to renew or replace our existing debt agreements as they become due, including debt instruments with principal of $128 million maturing in December 2025. A failure to renew or replace such agreements and instruments would harm our overall liquidity.
Our foreign currency hedging and cash management transactions may be ineffective or only partially mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, exposing us to unexpected volatility.
Due to the global nature of our business, movements in foreign exchange rates may impact our consolidated statements of operations, consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statement of cash flows. With approximately two-thirds of our sales located outside the United States, our consolidated net sales are impacted negatively by the strengthening and positively by the weakening of the U.S. dollar as compared to certain foreign currencies. Additionally, movements in certain foreign exchange rates may impact our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity since a number of our manufacturing and distribution operations are located outside of the United States. Although we currently use and may in the future use certain financial instruments to attempt to mitigate market fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective or available. 
We use foreign currency exchange forward contracts to reduce the effects of exchange rate fluctuations. Should our counterparties to such transactions or the sponsors of the exchanges through which these transactions are offered fail to honor their obligations, we would be exposed to potential losses or the inability to recover anticipated gains from these transactions.
We enter into interest rate swap agreements from time to time to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility. These swap agreements involve risks, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements. In addition, these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to changes in interest rates. If such events occur, our results of operations may be adversely affected.
Most of our cash deposited with banks is not insured and would be subject to the risk of bank failure. Our total liquidity also depends in part on the availability of funds under our 2023 Credit Facility. The failure of any bank in which we deposit our funds or that is part of our 2023 Credit Facility could reduce the amount of cash we have available.
RISKS RELATED TO OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS
Due to the global nature of our business, including increasing exposure to markets outside of the United States, political or economic changes or other factors could harm our business and financial performance.
Approximately two-thirds of our sales are in regions outside the United States, and we anticipate that sales outside of the United States will continue to increase. Operating internationally is subject to uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those related to, the following:
•
economic and political instability;
•
import or export licensing requirements;
•
compliance-related risks;
•
trade restrictions and tariffs;
•
product registration requirements;
•
longer payment cycles;
•
changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs, including restrictions in China on the proportion of certain medical equipment which can be imported;
•
potentially adverse tax consequences; and
•
trade policy changes.
Changes in or the imposition of tariffs, including the tariffs imposed or proposed by the Trump Administration in early 2025 and retaliatory tariffs imposed or proposed by other countries, could make it significantly more difficult or costly for us to export our products to other countries. In particular, these tariffs currently affect some of the components of our products we 
24
import from China and other countries, and we may be required to raise our prices on those products due to these tariffs or share the cost of such tariffs with our customers, which could harm our operating performance. We monitor and evaluate the potential impact of the effective and proposed tariffs as well as other recent changes in foreign trade policy on our supply chain, costs, sales and profitability, and we seek to implement strategies to mitigate such impact, including reviewing sourcing options and working with our vendors and merchants to seek to minimize products coming from China and other countries, both for existing products and for new product development, and we seek to select suppliers in low cost regions where tariff issues are less challenging. These measures could also result in increased costs for goods imported into the United States, supply chain inefficiencies and decreased availability of certain materials with respect to other countries. This could require us to increase prices to our customers, which may reduce demand. If we are unable to increase prices at a sufficient level to offset tariffs, we would be required to lower our margin on products sold. We cannot predict what additional actions may ultimately be taken by the United States or other governments with respect to tariffs or trade relations, what products may be subject to such actions (including subject to United States export control restrictions), or what actions may be taken by other countries in retaliation. The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, the occurrence of a trade war, or other governmental action related to trade policies has the potential to impact demand for our products, our costs, our customers and our suppliers, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Specifically, the Chinese government has implemented a volume-based procurement process designed to decrease prices for medical devices and other products, which has in the past resulted in, and could in the future result in, reduced margins on covered devices and products, required renegotiation of distributor arrangements, or an incurrence of inventory-related charges. For further information, see Part 1. Item 1, “Business - Regulation.” We cannot predict future impacts of the volume-based procurement program on our business, including any expansion of the program to include additional products within our portfolio.
Certain of these risks may be heightened because of changing political climates. For example, due to the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, various countries and international organizations have imposed sanctions on Russia, including its major financial institutions and certain other businesses and individuals, Belarus, the Crimea Region of Ukraine, the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic, and the so-called Luhansk People’s Republic. Russia also imposed currency control measures aimed at restricting the outflow of foreign currency and capital from Russia, imposed restrictions on transacting with non-Russian parties, banned exports of various products, and imposed other restrictions, including reducing the ability of companies to

remit cash from their Russian-based operations to locations outside of Russia. Beginning in September 2024, as a result of further restrictions by European financial institutions on receiving payments from Russia, our capacity to receive intercompany payments for the delivery of our products into Russia has been partially reduced, which further limits our ability to use cash received from sales in Russia for our general purposes. The continuation of the conflict may result in additional sanctions being imposed on Russia and related individuals and entities, with Russia potentially responding in kind. The length, impact, and outcome of this ongoing military conflict is highly unpredictable and could lead to significant market and other disruptions, which, along with the spillover effect of ongoing civil, political, and economic disturbances on surrounding areas, may significantly devalue currencies we use or have other adverse impacts, including increased costs of raw materials, manufacturing or shipping delays or increases in inflation rate, cyberattacks and supply chain challenges. Export controls implemented as part of sanctions could also restrict the sale of products containing U.S.-developed software and technology into Russia. 
For the year ended December 31, 2024, net sales in Russia and Ukraine were approximately 2% of our consolidated net sales, and net assets in these countries were $64 million. These net assets include $39 million of cash and cash equivalents held within Russia as of December 31, 2024, as well as inventory and trade accounts receivable. A significant escalation or expansion of economic disruption could interrupt our supply chain, broaden inflationary costs, impair our assets located in Russia, result in a loss of sales, and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
25
The terrorist attacks by Hamas militants crossing the border from Gaza to Israel in October 2023 and the subsequent military response by the Israeli government in Gaza has resulted in significant unrest within that region. During 2024, the state of Israel has also been a target of coordinated missile and drone attacks launched by the Republic of Iran and its proxies. 
In January 2025, a cease-fire agreement was signed between Hamas and the Israeli government; however, its potential to lead to a long-term peace deal or greater stability remains uncertain. A potential resumption of violence or the involvement of other terrorist groups or foreign powers in the region could impact our employees and operations in future periods. 
Additionally, in May 2024, in response to ongoing military actions, the government of Turkey implemented restrictions on the import of goods manufactured within Israel for sale in the Turkish market. Sales of our products made in Israel and sold in Turkey represent approximately 1% of our global sales of Implant & Prosthetic Solutions reporting unit, but this product category is an area of relatively high potential growth. It is not clear when these restrictions will be lifted or if other countries will institute similar restrictions.
Our operations in Israel consist of two manufacturing facilities for implant products, with one site in northern Israel and one in southern Israel, which together employ approximately 350 associates. These facilities continue to operate. We could face future production slowdowns or closures due to the impacts of the war, including having employees called to active military duty, or due to other resource constraints, such as the inability to source materials for production. 
For the year ended December 31, 2024, net sales of products produced at these sites comprised approximately 3% of our consolidated net sales and 13% of the net sales attributed to our Orthodontic and Implant Solutions segment. Net assets within Israel totaled $180 million as of December 31, 2024, consisting primarily of acquired technology, property, plant and equipment, cash and inventory associated with our operations in country. Our operations in Israel have not been materially impacted by the conflict, and consequently, we have not recorded any allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory reserves, or fixed asset impairments through the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company continues to monitor developments and prepare contingency plans to limit potential disruptions.
Additionally, we sell products from across our portfolio to distributors and dental practices within Israel and its neighbors which may face reduced patient traffic and demand for our products in the near term. Net sales for products sold to our customers in Israel comprised approximately 1% of our consolidated net sales for the year ended 
December 31, 2024
.
While Israel does not constitute a material portion of our business, a significant escalation or expansion of the conflict could result in loss of sales and market position, disrupt our supply chain, broaden inflationary costs including energy prices, and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Additionally, other events, such as the outbreak of a global pandemic or other adverse public health developments could materially affect our business in a number of ways, including:
•
reduced demand for our products in certain regions or our inability to timely meet our customer’s orders, 
•
the failure of third parties to meet their obligations to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, and 
•
uncertainty in the global financial markets. 
RISKS RELATED TO OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS
Management previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, some of which resulted in errors in previously issued financial statements, which have been remediated as of December 31, 2023. If we experience additional material weaknesses in the future, we may be unable to accurately and timely report financial results or comply with the requirements for public companies, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline or limit our access to the capital markets.
A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In 2022 and 2023, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, some of which resulted in errors in previously issued financial statements. These material weaknesses were all remediated as of December 31, 2023.
Although we devote substantial resources to prevent material weaknesses from occurring, it cannot be assured that our measures will be sufficient. Accordingly, there is a reasonable possibility that a reoccurrence of the material weaknesses previously identified or the occurrence of other material weaknesses or deficiencies identified in the future could result in a 
26
material misstatement of our financial statements, potentially causing us to fail to meet our obligations under securities laws, stock exchange listing rules, or debt instrument covenants to file periodic financial reports on a timely basis. Any material weaknesses identified in the future could adversely affect investor confidence in our financial statements, cause the price of our common stock to decline, or limit our access to the capital markets.
Lack of global standardized processes could result in control deficiencies and adversely impact management’s assertions and financial reporting.
We currently use disparate systems, including Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) systems, across the organization, which may reduce our ability to obtain and analyze business data in a timely manner, increase costs for system upgrades, and pose business partner connection challenges. Non-standardized processes may lead to inaccurate, incomplete or delayed financial and management reporting, which may result in misleading or inaccurate reporting for key business decisions or noncompliance with applicable business and regulatory requirements, potentially causing penalties or fines. We continue to focus on standardizing our processes, improving our financial systems, maintaining effective internal controls and centralizing transaction management and execution to provide continued assurance with respect to our financial reports and prevent financial misstatement or fraud. In 2024, we continued implementing a new global ERP system, which will upgrade and standardize our existing information systems. However, this new system will take several years and require significant resources to implement, and may not be fully successful in providing standardization sufficient to address these risks even once completed. 
RISKS RELATED TO OUR REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS
We may be subject to additional litigation and regulatory examinations, investigations, proceedings or court orders relating to the completed 2022 internal investigation regarding certain financial reporting matters. If any of these items are resolved adversely to us, it could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
As a result of the previously reported material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting which were remediated as of December 31, 2023, which partially arose from the independent investigation regarding certain financial reporting matters conducted by the Audit and Finance Committee (“AFC”) of the Company’s Board of Directors. Several securities class action lawsuits were filed against us following our announcement on May 10, 2022 of the AFC’s internal investigation. We may face additional litigation and regulatory examinations, investigations, proceedings or court orders, including additional cease and desist orders, the suspension of trading of our securities, delisting of our securities, the assessment of civil monetary penalties and other equitable remedies. Our management has devoted and may be required to further devote significant time and attention to these matters. If any of these matters are resolved against us, it could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, while we cannot estimate our potential exposure to these matters at this time, we have already expended a significant amount of time and resources investigating and defending against the claims underlying these matters and expect to continue to do so. Accordingly, the ongoing SEC investigation and any related litigation could distract management and entail risks and uncertainties, the outcome of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our reputation. For further information, see Note 21, Commitments and Contingencies, discussing the securities class action lawsuits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
We may be unable to obtain necessary product approvals and marketing clearances.
We must obtain certain approvals and marketing clearances from, governmental authorities, including the FDA and similar health authorities in foreign countries to market and sell select products in those countries. These agencies regulate the marketing, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, advertising, sales and distribution of medical devices. The FDA enforces additional regulations regarding the safety of X-ray emitting devices. Various U.S. states also impose manufacturing, licensing, and distribution regulations.
The FDA review process for new medical devices typically requires extended proceedings pertaining to the safety and efficacy of new products. A 510(k) application is required to market certain classes of new or modified medical devices. If specifically required by the FDA, a pre-market approval, or PMA, may be necessary. Such proceedings are potentially expensive and time consuming and may hinder a product’s entry into the marketplace. Moreover, there can be no assurance that the review or approval process for these products by the FDA or any other governmental authority will occur in a timely fashion, if at all, or that additional regulations will not be adopted or current regulations amended in a manner that will adversely affect us. The FDA also oversees the content of advertising and marketing materials relating to medical devices that received FDA clearance. Failure to comply with the FDA’s advertising guidelines may result in the imposition of penalties, enforcement actions, or import bans, and other negative consequences.
27
We are also subject to other federal, state, and local laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, and to laboratory and manufacturing practices. The extent of government regulation that might result from any future legislation or administrative action cannot be accurately predicted, and inadequate employee training may result in the failure to adhere to applicable laws, rules, and regulations.
Similar to the FDA review process, the EU review process typically requires extended proceedings on the safety and efficacy of new products. Such proceedings are potentially expensive and time consuming and may hinder a product’s entry into the marketplace.
Our products that fall into the category of Class I under the EU MDD were mandated to be certified under the EU MDR. These regulations applied to all medical device manufacturers who market their medical devices in the EU, and manufacturers were required to perform significant upgrades to quality systems and processes On March 20, 2023, the EU Commission extended the MDR transitional periods until December 31, 2027 for higher risk devices and until December 31, 2028 for other medical devices. We remain focused on ensuring that all our medical device products will be fully certified by the deadlines. Additionally, given the exit of the UK from the EU, the EU CE marking will be recognized in the UK through the earlier of the expiration of the product’s CE certificate or June 2028. After such date, the UK may impose its own differing regulatory requirements for products imported from the EU.
Failure to comply with these rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars, and orders could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs, including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs, and could have a material adverse impact on our business. Also, these regulations may be interpreted in a manner that requires us to make changes in operations or incur substantial defense expenses. Even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private regulators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs.
Changes in tax rules or interpretations of tax rules, operating structures, transfer pricing regulations, country profitability mix and regulations and tax investigations, audits or other proceedings that we are subject to may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations, including by adversely affecting our effective tax rate.
As a company with global operations, we are subject to income and non-income-based taxes around the world. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide tax liabilities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable at the time made, the actual outcome could differ materially from the amounts recorded in our financial statements. The Company has significant tax positions in a variety of countries including the United States and Germany. If the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or other tax authorities disagree with our tax positions, we could have additional tax liability, which may have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and regulations, and changes in interpretations of tax laws. 
Certain governments are considering, and may adopt, tax reform measures that could significantly increase our worldwide tax liabilities. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) and other government bodies have focused on the taxation of multi-national corporations, including in the area of “base erosion and profit shifting,” where payments are made from affiliates in jurisdictions with high tax rates to affiliates in jurisdictions with lower rates. Some of these proposals include a two-pillar approach to global taxation, focusing on global profit allocation and a global minimum tax rate (“Pillar Two”). On December 12, 2022, the European Union member states agreed to implement the OECD’s global corporate minimum tax rate of 15%, which became effective as of January 2024. Other countries have made, or are actively considering, changes to their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the OECD’s proposals. Due to the large scale of our global business activities, the enactment of Pillar Two legislation could increase tax uncertainty and have a material effect on the Company’s effective tax rate, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 
The Company will continue to monitor and reflect the impact of such legislative changes in future financial statements as appropriate.
German tax authorities are currently performing a criminal investigation related to a series of intercompany loans from 2016 and 2017 (the “German Tax Investigation”). As of the date of this filing, there have been no charges against the Company or current or former employees. Potential outcomes of the German Tax Investigation involve a number of uncertainties, including those relating to the application of tax law and regulations, and there can be no assurance that the German Tax Investigation will be resolved favorably. Our management has devoted and may be required to further devote significant time 
28
and attention to the German Tax Investigation. If the German Tax Investigation is resolved against us, it could harm our reputation, business, ability to attract talent, particularly professionals with backgrounds in international tax and tax accounting, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, while we cannot estimate our potential exposure at this time, we have already expended a significant amount of time and resources investigating and supporting requests for information from German tax authorities, and we expect to continue to do so. Accordingly, this investigation and any related litigation could distract management and entail risks and uncertainties, the outcome of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our reputation. For further information regarding the German Tax Investigation, see Note 21, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 
We voluntarily suspended the sale and marketing of our direct-to-consumer Byte aligner systems and impression kits, and subsequently determined to cease offering these aligners to new patients while repurposing Byte technologies and capabilities to support other products within our aligner portfolio. As a result, we have experienced a material impact on our results of operations, and we may be required to take additional significant impairment charges if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to reposition Byte.
On October 24, 2024, we announced the voluntary suspension of the sale and marketing of our direct-to-consumer Byte aligner systems and impression kits. In January 2025, we announced that Byte aligners would no longer be offered to new patients, and we now plan to utilize certain Byte resources elsewhere in the aligners portfolio to create orthodontic demand, support a digital clinical workflow, enhance the customer experience, and improve patient monitoring.
The initial suspension and subsequent decisions regarding Byte products has had a material impact on our results of operations. The sales of Byte aligner systems and impression kits represented approximately 3% of our annual revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024, and the assets related to the Byte aligner business are approximately 1% of the Company’s assets as of December 31, 2024. We also incurred charges relating to customer refunds and asset write-offs. For further information, see Note 18, Restructuring and Other Costs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
There is no guarantee that we will be successful in our endeavor to leverage Byte technologies and capabilities in a manner that is accretive to sales and profit. If we are unsuccessful in these efforts, we may be required to incur additional significant impairment charges.
In addition, although we have not accepted any new patients since October 24, 2024, we will continue to provide support for non-contraindicated Byte aligner patients currently undergoing treatment. With respect to these patients, we continue to experience regulatory uncertainties. For example, some state legislatures have passed legislation and other state legislatures have proposed legislation designed to preclude or significantly limit teledentistry, and various state legislatures are continuing to consider such legislation. Furthermore, our ability to conduct business in each state is dependent, in part, upon that state dental board’s regulation of the practice of dentistry. Some state dental boards established rules in a manner that purports to limit or restrict our Byte business, which currently focuses on the provision of Byte aligners to certain existing patients. It is possible that the laws, rules and regulations governing the practice of dentistry and orthodontics in one or more states may change or be interpreted in a manner unfavorable to our business. If adverse laws or regulations are adopted or any such claims are successful, and we were unable to adapt our business model accordingly, our current operations in such states would be disrupted, which could have a
 material adverse effect o
n our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Inadequate levels of reimbursement from governmental or other third-party payors for procedures using our products may cause our revenue to decline.
Third-party payors, including government health administration authorities, private health care insurers and other organizations, regulate the reimbursement of fees related to certain diagnostic procedures or medical treatments. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. While we cannot predict what effect the policies of government entities and other third-party payors will have on future sales of our products, there can be no assurance that such policies would not cause our revenue to decline.
29
Challenges may be asserted against our products due to real or perceived quality, health or environmental issues.
We manufacture and sell a wide portfolio of dental and medical device products. While we endeavor to ensure that our products are safe and effective, there may be challenges from time to time regarding the quality, health or environmental impact of our products or certain raw material components. Adverse publicity about the quality or safety of our products may have an adverse effect on our brand, reputation and operating results. Legal and regulatory developments in this area may lead to litigation and/or product limitations or discontinuation.
We manufacture and sell dental filling materials that may contain bisphenol-A, commonly called BPA. BPA is found in many everyday items, such as plastic bottles, foods, detergents, and toys, and may be found in certain dental composite materials or sealants either as a by-product of other ingredients that have degraded, or as a trace material left over from the manufacture of other ingredients used in such composites or sealants. The FDA currently allows the use of BPA in dental materials, medical devices, and food packaging. Nevertheless, public reports and concerns regarding the potential hazards of BPA could contribute to a perceived safety risk for our products that contain BPA or other substances. 
If we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to health care fraud, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations, which could adversely affect our business.
We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars, and orders relating to health care fraud (“Healthcare Fraud Laws”). Some of these laws, referred to as “false claims laws,” prohibit the submission, or causing the submission, of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to health care payors and programs. Other laws, referred to as “anti-kickback laws,” prohibit soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering, purchasing, leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering, purchasing or leasing, of items or services that are paid for by health care payors and programs.
The U.S. government has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers and physicians and dentists. Under the reporting and disclosure obligations of the U.S. Physician Payment Sunshine Act and similar Healthcare Fraud Laws, the general public and government officials will be provided with access to detailed information with regard to payments or other transfers of value to certain practitioners (including physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals) by applicable drug and device manufacturers, including us. This information may lead to greater scrutiny, which may result in modifications to established practices and additional costs.
Failure to comply with Healthcare Fraud Laws could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs, including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in governmental health care programs, and could have a material adverse impact on our business. Also, these laws may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses. Even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs. In addition, many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by courts, and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities, increasing compliance risks.
We cannot predict whether changes in Healthcare Fraud Laws, or the interpretation thereof, or changes in our services or practices in response, could adversely affect our business.
30
Our business is subject to extensive, complex, and changing domestic and foreign laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, directives, circulars and orders which, if not complied with, subject us to civil or criminal penalties or other liabilities.
We are subject to extensive domestic and foreign laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars and orders which are administered by various international, federal and state governmental authorities, including, among others, the FDA, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“OFAC”), the Bureau of Industry and Security of the U.S. Department of Commerce (“BIS”), the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), and other similar domestic and foreign authorities. These laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars and orders include, but are not limited to, the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the EU MDD (and implementing and local measures adopted thereunder), the Federal Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH Act”), the Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), France’s Data Protection Act of 1978 (rev. 2004), the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”), the U.S. Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and similar international anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, regulations concerning the supply of conflict minerals, various and increasingly fragmented environmental regulations, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (the “Health Care Reform Law”), regulations relating to trade, import and export controls and economic sanctions, and regulations relating to cybersecurity, including the EU’s Network and Information Security Directives, the EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act, and China’s Personal Information Protection Law. Such laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars and orders (“Applicable Laws”) are complex and are subject to change. 
The FCPA generally prohibits companies and their affiliates from making improper payment to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and also includes books and records and internal accounting controls requirements. Our internal policies, procedures and Code of Ethics and Business Conduct mandate compliance with these anti-corruption laws. However, we operate in some countries known to experience corruption. Despite our training and compliance programs, we cannot provide assurance that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of such anti-corruption laws committed by our employees or affiliated entities or their respective officers, directors, employees and agents. Failure to comply with the FCPA and other laws governing the conduct of business with government entities, may subject us to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Any ongoing investigation of potential violations of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws by the United States or foreign authorities could harm our reputation and have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Compliance with numerous applicable existing and new Applicable Laws could require us to incur substantial regulatory compliance costs. For example, we are currently in the process of implementing enhancements to our post-market surveillance processes and reportability criteria, which has resulted in an increase in the number of regulatory reports that we have filed, including retrospective reports, for complaints regarding medical devices. There can be no assurance that governmental authorities will not raise compliance concerns or perform audits to confirm compliance with such Applicable Laws. For example, most of our products are classified as medical devices or pharmaceuticals, which are subject to extensive regulations globally, including the requirement to obtain licenses for the manufacture or distribution of such products. Failure to comply with Applicable Laws could result in a range of governmental enforcement actions, including fines or penalties, injunctions and/or criminal or other civil proceedings. Any such actions could result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.

RISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK
The market price for our common stock may continue to be volatile as a result of a number of factors, including our quarterly operating results.
We may experience significant fluctuations in quarterly sales and earnings due to several factors, some of which are substantially outside of our control, including but not limited to:
•
general economic conditions, as well as those specific to the healthcare industry and related industries;
•
changes in income tax laws and incentives that could create adverse tax consequences;
•
the execution of restructuring plans;
•
the complexity of our organization;
•
our ability to supply products to meet customer demand;
•
the timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors;
•
the timing of industry trade shows;
•
changes in customer inventory levels;
•
developments in government or third-party payor reimbursement policies;
•
changes in customer preferences and product mix;
•
fluctuations in manufacturing costs;
•
competitors’ sales promotions; and
•
fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
As a result, we may fail to meet the expectations of investors and securities analysts, which could cause our stock price to decline.
Certain provisions in our governing documents, and of Delaware law, may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us.
Certain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws and of Delaware law could have the effect of making it difficult for a third party to acquire a controlling interest in us. Such provisions include, among others, a provision allowing the Board of Directors to issue preferred stock having rights senior to those of our common stock and certain requirements which make it difficult for stockholders to amend our By-laws and prevent them from calling special meetings of stockholders. Delaware law imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any “interested stockholder” with beneficial ownership of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock.
GENERAL RISKS
Our business may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions, including inflation, rising interest rates, and supply chain shortages.
Our business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions, including inflation, supply chain disruptions, credit market conditions, consumer and business confidence, and other factors generally beyond our control. We expect the current global supply chain and labor market challenges and inflationary pressures will continue to negatively affect our results of operations. Specifically, the Company continues to experience higher prices and supply chain disruptions for certain raw materials, particularly electronic components, and wage inflation. Certain dental specialty products, dental equipment and related products that support discretionary dental procedures, especially elective procedures in implants and aligners, may also be especially susceptible to changes in economic conditions. Decreases in consumer discretionary spending could negatively affect our business and cause a decline in sales and financial performance.
Additionally, high interest rates have created financial market volatility, which could further negatively impact financial markets or lead to an economic downturn. These and other unfavorable economic conditions could increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or cause lenders not to extend credit to us. Tightening of credit in financial markets has adversely impacted our customers’ and suppliers’ ability to obtain financing and could result in additional impacts in the future, including a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services, inability of customers to make payments, and increased risk of supplier financial distress. 
The Company has sought to offset the elevated costs resulting from raw material cost inflation with annual price increases but has been only partially successful. Should the higher inflationary environment continue, we may not be able to increase the 
32
prices of our offerings sufficiently to keep up with the rate of inflation. Any of the above factors could individually or in combination have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
Talent gaps and failure to manage and retain top talent may impact our ability to manage our operations, execute strategic initiatives and grow our business.
Our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage our human capital through talent acquisition, engagement, development, and retention. To achieve our strategic initiatives, we need to attract, manage, and retain employees with the right skills, competencies, and experiences to execute our strategy and support the growth of the business. The failure to attract and retain such employees to fill key roles, or to upskill employees to fill any potential skill gaps, may adversely affect our business performance, competitive position, and future prospects. We also must retain a pipeline of team members to provide for continuity of succession for senior executive positions. To attract and retain qualified employees, we must offer competitive compensation and benefits and effectively manage employee performance and development. Leadership transitions or other senior management changes may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain talent. Our inability to attract and retain talent may negatively impact business continuity, new product launches, and innovation initiatives. Further, such organizational challenges may make it difficult to maintain our culture, resulting in employees not adhering to the desired values of the organization.
We face the inherent risk of legal actions, including litigation, product liability claims, and other regulatory or compliance matters.
We face the inherent risk of legal actions or claims, including purported securities class actions, investigations by governmental agencies, product liability claims, product recall actions, antitrust suits, customs proceedings, tax actions, commercial or contractual claims, employee benefit or discrimination lawsuits, actions based in environmental laws, and other matters. These actions or claims, regardless of their factual bases, might result in substantial costs, restrictions, or otherwise materially injure our business by harming our reputation or distracting our officers, management, and employees. The penalties imposed as a result of legal actions or claims might include fines, civil penalties, criminal penalties, injunctions, recalls, and other sanctions that may materially harm our business by reducing our ability to sell or promote our products or reducing our profits. We have insurance policies, including directors’ and officers’ insurance and product liability insurance, covering these risks in amounts that are considered adequate; however, we cannot provide assurance that the maintained coverage is sufficient to cover future claims or that the coverage will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost. Also, other types of claims asserted against us may not be covered by insurance. A successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance, or another type of claim which is uninsured or that results in significant adverse publicity against us, could harm our business and our overall cash flows.
Additionally, we include warranties on select products against defects in materials and workmanship, which are generally for a period of one year from the date of shipment or installation plus any extended warranty period purchased by the customer. The future costs associated with providing product warranties could be material. Successful product warranty claims brought against us could reduce our profits and/or impair our financial condition and damage our reputation.
Climate change and related natural disasters could negatively impact our business and financial results.
We have sales or operations in approximately 150 countries and our suppliers’ manufacturing facilities are in many locations around the world. While we seek to mitigate our risks associated with climate events, we recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks regardless of where we conduct our businesses. Global climate change is expected to result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with increased intensity and such climate events could disrupt the production and distribution of our products. Current or future insurance arrangements may not provide protection for costs that may arise from such events, particularly if such events are catastrophic in nature or occur in combination. Accordingly, a natural disaster impacting a significant manufacturing or distribution facility, besides potentially adversely impacting operations of key suppliers, has the potential to disrupt our and our customers’ businesses and may cause us to experience work stoppages, project delays, financial losses and additional costs to resume operations, including increased insurance costs or loss of coverage, legal liability and reputational losses. Increasing natural disasters in connection with climate change could also impact our third-party vendors, service providers or other stakeholders, including disruptions in supply chains, information technology or other necessary services for our Company.
33
Expectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations may expose us to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on our business.
Many governments, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) considerations relating to businesses, including climate change, pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. The increased emphasis on ESG matters has resulted in, and may continue to result in, the adoption of laws and regulations, including additional reporting requirements, leading to increased compliance costs, as well as increased scrutiny regarding our ESG activities and disclosures, which may lead to increased litigation. We make statements about our ESG goals and initiatives through our Sustainability Report, our other non-financial reports, information provided on our website, press statements and other communications. Many of the statements in those voluntary disclosures are based on hypothetical expectations, assumptions, and predictions that may or may not be representative of current or actual risks or events or forecasts of expected risks or events, including the costs associated therewith. Responding to these ESG considerations and implementing these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, may require investments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside our control which may not be independently verified. Our disclosure framework may need to be changed from time to time due to evolving standards and practices, which may result in a lack of consistent or meaningful comparative data from period to period. In addition, our interpretation of reporting frameworks or standards may differ from those of others and such frameworks or standards may change over time, either of which could revise our goals or reported progress in achieving such goals. Further, we cannot guarantee that we will achieve our ESG goals and initiatives. 
Increased and varied focus and activism related to ESG may hinder our access to capital, as investors may reconsider their capital investment because of their assessment of our ESG practices. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with our goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to achieve our goals, further our initiatives, adhere to our public statements, comply with ESG laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against us and could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Furthermore, in recent years, “anti-ESG” sentiment has gained momentum across the United States, with several states and the federal government having proposed or enacted anti-ESG policies, legislation or initiatives or issued related legal opinions. The Trump Administration also recently issued an executive order opposing diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”) initiatives in the private sector, which may draw additional attention to companies which provide products and services to the U.S. government. Such anti-ESG and anti-DEI policies, legislation, initiatives, litigation, legal opinions, and scrutiny could result in our facing additional compliance obligations, becoming the subject of investigations, enforcement actions or litigation, or sustaining reputational harm.
Legislation or regulations that potentially impose restrictions, caps, taxes, or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, could adversely affect our operations and financial results. The European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (“CSRD”) requires impacted companies, including multi-national companies with an EU presence, to make extensive sustainability and climate-related disclosure. The state of California has also enacted a series of environmental laws related to climate disclosures with which we are required to comply. Additionally, the SEC adopted climate-related disclosure rules, which would require the Company to make new climate-related disclosures. Subsequently, the SEC voluntarily stayed the implementation of such rules, pending the completion of judicial review by the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, and it is unclear whether and how the final rules will be implemented. Climate-related rules will increase compliance costs and could increase litigation risks related to disclosures made pursuant to the rules, either of which could materially and adversely affect our financial performance.

Item 1C. Cybersecurity
Risk Management and Strategy
The Company maintains a comprehensive process for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats. These include risks relating to disruption of business operations or financial reporting systems, intellectual property theft, exposure to fraud or extortion, harm to employees or customers, violation of privacy laws or other regulatory and compliance lapses, reputational risk, and inability to consistently deliver digital technologies. For more information on the Company’s risks related to cybersecurity, refer to “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Identifying and assessing cybersecurity risk is fully integrated into our overall risk management systems and processes.
 The Company has established a cybersecurity and information security program that includes risk assessment and mitigation through a threat intelligence-driven approach, application controls, and enhanced security with ransomware defense.
 We leverage the standards set by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) Cybersecurity Framework as well as industry best practices to measure our security posture and manage risk. Our security program under this framework utilizes policies, software, training programs and hardware solutions to protect and monitor our environment, including multi-factor authentication on all critical systems, firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, vulnerability and penetration testing and identity management systems.
Our Chief Information Officer (“CIO”), who reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer, oversees the Company’s approach to managing cybersecurity and digital risk. Our CIO also regularly engages with cross-functional teams at the Company and partners with our dedicated technology risk management and privacy teams and collaborates with our internal audit department to review information technology-related internal controls as part of the overall internal controls process. Our information security strategic plan includes the development of a single detection and response team across both the corporate and product information and technology environments.
We periodically conduct risk assessments to identify threats and vulnerabilities, and then determine the likelihood and impact for each risk using a qualitative risk assessment methodology. We identify risks from various sources, including vulnerability scans, penetration tests, vendor risk assessments, product and services audits, internal compliance assessments and threat-hunting operations. We monitor our infrastructure and applications to identify evolving cyber threats, scan for vulnerabilities and mitigate risks.
With oversight from our Board of Directors, the Company has formally adopted and annually updates a Security Incident Response Plan which coordinates the activities we undertake to prepare for, detect, respond to and recover from cybersecurity incidents. These activities include processes to triage, assess the severity of, escalate, contain, investigate, and remediate incidents, as well as to comply with potentially applicable legal obligations and mitigate brand and reputational damage. Our incident response plan establishes a framework for measuring the severity of security incidents and provides for a post-market response program including protocols for coordination and communication between security response teams, designated leaders within the Company, internal and outside legal counsel, and the Audit and Finance Committee (“AFC”) of the Company’s Board of Directors in responding to any such incidents.
Our cybersecurity and information security program also includes review and assessment by external, independent third parties, with whom we periodically consult on threat assessments and security enhancements, and incident response preparedness.
 We share threat intelligence and collaborate with organizations across different industries to share best practices, fight cybercrime, enhance privacy, discuss new technologies, better understand the evolving regulatory environment, and advance capabilities in these areas. 
Additionally, the Company uses a third-party risk management program that assesses risks from vendors and suppliers. In response to these assessments, we have developed contingency plans for business continuity if our vendors are subject to a cyberattack that impacts our use of their systems.
35
Our Information Security team conducts annual information security awareness training for employees involved in our systems and processes that handle customer data and audits of our systems and conducts enhanced training for specialized personnel. We also conduct cyber awareness training and simulate responses to cybersecurity incidents and use the findings to improve our practices, procedures, and technologies. The Company provides security awareness education and training for all employees and consultants, conducts monthly internal “phishing” testing and mandatory training for “clickers,” and publishes periodic cybersecurity newsletters to highlight any emerging or urgent security threats. 
Our business strategy, results of operations and financial condition have not been materially affected by risks from cybersecurity threats, including the impact of previous cybersecurity incidents, but we cannot provide assurance that they will not be materially affected in the future by such risks and any future material incidents.
 In the last three years, we have not experienced any material information security breach incidents. The Company maintains cybersecurity insurance, and as part of management oversight we regularly review our policy and levels of coverage based on current risks.
Governance
Management’s Role Managing Risk
The cybersecurity risk management processes described above are managed by our 
CIO
 who reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer.

Our CIO has over 20 years of experience in matters of cybersecurity and information systems including senior roles at other global publicly traded companies in various industries. Our CIO is a member of multiple professional organizations, and holds professional certifications from leading information, compliance, and privacy organizations.
 His in-depth knowledge and experience are instrumental in developing and executing our cybersecurity strategies. Our CIO oversees our governance programs, tests our compliance with standards, remediates known risks, and leads our employee training program.
At the management level, our IT security team regularly monitors alerts and meets to discuss threat levels, trends and remediation, and the CIO is also continually informed about any developments in cybersecurity, including potential threats and industry techniques for risk management to address those threats. The role of the CIO includes implementation and oversight of effective processes to monitor our information systems, including the deployment of advanced security measures and regular system audits to identify potential vulnerabilities. The CIO regularly reports to senior management on our cybersecurity risks and actions taken to mitigate that risk.
Board of Directors Oversight
Our Board of Directors is committed to mitigating data privacy and cybersecurity risks and recognizes the importance of these issues as part of our risk management framework. 
The AFC is charged with oversight of data privacy and cybersecurity risks.

Our CIO provides updates to either the AFC or to the full Board of Directors on a quarterly basis on our cybersecurity risks and actions taken to mitigate that risk.
 These briefings encompass a broad range of topics, including:
•
current cybersecurity landscape and emerging threats;
•
the status of ongoing cybersecurity initiatives and strategies;
•
compliance with regulatory requirements and industry standards; and
•
updates on the Company’s performance preparing for, preventing, detecting, responding to and recovering from cyber incidents. 
The CIO also promptly informs and updates the Company’s Board of Directors about any information security incidents that may pose significant risk to the Company. Our guidelines require that any significant cybersecurity matters including strategic risk management decisions are escalated to the Board of Directors to ensure that they have comprehensive oversight. The AFC conducts an annual review of the Company’s cybersecurity posture and the effectiveness of its risk management strategies. As part of this review, the Company’s cybersecurity program is periodically evaluated by external experts, and the results of those reviews are reported to the Company’s Board of Directors. This review helps in identifying areas for improvement and ensuring the alignment of cybersecurity efforts with the overall risk management framework.
