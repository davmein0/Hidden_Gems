Item 3. Legal Proceedings
The Company is, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation and similar proceedings incidental to our business. These legal matters primarily involve stockholder derivative suits, claims for damages arising out of the use of our products and services and claims relating to intellectual property matters including patent infringement, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes, competition and sales and trading practices, personal injury and insurance coverage. We may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions or as a result of liabilities retained from, or representations, warranties or indemnities provided in connection with, divested businesses. Some of these lawsuits may include claims for punitive and consequential, as well as compensatory damages. Based upon our experience, current information and applicable law, we do not believe that these proceedings and claims will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. However, in the event of unexpected further developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, or other similar matters, if unfavorable, may be materially adverse to our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. For additional details, see Part II, Item 8, Note 21, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated by reference.

Offerings in this segment also include application of our digital services and technology, including those provided by DS Core, our cloud-based platform.
Wellspect Healthcare
This segment includes the design, manufacture, and sales of the Company’s innovative continence care solutions for both urinary and bowel management. This category consists mainly of urology catheters and other healthcare-related consumable products.
Recent Developments
As previously disclosed in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed February 11, 2025, the Company has initiated a process to evaluate strategic alternatives for its Wellspect Healthcare business. There is no deadline or definitive timetable set for completion of the strategic alternatives process or assurance that the process will result in a transaction. The Company does not intend to make further announcements regarding the review of strategic alternatives unless and until the Board of Directors approves a course of action or otherwise determines further disclosure is appropriate or necessary.
The impact of global economic conditions
Markets in several regions, particularly Europe, continue to experience varying degrees of pressures inhibiting growth and face concerns about the systemic impacts of adverse economic conditions and geopolitical events. Changes in economic conditions, supply chain constraints, higher energy costs, labor shortages, the conflict in Ukraine, and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and Russia, have all contributed to a period of higher inflation across the industry and the regions in which the Company operates. As a result, the Company has experienced higher prices for certain raw materials, including electronic components, which have led to a negative impact on margins. We expect a continuation of inflationary pressure on the cost of both raw materials and wages into 2025, the effect of which will depend on our ability to successfully mitigate and offset the related impacts.
The challenging macroeconomic conditions have also negatively impacted demand for the Company’s products and may continue to do so in the future. Specifically, higher interest rates have put pressure on the ability and willingness of our customers to obtain financing for equipment purchases, which adversely affects volumes for these products. The higher cost of borrowing has also reduced patient demand for elective dental procedures, which affects sales of the Company’s offerings more broadly. The Company has also faced additional competitive pressure for lower-priced options for equipment and other products by dental practices, in particular for imaging products and implants. While the Company has taken steps to address competitive pressures, such as the reintroduction of its Orthophos SL 2D and 3D products, these trends may continue. While patient volumes have largely remained stable in the United States, the impact of macroeconomic declines and high interest rates has been particularly a
pparent in Germany, which represented 
11% 
of the Company’s sales for the year ended December 31, 2024. 
Germany was in a recession for most of 2023, largely due to persistent high inflation and falling household spending. Although conditions, including inflation, marginally improved in 2024, demand for investments in new dental equipment continued to be weak, and economic forecasts by the German government project limited growth in 2025. The Company anticipates that the challenging macroeconomic and market conditions in Germany are likely to persist and negatively impact sales of equipment into next year.
In anticipation of a continued inflationary trend and potentially deteriorating macroeconomic environment, we have attempted to mitigate these pressures through the following actions, among others:
•
Driving strategic procurement initiatives to leverage alternative sources of raw materials and transportation;
•
Implementing cost-containment measures, as well as intensifying continuous improvement and restructuring programs in our manufacturing and distribution facilities and other areas of our business, including the most recent restructuring plan approved by the Board of Directors on July 29, 2024; 
•
Optimizing our customer management and implementing strategic investments in our commercial sales organization in key markets, particularly the United States; and
•
Refining our focus on developing a winning portfolio with global scale to maximize market share in a competitive pricing environment.
42
The impact of the Israel-Hamas war
The terrorist attacks by Hamas militants crossing the border from Gaza to Israel in October 2023 and the subsequent military response by the Israeli government in Gaza has resulted in significant unrest and uncertainty within that region. During the course of 2024, the state of Israel has also been a target of coordinated missile and drone attacks launched by the Republic of Iran and by Iran’s terrorist proxy organization in Lebanon. Although a cease-fire agreement was signed between Hamas and the Israeli government in January 2025, the potential for a long-term peace deal and greater stability remains uncertain. A resumption of the violence or the involvement of other terrorist groups or foreign powers in the region could impact our employees and operations in future periods. 
Additionally, in May 2024, in response to ongoing military actions, the government of Turkey implemented restrictions on the import of goods manufactured within Israel for sale in the Turkish market. Sales of our products made in Israel and sold in Turkey have historically represented approximately 1% of our global sales of the Implant & Prosthetic Solutions reporting unit, but this product category is an area of relatively high potential growth. The loss of sales to Turkey in 2024 was partially offset by sales of implants produced outside of Israel. It is not clear when these restrictions will be lifted or if other countries will institute similar restrictions.
The Company’s operations in Israel consist of two manufacturing facilities for implants products, with one site in northern Israel and one site in southern Israel, which together employ approximately 350 associates. These facilities remain open and continue to operate. We may, however, decide to discontinue production at these facilities for the safety of our employees, or we could face future production slowdowns or interruptions at either location due to the impacts of the war, including personnel absences as a number of our employees have been called to active military duty, or due to other resource constraints such as the inability to source materials for production. 
For the year ended December 31, 2024, net sales of products produced at these sites comprised approximately 
3% o
f our consolidated net sales an
d 13%
 of the
 net sales of the Orthodontic and Implant Solutions segment. Net assets within Israel totaled $180 million as of December 31, 2024, consisting primarily of acquired technology, property, plant and equipment, cash, and inventory associated with our operations in the country. Overall, the Company’s operations in Israel have not been materially impacted by the conflict, and consequently, the Company has not recorded any allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory reserves, or fixed asset impairments for the year ended December 31, 2024 due to the conflict. The Company continues to monitor developments and prepare contingency plans to limit potential disruption to its operations in the future.
Additionally, we sell products from across our portfolio to distributors of dental products and direct to dental practices within Israel and its neighboring countries which may face reduced patient traffic and demand for our products in the near term. Net sales for products sold to our customers in Israel comprised approximately
 1% 
of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2024.
The impact of the war in Ukraine
In February 2022, because of the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, economic sanctions were imposed by the United States, the European Union, and certain other countries on Russian financial institutions and businesses. Due to the medical nature of our products, the current sanctions have not materially restricted our ability to continue selling many of our products to customers located in Russia. The Company also sources certain raw materials and components from Russia and Ukraine and has taken actions to minimize any adverse impacts from disrupted supply chains related to these items. The Company’s operations in Ukraine consist primarily of R&D activities, which continue from locations that focus on the safety of employees. Ov
erall, the Company’s operations in Russia and Ukraine have not been materially impacted by the conflict, and consequently, the Company has not recorded any allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory reserves, or asset impairments for the year ended December 31, 2024 as a result of the conflict.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, net sales in Russia and Ukraine were approximately 2% of our consolidated net sales, and net assets in these countries were $64 million. These net assets include $39 million of cash and cash equivalents held within Russia as of December 31, 2024
, as well as inventory and trade accounts receivable. Due to currency control measures imposed by the Russian government, which include restrictions on the ability of companies to repatriate or otherwise remit cash from their Russian-based operations to locations outside of Russia, we continue to be limited in our ability to transfer this cash balance out of Russia without incurring substantial costs. Additionally, beginning in September 2024, as a result of further restrictions by European financial institutions on receiving payments from Russia, our capacity to receive intercompany payments for the delivery of our products into Russia has been partially reduced, which further limits our ability to use cash received from sales in Russia for our general purposes. It is unclear whether the remaining financial institutions which the Company relies upon for bank transfers from Russia will ultimately be able to continue facilitating payments, or for how long. 
43
If these restrictions on cash transfers from Russia worsen, or if we are not able to obtain long-term relief from these restrictions, we may need to take additional actions, including potential suspension of our business in Russia.
A significant escalation or expansion of the economic disruption from the conflict could interrupt our supply chain, broaden inflationary costs, impair our assets located in Russia, result in a loss of sales, and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
 For additional discussion of associated risks, refer to Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” - Risks Related to Our Global Operations. 
Business Drivers
The primary drivers of organic sales (as defined below) include macroeconomic factors, global dental industry demand, innovation and new product launches by the Company, as well as continued investments in sales and marketing resources to drive demand creation, including clinical education. On a short-term basis, sudden changes in the macroeconomic environment, supply chain challenges, or changes in distributor inventory levels can and have impacted the Company’s sales. Demand can also fluctuate based on the timing of dental trade shows where promotions are offered, major new product introductions, and variability in dental patient traffic, which can be exacerbated by seasonal or severe weather patterns, or other demographic disruptions such as global pandemics.
The Company has a focus on maximizing operational excellence on a global basis. The Company has expanded the use of technology and has undertaken process improvement initiatives to enhance global efficiency. In addition, management continues to evaluate the worldwide consolidation and simplification of operations and functions to further reduce costs. While the Company continues consolidation initiatives, which can have an adverse impact on reported results in the short term, the Company expects that the continued benefits from these global efficiency efforts will improve its cost structure in the long-term. Meanwhile, the Company intends to continue pursuing opportunities to expand the Company’s product and solutions offerings, technologies, and sales and service infrastructure through partnerships. Although the professional dental market has experienced consolidation, it remains fragmented.
The Company’s business is subject to quarterly fluctuations in net sales and operating income. The timing of annual price increases, promotional activities, as well as changes in inventory levels at distributors contribute to this fluctuation. Also, the Company distributes approximately two-thirds of its dental consumable and technology and equipment products through third-party distributors whose inventory levels tend to increase in the period leading up to a price increase and decline in the period following the implementation of a price increase, although these fluctuations are mitigated by limits on purchases ahead of these increases. Changes in distributors’ inventory levels have impacted the Company’s consolidated net sales in the past and may continue to do so in the future. In addition, the Company may from time to time engage in new distributor relationships that could cause fluctuations in consolidated net sales and operating income. Distributor inventory levels may fluctuate and differ from the Company’s projections and market demand, resulting in the Company’s forecast of future results being different than expected. There can be no assurance that the Company’s distributors and customers will maintain levels of inventory or patterns of build and liquidation timing in accordance with the Company’s predictions or history. Any of these fluctuations could be material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements. For more information about the drivers of our business and related risks, see Part I, Item 1, “Business” and Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
Restructuring Programs
On July 29, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an additional plan to restructure the Company’s business to improve operational performance and drive stockholder value creation (the “2024 Plan”). The Company expects to incur between $35 million and $50 million

in non-recurring charges under the 2024 Plan. The Company anticipates that the 2024 Plan will be substantially completed by the end of 2025 and result in $80 million to $100 million in annual cost savings. For details on this plan including the nature of the non-recurring charges incurred during the year, refer to Note 18, Restructuring and Other Costs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, and to the discussion under the heading “Material Trends in Capital Resources” within MD&A.

Impact of Foreign Currencies
Due to the Company’s global footprint, movements in foreign currency exchange rates may have a material impact on its reported net sales and pre-tax income. With approximately two-thirds of the Company’s net sales originating from regions 
44
outside the United States, the Company’s net sales and results of operations are negatively impacted by the strengthening, or positively impacted by the weakening, of the U.S. dollar compared to the primary currencies in which the Company operates.
While the Company employs financial instruments to hedge some of its transactional foreign exchange exposure, these activities do not insulate it completely from those exposures, particularly from the currency exposure arising from translation of non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries. During fiscal year 2024, both net sales and gross profit were adversely impacted due to the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies. The continued strength of the U.S. dollar could continue to adversely impact the Company’s results.
Distribution Arrangements
In July 2024, the Company delivered a one-year notice of non-renewal in connection with its non-exclusive distribution agreements with Patterson Companies, Inc. (“Patterson”) for the distribution of dental equipment in the United States and Canada. It is anticipated that Patterson will continue to be one of the Company’s two largest distributors as a percentage of the Company’s global revenue during the one-year notice period. The Company intends to continue to engage in discussions for new distribution agreements with Patterson. However, failure to successfully renegotiate the distribution agreements or secure potential new agreements with another distributor could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, operating results and financial condition. The Company has not incurred any charges against earnings in 2024 related to non-renewal of the distribution agreements. For additional information, see Part 1, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
Byte Aligners Business
On October 24, 2024, the Company announced the voluntary suspension of the sale and marketing of its Byte aligner system and impression kits while the Company conducted a review of certain regulatory requirements related to these products. The Company’s decision was made in communication with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) and resulted in suspension of the shipment and processing of new and recently placed orders for Byte aligners and impression kits through the remainder of 2024. In January 2025, the Company announced plans that the Byte aligners would no longer be offered to new patients, and the Company now plans to utilize certain Byte resources elsewhere in the aligners portfolio to create orthodontic demand, support a digital clinical workflow, enhance the customer experience, and improve patient monitoring. 
As a result of these developments, in the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company recorded $187 million in impairments of assets pertaining to the Byte business including a trademark, fixed assets, capitalized software and working capital. In addition to these impairments, the Company recorded an accrual for expected customer refund and other reimbursement payments stemming from the cessation of sales and business realignment, which resulted in a $35 million reduction to net sales. The suspension of sales in the fourth quarter of 2024 also resulted in a decline in aligner revenues as compared to the prior period. For additional information refer to Item 8, Note 18, Restructuring and Other Costs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K, as well as the Results of Operations discussion below.

Net Sales and Key Performance Measurements
The Company presents net sales comparing the current year periods to the prior year periods. In addition, the Company also presents the changes in net sales on an organic sales basis, which is a Non-GAAP measure. The Company defines “organic sales” as the reported net sales adjusted for: (1) net sales from acquired and divested businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition or divestiture; (2) net sales attributable to discontinued product lines in both the current and prior year periods; and (3) the impact of foreign currency changes, which is calculated by translating current period net sales using the comparable prior period’s currency exchange rates.
Our measure of organic sales may differ from those used by other companies and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with US GAAP. Organic sales is an important internal measure for the Company, and its senior management receives a monthly analysis of operating results that includes organic sales. The performance of the Company is measured on this metric along with other performance metrics.
45
The Company discloses changes in organic sales to allow investors to evaluate the performance of the Company’s operations exclusive of the items listed above that may impact the comparability of results from period to period and may not be indicative of past or future performance of the normal operations of the Company. The Company believes that this supplemental information is helpful in understanding underlying net sales trends.

The decrease in organic sales for the year was primarily driven by a decrease in volume for implants and prosthetics products across the United States and Europe, and weaker sales of aligners in the United States which were negatively impacted by the suspension of the sale and marketing of Byte aligner system and impression kits. The decrease was partially offset by increased sales of SureSmile aligners in Europe and of implants products in Rest of World.

The decrease in organic sales was primarily due to changes in the operation of our direct-to-consumer aligners business during the course of the year, and particularly during the fourth quarter as described above under the heading “Byte Aligners Business.” Prior to the suspension of sales of aligners and impression kits beginning in October 2024, legislative trends relating to teledentistry in certain states had already prompted us to make adjustments to the Byte business model which resulted in reductions of sales of aligners by approximately $15 million during the first nine months of 2024. The subsequent suspension of sales in October resulted in a decline in revenues relative to the prior year, and we also recorded an estimate of customer refund and other reimbursement payments stemming from these actions which resulted in an additional $35 million reduction to revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024.
In addition to the impact from Byte, the decrease in sales in the United States was also due to lower volumes for consumables products within the Essential Dental Solutions segment, lower volumes for implants and prosthetics products, and lower volumes of products within the Connected Technology Solutions segment. These decreases were partially offset by lower 
47
customer incentives and higher volumes of Wellspect products as a result of new product launches.
Organic sales were also negatively affected by wholesale volumes for CAD/CAM products relative to the year ended December 31, 2023 due in part to timing of distributor orders. Volumes of CAD/CAM units held by distributors at December 31, 2024 decreased $8 million compared to the beginning of 2024, whereas volumes of CAD/CAM inventory held by distributors at December 31, 2023 remained consistent with the beginning of 2023. Volumes of imaging products held by distributors at December 31, 2024 decreased $7 million compared to the beginning of 2024, whereas volumes of imaging products held by distributors at December 31, 2023 increased by $1 million compared to the beginning of 2023. Distributor inventory levels for both CAD/CAM and imaging products remained low as of December 31, 2024 relative to historical averages.

The decrease in organic sales was primarily driven by lower volumes and unfavorable pricing for Connected Technology Solutions products, particularly in Japan, which saw lower volumes due to competitive pressures. These decreases were partially offset by increased volumes for implant and endodontic products, particularly in China. The local volume-based procurement program in China resulted in increased volumes for implants products during 2024, particularly during the first half of the year, with a decline in the second half of the year due to current macroeconomic conditions.

SG&A Expenses
SG&A expenses decreased primarily due to lower headcount costs, lower travel costs, and lower professional service costs. The decrease was also due to lower sales and advertising costs for Byte products after the suspension of sales noted above. The overall decrease in expenses was partially offset by an increase in general and administrative costs within the Orthodontic and Implant Solutions segment, primarily as a result of bad debt expense for the write-off of Byte receivables.
R&D Expenses
R&D expenses decreased compared to the prior year as the Company continues to take a disciplined approach with ongoing investments in digital workflow solutions, product development initiatives, and software development, including the clinical application suite and cloud deployment. The Company expects to continue to maintain a level of investment in R&D that is at least 4% of annual net sales.
Goodwill and Intangible Asset Impairments
Goodwill and intangible asset impairments increased compared to the prior year, due to a higher level of impairment charges, specifically related to the goodwill pertaining to the Implant & Prosthetic Solutions reporting unit, a write-off of the Byte trademark, and certain intangible assets within the Connected Technology Solutions segment. 
For further information, see Item 8, Note 11, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.
Restructuring and Other Costs
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded net expense of $53 million of restructuring costs which consist primarily of charges associated with the restructuring plans announced in February 2023 and July 2024. For further information, see Item 8, Note 18, Restructuring and O

Connected Technology Solutions
The decrease in segment adjusted operating income is due to the lower sales volumes noted above, unfavorable manufacturing leverage from lower volumes, and unfavorable product mix as a result of lower sales for certain higher margin CAD/CAM equipment products. These decreases were partially offset by lower headcount-related costs and product warranty and return costs.
Essential Dental Solutions
 Segment adjusted operating income is flat due to favorable product mix and favorable pricing being offset primarily by the lower volumes noted above.
Orthodontic and Implant Solutions
The decrease in segment adjusted operating income is due to the impact from suspending sales of Byte clear aligners to new customers in October 2024 as previously described, the Byte refunds and inventory write-offs, and higher distribution and manufacturing costs. As noted above, operating income was also unfavorably impacted by a decline in sales for implant and prosthetics products, as well as higher general and administrative costs primarily as a result of bad debt expense for the write-off of Byte receivables, partly offset by lower sales and advertising costs for Byte products.
Wellspect Healthcare
The increase in segment adjusted operating income was driven by the increase in organic sales noted above due to new product launches, as well as margin improvements due to favorable manufacturing leverage from higher volumes.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements. The process of determining significant estimates is fact-specific and, when determining significant estimates, management considers factors such as historical experience, current and expected economic conditions, product mix and in some cases, actuarial techniques. The Company evaluates these significant factors as facts and circumstances dictate. Some events as described below could cause results to differ significantly from those determined using estimates. The Company has identified the following accounting estimates as those which are critical to its business and results of operations.
Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
Assessment of the potential impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets is an integral part of the Company’s normal ongoing review of operations. Testing for potential impairment of these assets is dependent on significant assumptions and reflects management’s best estimates at a particular point in time. The dynamic economic environments in which the Company’s businesses operate and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices, increased competition and introductions of new technologies can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests. Estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results. Changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments, as well as the time at which such impairments are recognized. If there are unfavorable changes in these assumptions, particularly changes in the Company’s discount rates, revenue growth rates, and operating margins, the Company may be required to recognize impairment charges.
The determination of fair value involves uncertainties around the forecasted cash flows as it requires management to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate future business expectations. Those future expectations relate to, among other things, distribution channel changes, impact from competition, and new product developments. The Company also considers the current and projected market and economic conditions for dental and medical device industries, both in the United States and globally, when determining its assumptions. Operating cash flow assumptions may also be impacted by assumptions regarding costs and benefits from restructuring initiatives, tax rates, foreign exchange rates, capital spending and working capital changes.
A change in any of the estimates and assumptions used in the Company’s annual goodwill impairment test as described below or unfavorable changes in the overall markets served by the Company’s reporting units, among other factors, could have a negative material impact to the fair value of the Company’s reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets and could result in a future impairment charge.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess cost over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of business acquired and is allocated among the Company’s reporting units. Goodwill is not amortized; instead, it is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually at April 1 or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired, or if a decision is made to sell a business. Judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred during the year. Such indicators may include a decline in expected cash flows, unanticipated competition, increased interest rates, or slower growth rates, among others. When testing goodwill for impairment, the Company may assess qualitative factors for its reporting units to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill. Alternatively, the Company may bypass this qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. It is important to note that fair values which could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill.
Goodwill is allocated among reporting units and evaluated for impairment at that level. The Company’s reporting units are either an operating segment or one level below its operating segments, as determined in accordance with US GAAP.
52
The quantitative evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its net book value, including goodwill. The Company uses a discounted cash flow model (“DCF model”) as its valuation technique to measure the fair value for its reporting units when testing for impairment, as management believes forecasted operating cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value. The discounted cash flow model uses ten-year forecasted cash flows plus a terminal value based on capitalizing the last period’s cash flows using a perpetual growth rate. The significant assumptions and estimates involved in the application of the DCF model to forecast operating cash flows include, but are not limited to the discount rates, revenue growth rates (including perpetual growth rates), and future operating margin percentages of the reporting unit’s business. These assumptions may vary significantly among the reporting units. Operating cash flow forecasts are based on approved business-unit operating plans for the early years and historical relationships and projections in later years. In the development of the forecasted cash flows, the Company applies revenue, gross profit, and operating expense assumptions taking into consideration historical trends as well as future expectations. The revenue growth rate assumptions were developed in consideration of future expectations which included, but were not limited to, distribution channel changes, impact from competition, and new product developments for these reporting units. Discount rates are estimated for geographic regions and applied to the reporting units located within the regions. These rates are developed based on market participant data, which include assumptions regarding the Company’s weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit’s ability to execute on the projected cash flows. As part of the annual test, the Company reconciled the aggregate fair values of its reporting units to its market capitalization, which included a reasonable control premium based on market conditions. The Company has not materially changed its methodology for goodwill impairment testing for the years presented. 
Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade names, trademarks, and in-process R&D and are not subject to amortization; instead, they are tested for impairment annually at April 1 or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets may be impaired or if a decision is made to discontinue or divest a business. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred during the year. Such indicators may include a decline in expected cash flow, unanticipated competition, increased interest rates, or slower growth rates, among others. It is important to note that fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of indefinite-lived assets.
The fair value of acquired trade names and trademarks is estimated using a relief from royalty method, which values an indefinite-lived intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through the ownership of an asset. Under this method, an owner of an indefinite-lived intangible asset determines the arm’s length royalty that likely would have been charged if the owner had to license the asset from a third party. The royalty rate, which is based on the estimated rate applied against forecasted sales, is tax-effected and discounted at present value using a discount rate commensurate with the relative risk of achieving the cash flow attributable to the asset. Management judgment is necessary to determine key assumptions, including revenue growth rates, perpetual revenue growth rates, royalty rates, and discount rates. Other assumptions are consistent with those applied to goodwill impairment testing. 
Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairment Results
The Company assessed the goodwill of its reporting units and its indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment as of April 1, 2024. Based on the Company's April 1 impairment test, it was determined that the fair values of its reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets more likely than not exceeded their carrying values, resulting in no impairment.
In the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company identified indicators of a more likely than not impairment for two of its reporting units, Orthodontic Aligner Solutions and Implant & Prosthetic Solutions, which together comprise all of the Orthodontic and Implant Solutions segment. As a result, the Company recorded pre-tax goodwill impairment charges as of September 30, 2024 of $145 million for the Orthodontic Aligner Solutions reporting unit and $359 million for the Implant & Prosthetic Solutions reporting unit, both within the Orthodontic and Implant Solutions segment. The charges were recorded in Goodwill and intangible asset impairment in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The impairment charge related to the Orthodontic Aligner Solutions reporting unit resulted in a full write-off of the remaining goodwill balance for this reporting unit. 
53
In the quarter ended December 31, 2024, the Company identified indicators of a more likely than not impairment for its Implant & Prosthetic Solutions reporting unit within the Orthodontic and Implant Solutions segment. The decline in fair value of this reporting unit was driven by a weaker trend in sales volumes, particularly in North America, increased competition from lower-priced alternatives impacting global markets, and adverse macroeconomic pressures impacting demand for elective dental procedures and premium implant solutions. These factors contributed to reduced forecasted revenues, lower operating margins, and reduced expectations for future cash flows. The fair value of the Implant & Prosthetic Solutions reporting unit was computed using a discounted cash flow model with inputs developed using internal projections and market-based data. As a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax goodwill impairment charge as of December 31, 2024 of $269 million for the Implant & Prosthetic Solutions reporting unit within the Orthodontic and Implant Solutions segment. This charge was recorded in Goodwill and intangible asset impairment in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
Additionally, in the quarter ended December 31, 2024, the Company also identified indicators of more likely than not impairments for certain indefinite-lived intangible assets including trade names and trademarks within the Connected Technology Solutions segment, and certain trade names within the Implant & Prosthetic Solutions reporting unit within the Orthodontic and Implant Solutions segment. The decline in fair value of the trade names and trademarks was driven by weakened demand for the Company’s premium equipment and implant products, competitive pricing pressures, and a sustained higher cost of capital, which are contributing to reduced forecasted revenues. These indefinite-lived intangible assets were evaluated for impairment using an income approach, specifically a relief from royalty methodology. As a result, the Company recorded indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $82 million and $1 million for the Connected Technology Solutions and Orthodontic and Implant Solutions segments, respectively, for the three months ended December 31, 2024. These charges were recorded in Goodwill and intangible asset impairment in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
The remaining goodwill balance of the Implant & Prosthetic Solutions reporting unit was $503 million as of December 31, 2024, 
and the carrying values of indefinite-lived intangible assets with impairments in the fourth quarter were $76 million and $149 million for the Implant & Prosthetic Solutions and Connected Technology Solutions reporting units, respectively, as of December 31, 2024. 
As the fair values of the Implant & Prosthetic Solutions reporting unit and the indefinite-lived assets within the Implant & Prosthetic Solutions and Connected Technology Solutions reporting units, respectively, continue to approximate carrying value as of December 31, 2024, any further decline in key assumptions could result in additional impairments in future periods.
Based on quantitative and qualitative analyses performed for the other reporting units and the Company’s other indefinite-lived intangible assets, the Company believes there is no indication that the carrying value more likely than not exceeds the fair value in each case as of December 31, 2024. For the Company's reporting units that were not impaired, the Company applied a hypothetical sensitivity analysis by increasing the discount rate of these reporting units by 50 basis points. The results of this sensitivity analysis at December 31, 2024, indicate that none of the other reporting units would have been impaired.
For further information, see Note 11, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are determined using the liability method of accounting for income taxes. The Company’s tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes plus the provision for U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries not considered to be permanently invested.
The Company applies a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company recognizes in the consolidated financial statements the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position.
Certain items of income and expense are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized in future years. The Company establishes a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which realization is not likely. At December 31, 2024, the Company has a valuation allowance of $1,503 million against the benefit of certain deferred tax assets of foreign and domestic subsidiaries.
The Company’s tax positions are subject to ongoing examinations by the tax authorities. The Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions throughout the world and in the normal course of business is examined by taxing authorities in those jurisdictions. Adjustments to the uncertain tax positions are recorded when taxing authority examinations are completed, 
54
statutes of limitation are closed, changes in tax laws occur or as new information comes to light regarding the technical merits of the tax position.

Cash provided by operating activities increased compared to the prior year primarily as a result of changes in working capital, including higher collections on accounts receivable due largely to timing of customer remittances, decreased inventory levels, and timing of estimated tax payments. These increases in operating cash were offset by other changes in working capital including the timing of payments to vendors compared to the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the number of days for sales outstanding in accounts receivable decreased by 4 days to 55 days at December 31, 2024 as compared to 59 days at December 31, 2023, and the number of days of sales in inventory decreased by 2 days to 124 days at December 31, 2024 as compared to 126 days at December 31, 2023. 
The cash used in investing activities increased compared to the prior year primarily due to higher capital expenditures of $31 million, lower net cash proceeds on settlement of derivatives of $38 million, and in the prior year, the Company’s sale of a minority interest investment resulted in proceeds of $13 million. For the year ended December 31, 2023, capital expenditures were $149 million, and for the year ended December 31, 2024, capital expenditures were $180 million. The Company estimates capital expenditures to be in the range of appr
oximately $160 million to $190 million for
 the twelve months ending December 31, 2025 and expects these investments to include expenses for the ongoing implementation of a new global Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) system, equipment upgrades, and capacity expansion to support product innovation and consolidate operations for enhanced efficiencies. 
The decrease of cash used in financing activities compared to the prior year was primarily driven by an increase in net borrowings of $51 million on short-term debt compared to the prior year and a decrease in cash paid on share repurchases of $50 million compared to the prior year. The decrease of cash used in financing activities was mostly offset by an increase of $10 million in dividends paid compared to the prior year and an increase of $81 million in payments on long-term borrowings compared to the prior year. The Company’s total borrowings increased by a net $17 million during the year ended December 31, 2024. 
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company repurchased approximately 9.4 million shares under its open market share repurchase plan for a cost of $250 million at a volume-weighted average price of $26.65. On November 7, 2023, the Board of Directors approved an increase to the authorized share repurchase program of $1.0 billion. At December 31, 2024, $1.2 billion of authorization remains available for future share repurchases. Additional share repurchases, if any, may be made through open market purchases, Rule 10b5-1 plans, accelerated share repurchases, privately negotiated transactions, or other transactions in such amounts and at such times as the Company considers appropriate based upon prevailing market and business conditions and other factors. At December 31, 2024, the Company held 65.7 million shares of treasury stock.

At December 31, 2024, the Company had $313 million of borrowings available under lines of credit, including lines available under its short-term arrangements and revolving credit facility. The Company’s borrowing capacity includes a $700 million multi-currency revolving credit facility which expires in May 2028. The Company also has access to an aggregate $700 million under a U.S. dollar commercial paper facility, which was expanded in December 2024 from its previous capacity of $500 million. The $700 million revolver serves as a back-up to the commercial paper facility, thus the total available credit under the commercial paper facility and the multi-currency revolving credit facility in the aggregate is $700 million. The Company had $410 million outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper facility at December 31, 2024 resulting in $290 million remaining available under the revolving credit and commercial paper facilities. The Company also has access to $34 million in uncommitted short-term financing under lines of credit from various financial institutions, the availability of which is reduced by other short-term borrowings. The lines of credit have no major restrictions and are provided under demand notes between the Company and the lending institutions. At December 31, 2024, the Company has $11 million outstanding under these short-term borrowing arrangements. 
The Company’s revolving credit facility, term loans and senior notes contain certain covenants relating to the Company’s operations and financial condition. The most restrictive of these covenants are: (1) a ratio of total debt outstanding to total capital not to exceed 0.6, and (2) a ratio of operating income excluding depreciation and amortization to interest expense of not less than 3.0 times, in each case, as such terms are defined in the relevant agreement. Any breach of any such covenants would result in a default under the existing debt agreements that would permit the lenders to declare all borrowings under such debt agreements to be immediately due and payable and, through cross default provisions, would entitle the Company’s other lenders to accelerate their loans. At December 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with these covenants.
The Company expects on an ongoing basis to be able to finance operating cash require
ments, capital expenditures, and debt service
 from the current cash, cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and amounts available under its existing borrowing facilities. The Company’s credit facilities are further discussed in Note 14, Financing Arrangements, in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 
The cash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally used to finance the subsidiaries’ operating activities and future foreign investments. The Company has the ability to repatriate cash to the United States, which could result in an adjustment to the tax liability for foreign withholding taxes, foreign and/or U.S. state income taxes, and the impact of foreign currency movements. At December 31, 2024, management believed that sufficient liquidity was available in the United States and expects this to continue for the next twelve months. The Company has repatriated and expects to continue repatriating certain funds from its non-U.S. subsidiaries that are not needed to finance local operations. Repatriation activities both performed and contemplated to date have not resulted in, and are not expected to result in, any significant incremental tax liability to the Company. 
The Company continues to review its debt portfolio and may refinance additional debt or add debt in the near-term based on strategic capital management. The Company believes there is sufficient liquidity available for the next twelve months.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
At December 31, 2024, the Company held $34 million of precious metals on consignment from several financial institutions. Under these consignment arrangements, the financial institutions own the precious metal, and, accordingly, the 
57
Company does not report this consigned inventory as part of its inventory on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These consignment agreements allow the Company to acquire the precious metal at market rates at a point in time, which is approximately the same time, and for the same price as alloys are sold to the Company’s customers. If the financial institutions would discontinue offering these consignment arrangements, and if the Company could not obtain other comparable arrangements, the Company may be required to obtain third-party financing to fund an ownership position to maintain precious metal inventory at operational levels. For additional details, see Item 7A “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk - Consignment Arrangements.”

Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2024, the Company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority; therefore, $51 million of unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. See Note 16, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Material Trends in Capital Resources
On July 29, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an additional plan to restructure the Company’s business to improve operational performance and drive stockholder value creation (the “2024 Plan”). In connection with the 2024 Plan, the Company anticipates a net reduction in the Company’s global workforce of approximately 2% to 4%. The Company anticipates that the 2024 Plan will be substantially completed by the end of 2025 and result in $80 million to $100 million in annual cost savings. The proposed changes are subject to co-determination processes with employee representative groups in countries where required. 
As of December 31, 2024, in conjunction with the 2024 Plan, the Company has incurred $28 million in restructuring charges from inception, primarily related to employee transition, severance payments and employee benefits. Actions taken under the 2024 Plan seek to further streamline the Company’s operations and global footprint, as well as improve alignment of the Company’s cost structure with its strategic growth objectives. The Company expects to incur between $35 million and $50 million in non-recurring restructuring charges under the 2024 Plan which are expected to be expensed and paid in cash by the end of 2025.
On February 14, 2023, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a plan to restructure the business through a new operating model with five global business units, optimize central functions and overall management infrastructure, and implement other efforts aimed at cost savings (the “2023 Plan”). The Company estimated a reduction in its global workforce of approximately 8% to 10% and annual cost savings of approximately $200 million pursuant to the 2023 Plan. The target for cost savings has been substantially met, with the benefits mostly offset in the short term by additional investments in sales personnel, the Company’s new global ERP system, and other transformation initiatives.
As of December 31, 2024, in conjunction with the 2023 Plan, the Company incurred $87 million in restructuring charges, from inception, primarily related to employee transition, severance payments, employee benefits, and facility closure costs, and $20 million in other non-recurring costs related to restructuring activities, which mostly consist of consulting, legal and other 
professional service fees. Remaining restructuring charges attributable to the 2023 Plan are not expected to be material.
58
The estimates of the charges and expenditures that the Company expects to incur in connection with the 2024 Plan, and the timing thereof, are subject to several assumptions, including local law requirements in various jurisdictions and co-determination aspects in countries where required. Actual amounts may differ materially from estimates. In addition, the Company may incur additional charges or cash expenditures not currently contemplated due to unanticipated events that may occur, including in connection with the implementation of the 2024 Plan. For further information, refer to Note 18, Restructuring and Other Costs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Beginning in the second quarter of 2022, the Company’s financial results have also been impacted by the costs associated with the internal investigation conducted by the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors, along with associated litigation and an external investigation by the SEC, both of which are ongoing. For the year ended December 31, 2022, these costs totaled approximately $61 million. For the year ended December 31, 2023, these costs totaled $19 million. The costs in 2023 were offset by a $17 million gain from release of employee compensation accruals resulting from a settlement in the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2024, these costs totaled $11 million. The Company expects that it will continue to incur such costs into 2025 pertaining to the matters described in Note 21, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK
The Company’s major market risk exposures include changing interest rates, movements in foreign currency exchange rates and potential price volatility of commodities used by the Company in its manufacturing processes. The Company’s policy is to manage risk of exposure to interest rates using a combination of fixed and floating rate debt as well as interest rate swaps. The Company employs foreign currency denominated debt and currency swaps which serve to partially offset the Company’s exposure on its net investments in subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies. The Company’s policy generally is to hedge major foreign currency transaction exposures through foreign exchange forward contracts. These contracts are entered into with major financial institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. The Company is subject to other foreign exchange market risk exposure in addition to the risks on its financial instruments, such as possible impacts on its pricing and production costs, which are difficult to reasonably predict, and have therefore not been included below.
Foreign Exchange Risk Management
The Company enters into derivative financial instruments to hedge the foreign exchange revaluation risk associated with recorded assets and liabilities that are denominated in a non-functional currency. The Company hedges various currencies, primarily in euros, Swedish kronor and Swiss francs. The gains and losses on these derivative transactions offset the gains and losses generated by the revaluation of the underlying non-functional currency balances.
The Company primarily uses forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency basis swaps to hedge these risks. The Company uses a layered hedging program to hedge select anticipated foreign currency cash flows to reduce volatility in both cash flows and reported earnings of the consolidated Company. These cash flow hedges have maturities of six to 18 months and do not change the underlying long-term foreign currency exchange risk. The Company has numerous investments in foreign subsidiaries the most significant of which are denominated in euros, Swiss francs, Japanese yen and Swedish kronor. The net assets of these subsidiaries are exposed to volatility in currency exchange rates.
Currently, the Company uses both derivative and non-derivative financial instruments, including foreign currency-denominated debt held at the parent company level and foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge some of this exposure. Translation gains and losses related to the net assets of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are offset by gains and losses in the non-derivative and derivative financial instruments designated as hedges of net investment. At December 31, 2024, a 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar against all other currencies would decrease the net fair value associated with the forward foreign exchange contracts by approximately $91 million.
Interest Rate Risk Management
The Company enters into financial instruments, including derivatives, that expose the Company to market risk related to changes in interest rates. The Company uses a combination of financial instruments, including long-term and short-term financing, variable-rate commercial paper and derivative interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing.
At December 31, 2024, an increase of 1% in the interest rates on the variable interest rate instruments would decrease the Company’s fair value associated with the derivative interest rate swaps by approximately $6 million. 
60
Consignment Arrangements
The Company holds on a consignment basis, from various financial institutions, the precious metals used in the production of precious metal dental alloy products. Under these consignment arrangements, the financial institutions own the precious metal, and, accordingly, the Company does not report this inventory on consignment as part of its inventory on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The consignment agreements allow the Company to take ownership of the metal at approximately the same time customer orders are received and to closely match the price of the metal acquired to the price charged to the customer (i.e., the price charged to the customer is largely a pass through). These agreements are cancellable by either party at the end of each consignment period, which typically run for a period of one to nine months; however, because the Company typically has access to numerous financial institutions with excess capacity, consignment needs created by cancellations can be shifted among other institutions.
As precious metal prices fluctuate, the Company evaluates the impact of the precious metal price fluctuation on its target gross margins for precious metal dental alloy products and may revise the prices customers are charged for precious metal dental alloy products accordingly. While the Company does not separately invoice customers for the precious metal content of precious metal dental alloy products, the underlying precious metal content is the primary component of the cost and sales price of the precious metal dental alloy products. For practical purposes, if the precious metal prices go up or down by a small amount, the Company will not immediately modify prices, as long as the cost of precious metals embedded in the Company’s precious metal dental alloy price closely approximates the market price of the precious metal. If there is a significant change in the price of precious metals, the Company adjusts the price for the precious metal dental alloys, maintaining its margin on the products.
At December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately 21,000 troy ounces of precious metal, primarily gold, platinum, palladium and silver on consignment for periods of less than one year with a market value of $34 million. Under the terms of the consignment agreements, the Company also makes compensatory payments to the consignor banks based on a percentage of the value of the consigned precious metals inventory. At December 31, 2024, the average annual rate charged by the consignor banks was 1.7%. These compensatory payments are considered to be a cost of the metals purchased and are recorded as part of the cost of products sold.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management of the Company has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making its assessment, management used the criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based on its assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on the criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the COSO.
The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, changes in equity, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 8 (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 27, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
Goodwill — Implant and Prosthetic Solutions and Orthodontic Aligner Solutions Reporting Units — Refer to Note 11 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company’s evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The Company used the discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of its reporting units, which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to discount rates and forecasts of future revenues and operating margins. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both. The goodwill balance for the Orthodontic and Implant Solutions segment is comprised of the Implant & Prosthetic Solutions (IPS) and Orthodontic Aligner Solutions (OAS) reporting units. As of the annual goodwill impairment assessment date (April 1, 2024), the fair values of the IPS and OAS reporting units exceeded their carrying values and, therefore, no impairment was recognized.

64
Subsequent to the annual impairment assessment date, management identified indicators of “more likely than not” impairments related to its IPS and OAS reporting units. As a result of the interim tests, management recorded goodwill impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2024 related to the OAS and IPS reporting units.

We identified the Company’s impairment evaluations of goodwill at IPS and OAS to be a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments made by management to estimate the fair values of IPS and OAS and the sensitivity of IPS’s and OAS’s future revenues and operating margins to changes in demand. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenues and operating margins, and the selection of discount rates.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the forecasts of future revenues and operating margins (“forecasts”), and the selection of discount rates for the IPS and OAS reporting units included the following, among others:

•
We tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls over management’s goodwill impairment evaluation, including those over the evaluation of possible triggering events that might have occurred throughout the year and the determination of the fair values of IPS and OAS, such as controls related to management’s forecasts and selection of discount rates.

•
We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s forecasts through consideration of (1) current and past performance of the reporting units, (2) consistency with external peer and industry data, (3) the impact of changes in the regulatory environment on the reporting units, and (4) consistency with management’s growth strategy and evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.

•
With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the discount rates, including testing the underlying source information and the mathematical accuracy of the calculations, and developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rates selected by management.
Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets – Orthodontic and Implant Solutions and Connected Technology Solutions Segments — Refer to Note 11 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company’s evaluation of indefinite-lived assets for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of each asset to its carrying value. The Company uses a relief-from-royalty methodology to estimate the fair value of its indefinite-lived trade names and trademarks, which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to the discount rate, royalty rate, and forecasts of future revenues. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any intangible asset impairment charge, or both. Management conducted an impairment test as of the annual impairment assessment date (April 1, 2024), and also conducts an impairment test whenever events or circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, management identified indicators of a “more likely than not” impairment of certain of its indefinite-lived trade names and trademarks within its Connected Technology Solutions (CTS) segment and within the IPS reporting unit of the Orthodontic and Implant Solutions (OIS) segment. As a result of performing impairment tests, management recorded impairment charges related to indefinite-lived intangible assets within its CTS and OIS segments.
We identified the Company’s impairment evaluation of indefinite-lived intangibles related to the CTS segment and the IPS reporting unit of the OIS segment to be a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments made by management to estimate the fair value of trade names and trademarks. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenues, and the selection of discount and royalty rates.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
65
Our audit procedures related to the forecasts of future revenues and the selection of discount and royalty rates for the trade names and trademarks within the CTS segment and the IPS reporting unit of the OIS segment included the following, among others:

•
We tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls over management’s indefinite-lived asset impairment evaluation, including those over the evaluation of possible triggering events occurring throughout the year and the determination of the fair value of trade names and trademarks, such as controls related to management’s revenue forecasts and selection of the discount and royalty rates.

•
We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s revenue forecasts through consideration of (1) current and past performance, (2) consistency with external peer and industry data, (3) the impact of changes in the regulatory environment, and (4) consistency with management’s growth strategy and evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.

•
With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated discount and royalty rates, including testing the underlying source information and mathematical accuracy of the calculations, and developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount and royalty rates selected by management.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 27, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

DENTSPLY SIRONA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 - 
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Description of Business
DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. (“Dentsply Sirona” or the “Company”), is the world’s largest diversified manufacturer of dental products and technologies, with a 
138
-year history of innovation and service to the dental industry and patients worldwide. The Company’s principal product categories include dental consumable products, dental equipment, dental technologies and continence care consumable products. The Company sells its products in approximately 
150
 countries under some of the most well-established brand names in the industry.
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the results of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include deposits with banks as well as highly liquid time deposits with original maturities of ninety days or less. The balance as of December 31, 2024 includes $
39
 million of cash and cash equivalents located in Russia which is available for use in local operations but limited in its ability to be transferred out of the country due to control measures currently in place by the Russian government.
Accounts Receivable
The Company recognizes a receivable when it has an unconditional right to payment, which represents the amount the Company expects to collect in a transaction. Payment terms are typically 30 days in the United States but may be longer in markets outside the United States. In general, contracts containing significant financing components are not material to the Company’s financial statements. 
The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based on an estimate of current expected credit losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The allowance is determined based on a combination of factors, including the length of time that the receivable is past due, history of write-offs, and the Company’s knowledge of circumstances relating to specific customers’ ability to meet their financial obligations. The provision for doubtful accounts is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For customers on credit terms, the Company performs ongoing credit evaluation of those customers’ financial condition and generally does not require collateral from them.
 See Note 2, Revenue Recognition, for additional information on Accounts Receivable.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The cost of inventories is based upon the first-in, first-out method (
“
FIFO
”
) or average cost methods.
The Company establishes reserves for inventory estimated to be excess, obsolete or unmarketable based upon assumptions about future demand, market conditions, and expiration of products.
74
Valuation of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived and Definite-Lived Intangible Assets
Goodwill
Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill is not subject to amortization but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually in accordance with US GAAP as of April 1 of each year, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. The Company performs impairment tests by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount to determine if there is a potential impairment. If the carrying value of a reporting unit with goodwill exceeds its respective fair value, an impairment charge is recognized for the excess amount. Additional information related to the testing for goodwill impairment, including results of the annual test performed as of April 1, 2024 and the interim impairment assessments performed in the third and fourth quarters of 2024, is provided in Note 11, Goodwill and Intangible Assets.
Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of trade names and trademarks and in-process research and development (“R&D”) acquired in business combinations, and these are not subject to amortization. Valuations of indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired in business combinations are based on information and assumptions available at the time of their acquisition, using income and market approaches to determine fair value. The Company conducts an impairment test in accordance with US GAAP as of April 1 of each year, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets may be impaired. Potential impairment is identified by comparing the fair value of an intangible asset to its carrying value. Additional information related to the testing for indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment, including results of the annual test performed as of April 1, 2024 and the interim impairment assessments performed in the first, third, and fourth quarters of 2024, is provided in Note 11, Goodwill and Intangible Assets.
Definite-Lived Intangible Assets
Definite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of patents, trade names, trademarks, licensing agreements, developed technology, and customer relationships. The valuation of definite-lived intangible assets acquired in business combinations is based on information and assumptions available at the time of acquisition, using income and market model approaches to determine fair value. 
Identifiable definite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a basis that best reflects how their economic benefits are utilized over the life of the asset or on a straight-line basis if not materially different from actual utilization. The useful life is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute to the future cash flows of the Company. 
The Company uses the following useful lives for its definite-lived intangible assets: 
Definite-Lived Intangible Asset Type
Useful Life
Patents
Up to the date the patent expires
Trade names and trademarks
Up to 
20
 years
Licensing agreements
Up to 
20
 years
Customer relationships
Up to 
15
 years
Developed technology
Up to 
15
 years
When the expected useful life of an intangible is not known, the Company will estimate its useful life based on similar assets or asset groups, any legal, regulatory, or contractual provision that limits the useful life, the effect of economic factors, including obsolescence, demand, competition, and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future economic benefit from the asset.
These assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The Company closely monitors all intangible assets, including those related to new and existing technologies, for indicators of impairment as these assets have more risk of becoming impaired. Impairment is based upon an initial evaluation of the identifiable undiscounted cash flows. If the initial evaluation identifies a potential impairment, a fair value of the asset is determined by using a discounted cash flow valuation. If impaired, the resulting charge reflects the excess of the asset’s carrying cost over its fair value.
75
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Assets acquired through acquisitions are recorded at fair value
. The Company capitalizes costs incurred in the development or acquisition of software, whether for internal or external use, and expenses costs incurred in the preliminary project planning stage. 
E
xcept for leasehold improvements, depreciation and amortization is computed by the straight-line method over the assets estimated useful lives: 
Property, Plant and Equipment Assets Type
Useful Life
Buildings
40
 years
Machinery and Equipment
2
 to 
15
 years
Capitalized Software
2
 to 
10
 years
Leasehold Improvements
Shorter of the estimated useful life or the term of the lease
Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred; replacements and major improvements are capitalized. If events or circumstances exist which suggest that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be recoverable, the identifiable undiscounted cash flows of the asset group are compared to the carrying value of the asset. If the carrying value is in excess of the identifiable undiscounted cash flows, the excess of the asset group’s carrying cost over its fair value is recorded as an impairment charge.
Leases 
The Company leases real estate, automobiles and equipment under various operating and finance leases. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease or contains a lease at inception. Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the implicit rate is not readily determinable in most of the Company’s lease agreements, the Company uses its estimated secured incremental borrowing rate, based on the information available at commencement of the lease, to determine the present value of lease payments. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. Any new real estate and equipment operating lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, are accounted for as a single lease component; auto leases are accounted for as separate lease components.
The Company’s leases have remaining lease terms of approximately 
1
 year to 
9
 years. Many of the Company’s real estate and equipment leases have one or more options to renew, with terms that can extend primarily from 
1
 year to 
3
 years, which are not included in the initial lease term until considered reasonably certain of renewal. The Company does not have lease agreements with residual value guarantees, sale-and-leaseback terms, or material restrictive covenants. The Company does not have any material sublease arrangements.
 See Note 10, Leases for additional information.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company employs derivative financial instruments to hedge certain anticipated transactions, firm commitments, and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Additionally, the Company manages exposure to changes in interest rates by utilizing interest rate swaps that have the effect of converting floating rate debt to fixed rate, or vice versa. 
The benefit or loss from interest rate swaps is recorded in Interest expense, net in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations consistent with the classification of interest expense attributable to the underlying debt. 
The Company records all derivative instruments at fair value and changes in fair value are recorded each period in the consolidated statements of operations or accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”). The Company classifies derivative assets and liabilities as current when the remaining term of the derivative contract is one year or less. The Company has elected to classify the cash flows from derivative instruments in the same category as the cash flows from the items being hedged. Should the Company enter into a derivative instrument that includes an other-than-insignificant financing element then all cash flows will be classified as financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as required by US GAAP.
 See Note 19, Financial Instruments for additional information.
76
Pension and Other Postemployment Benefits
Some of the employees of the Company and its subsidiaries are covered by government or Company-sponsored defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans. Additionally, certain salaried employee groups in the United States are covered by postemployment healthcare plans. Projected benefit obligations and net periodic costs for Company-sponsored defined benefit and postemployment benefit plans are based on an annual actuarial valuation that includes assessment of key assumptions relating to expected return on plan assets, discount rates, employee compensation increase rates and health care cost trends. Expected return on plan assets, discount rates and health care cost trend assumptions are particularly important when determining the Company’s benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs associated with postemployment benefits. Changes in these assumptions can impact the Company’s earnings. In determining the cost of postemployment benefits, certain assumptions are established annually to reflect market conditions and plan experience to appropriately reflect the expected costs as determined by actuaries. These assumptions include medical inflation trend rates, discount rates, employee turnover and mortality rates. The Company predominantly uses liability durations in establishing its discount rates, which are observed from indices of high-grade corporate bond yields in the respective economic regions of the plans. The expected return on plan assets is the weighted average long-term expected return based upon asset allocations and historic average returns for the markets where the assets are invested, principally in foreign locations. The Company reports the funded status of its defined benefit pension and other postemployment benefit plans on its consolidated balance sheets as a net liability or asset.
 See Note 17, Benefit Plans for additional information.
Accruals for Self-Insured Losses
The Company maintains insurance for certain risks, including workers’ compensation, and is self-insured for employee-related healthcare benefits. The Company accrues for the expected costs associated with these risks by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other relevant information. Costs are recognized in the period the claim is incurred, and the financial statement accruals include an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. The Company has stop-loss coverage to limit its exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis.
Litigation
The Company and its subsidiaries, from time to time, are parties to lawsuits arising from operations. The Company records liabilities when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. If these estimates are in the form of ranges, the Company records the liabilities at the most likely outcome within the range. If no point within the range represents a better estimate of the probable loss, then the low point in the range is accrued. The ranges established by management are based on analysis made by internal and external legal counsel who consider the best information known at the time. If the Company determines that a contingency is reasonably possible, it considers the same information to estimate the possible exposure and discloses any material potential liability. These loss contingencies are monitored regularly for a change in fact or circumstance that would require an accrual adjustment. Legal costs related to these lawsuits are expensed as incurred.
 For additional information on ongoing litigation see Note 21, Commitments and Contingencies.
Foreign Currency Translation
The local currency of foreign operations is generally considered to be their functional currency. In the case of operations within highly inflationary economies, which for the Company include Argentina and Turkey, the Company remeasures the financial statements of entities in those countries with the U.S. dollar as the functional currency.
Adjustments resulting from the process of translating the financial statements of entities with foreign functional currencies into U.S. dollars are included in AOCI in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company had a translation loss of $
192
 million and a gain on its loans designated as hedges of net investments of $
46
 million. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company had a translation gain of $
78
 million and a loss on its loans designated as hedges of net investments of $
29
 million. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company had a translation loss of $
188
 million and a gain on its loans designated as hedges of net investments of $
32
 million.
Foreign currency gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved are included within Other (income) expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
 During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company had a net foreign currency gain of $
21
 million, gain of $
3
 million, and loss of $
6
 million, respectively.
77
Revenue Recognition
Revenues are derived primarily from the sale of dental equipment and dental and healthcare consumable products. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services in accordance with ASC 606-10, 
Revenues from Contracts with Customers
. Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied; this occurs with the transfer of control of products and services to the Company’s customers, which for products generally occurs when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer, and for services generally occurs as the customer receives and consumes the benefit. Sales, value-added, and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. 
Certain contracts with the Company’s customers include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately may require significant judgment. The Company generally uses an observable price, typically average selling price, to determine the stand-alone selling price for separate performance obligations. The Company determines the stand-alone selling prices based on its database of pricing and discounting practices from among the Company’s varied geographic sales locations and for specific products or services when sold separately, and the Company utilizes this data to arrive at average selling prices by product. In cases where an average selling price is not observable, the Company determines the stand-alone selling price using relevant information and applies suitable estimation methods including, but not limited to, the cost plus a margin approach. Revenue is then allocated proportionately, based on the determined stand-alone selling price, to each distinct performance obligation.
The Company exercises judgment in estimating variable consideration, which primarily includes volume discounts, sales rebates, product returns, and certain extended warranty arrangements. The Company adjusts the estimate of revenue at the earlier of when the most likely amount of consideration can be estimated, the amount expected to be received changes, or when the consideration becomes fixed. The Company estimates volume discounts by evaluating specific inputs and assumptions, including the individual customer’s historical and estimated future product purchases. Discounts are deducted from revenue at the time of sale or when the discount is offered, whichever is later. In estimating sales rebates, the Company evaluates inputs such as customer-specific trends, terms of the customers’ contracted rebate program, historical experience, and the forecasted performance of a customer and their expected level of achievement within the rebate programs. The accruals for these rebate programs are updated as actual results and updated forecasts impact the estimated achievement for customers within the rebate programs. When the Company gives customers the right to return eligible products and receive credit, returns are estimated based on an analysis of historical experience. However, returns of products, excluding warranty-related returns, are not material. 
To the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration, the Company applies judgment in constraining the estimated variable consideration due to factors that may cause reversal of cumulative revenue recognized. The Company evaluates constraints based on its historical and projected experience with similar customer contracts.
For most of its products, the Company transfers control and recognizes revenue when products are shipped from the Company’s manufacturing facility or warehouse to the customer. For contracts with customers that contain destination shipping terms, revenue is not recognized until the goods are delivered to the agreed-upon destination. As such, the Company’s performance obligations related to product sales are satisfied at a point in time when customers obtain the use of, and substantially all of the benefit of, the products.
The Company recognizes revenue from support and maintenance contracts, extended warranties, and certain other contract performance obligations over time based on the period of the contracts or as the services are performed, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Company’s performance of the services. In general, the total amount of revenue recognized over time is not material to the Company’s financial statements.
Depending on the terms of its contracts, the Company defers the recognition of a portion of revenue on a relative stand-alone selling price basis when certain performance obligations are not yet satisfied. Consideration received from customers in advance of revenue recognition is classified as deferred revenue. For certain locations, the Company offers a loyalty points program to customers. A portion of the revenue generated in a sale is allocated to the loyalty points earned and is deferred until the loyalty points are redeemed or expire. 
The Company has elected to account for shipping and handling activities as a fulfillment cost within the cost of products sold, and records shipping and handling costs collected from customers in net sales. The Company has adopted one practical expedient: relief from considering the existence of a significant financing component when the payment for the good or service is expected to be one year or less.

Cost of Products Sold
Cost of products sold represents costs directly related to the manufacture and distribution of the Company’s products, and include costs of raw materials, packaging, direct labor, overhead, shipping and handling, warehousing and the depreciation of manufacturing, warehousing and distribution facilities and amortization of intangible assets. Overhead and related expenses include salaries, wages, employee benefits, utilities, lease costs, maintenance and property taxes.
Warranties
The Company provides manufacturer’s warranties on certain equipment products. Estimated warranty costs are accrued when sales are made to customers. Estimates for warranty costs are based primarily on historical warranty claim experience. Warranty costs are included in Cost of products sold in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Company’s warranty expense and warranty accrual were as follows:

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
SG&A represents indirect costs associated with generating revenues and managing the operations of the Company. Such costs include advertising and marketing expenses, salaries, employee benefits, incentive compensation, travel, office expenses, lease costs, amortization of capitalized software developed for internal use, and depreciation of administrative facilities. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
Research and Development Costs
R&D costs, including internal labor costs, material costs, consulting expenses, and certain overhead expenses, such as facilities and information technology costs directly attributable to R&D activities, are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Software development costs related to software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed that are incurred prior to the attainment of technological feasibility are considered R&D and are expensed as incurred. Once technological feasibility is established, the cost of software developed for external use is capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Amortization of these costs are included in Cost of products sold over the estimated life of the products.

Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date at fair value, and is recognized as an expense over the employee’s requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the equity awards). The compensation cost is only recognized for the portion of the awards that are expected to vest.
Stock options granted become exercisable as determined by the grant agreement and expire 
ten years
 after the date of grant under the Company’s stock-based compensation plans. Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”) vest as determined by the grant agreement and are subject to a service condition, which requires grantees to remain employed by the Company during the period following the date of grant. Under the terms of the RSUs, the vesting period is referred to as the restricted period. In addition to the service condition, certain RSUs are subject to performance requirements that can vary between the first year and the final year of the RSU award. For a given RSU award which is subject to performance requirements, the number of shares which vest may be adjusted upward or downward from the target amount to reflect the achievement level. Upon the expiration of the applicable restricted period and the satisfaction of any applicable performance conditions imposed, the restrictions on RSUs will lapse, and shares of common stock will be issued for each vested RSU. Upon death, disability or qualified retirement, awards continue to vest per the remaining grant term and are pro-rated if the grant date is less than twelve months from the date of separation. Awards are expensed as compensation over their respective vesting periods or to the eligible retirement date if shorter. The Company records forfeitures on stock-based compensation as the participant terminates rather than estimating forfeitures.
79
Income Taxes
The Company’s income tax expense or benefit includes U.S. and international income taxes plus the provision for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries not considered to be permanently reinvested. Tax credits and other incentives reduce income tax expense in the year the credits are claimed. Certain items of income and expense are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized in future years. The Company establishes a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which realization is not likely.
The Company applies a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company recognizes in the consolidated financial statements the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position.
The Company’s tax positions are subject to ongoing examinations by tax authorities. The Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions throughout the world and in the normal course of business is examined by taxing authorities in those jurisdictions. Adjustments to uncertain tax positions are recorded when taxing authority examinations are completed, statutes of limitation are closed, changes in tax laws occur or as new information comes to light regarding the technical merits of a given tax position.
Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing net earnings attributable to the Company’s stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net earnings attributable to the Company’s stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period, adjusted for the effect of an assumed exercise of all dilutive options outstanding at the end of the period, unless the impact of including these options is anti-dilutive.
Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates
Investments in non-consolidated affiliates, joint ventures, and partnerships where the Company maintains significant influence over an entity but does not have control are accounted for using the equity method. The Company records the carrying value of these investments within other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and records the Company’s proportional share of the investees’ net earnings or losses within other (income) expense. Investments in which the Company does not exercise significant influence are recorded at cost, and assessed for any other-than-temporary impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable.
On December 7, 2023, the Company sold its minority interest in a UK-based, privately-held provider of healthcare consumables for $
13
 million. Prior to the sale, the Company recorded a loss of $
4
 million in Other (income) expense, net due to a forfeiture of accumulated earnings on the investment for declining its option to purchase the remaining ownership interest.
The Company’s equity-method net loss for the year ended December 31, 2024 was 
no
t significant. The Company’s equity-method net losses for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $
4
 million and $
36
 million, respectively. Loss from equity method investments for the year ended December 31, 2022 includes $
36
 million recorded in Other (income) expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for a write-off of the Company’s ownership position in a privately-held dental investment company following impairment of underlying investments held by the investment company and the Company’s determination that the remaining investment is not recoverable.

Noncontrolling Interests
The Company reports noncontrolling interest (“NCI”) in a subsidiary as a separate component of Equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Additionally, the Company reports the portion of net loss and comprehensive loss attributed to the Company and NCI separately in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, and in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.
80
Fair Value Measurement
Recurring Basis
The Company records certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with the accounting guidance, which defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date in current markets. The accounting guidance establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework associated with the level of observable pricing utilized in measuring financial instruments at fair value. The three broad levels defined by the fair value hierarchy are as follows:
Level 1 - Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reported date.
Level 2 - Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date. These financial instruments include derivative instruments whose fair value have been derived using a model where inputs to the model are directly observable in the market or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.
Level 3 - Instruments that have little to no observable pricing as of the reported date. These financial instruments do not have two-way markets and are measured using management’s best estimate of fair value, where the inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation.
The degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities generally correlates to the level of observable pricing. Observable pricing is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument. Financial assets and liabilities with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of pricing observability and a lesser degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value. Conversely, financial assets and liabilities rarely traded or not quoted will generally have less, or no pricing observability and a higher degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value.
The Company primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements and endeavors to utilize the best available information. Accordingly, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Additionally, the Company considers its credit risks and its counterparties’ credit risks when determining the fair values of its financial assets and liabilities. The Company records its derivatives and contingent considerations on a recurring fair value basis.
The Company believes the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable (net of allowance for doubtful accounts), prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, income taxes payable and notes payable approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. See Note 20, Fair Value Measurement for additional information.
Non-Recurring Basis
When events or circumstances require an asset or liability to be measured at fair value that otherwise is generally recorded based on another valuation method, such as, net realizable value, the Company will utilize the valuation techniques described above. The Company records its business combinations and impairments on a non-recurring basis.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures,” which requires disclosure of information about significant expenses in a public company’s reportable segment results on both an interim and annual basis. Public companies are required to disclose significant expense categories and amounts for each reportable segment. Significant expense categories are derived from expenses that are regularly reported to an entity’s chief operating decision-maker (“CODM”) and included in a segment’s reported measures of profit or loss. Public entities are also required to disclose the title and position of the CODM and explain how the CODM uses the reported measures of profit or loss to assess segment performance. This standard was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company has adopted this accounting standard, and the related disclosures are included in Note 6, Segment and Geographic Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 
Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures,” which requires public entities to disclose additional income tax information, primarily related to the income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid on an annual basis. The amendments are intended to enhance the transparency and decision-usefulness of income tax disclosures and are effective as of January 1, 2025. Early adoption is permitted and should be applied prospectively. The Company expects this ASU to only impact the Company’s disclosures with no impacts to results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, “Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40) Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses,” which requires disaggregated disclosure of income statement expenses for public business entities (“PBEs”). In January 2025, the FASB issued ASU No. 2025-01 “Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40),” which clarified the effective date for ASU No. 2024-03. These amendments are intended to provide more information about types of expenses in commonly presented expense captions. The amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-04, “Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) Induced Conversions of Convertible Debt Instruments,” which amends ASC 470-202 to clarify the requirements related to accounting for the settlement of a debt instrument as an induced conversion. The amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2025, and interim periods within those annual reporting periods, and early adoption is permitted if the entity has also adopted ASU 2020-06 “Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40)” for that period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

Contract Assets and Liabilities
The Company does not typically have contract assets in the course of its business. Contract liabilities, which represent billings in excess of revenue recognized, are primarily related to advanced billings for customer orthodontic treatments where the performance obligation has not yet been satisfied, and deferred revenue associated with loyalty points earned but not yet redeemed by customers under the Company’s loyalty point program. The Company had deferred revenue of $
95
 million and $
49
 million presented in Accrued liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2024. The Company recorded deferred revenue of $
91
 million and $
57
 million presented in Accrued liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2023. The Company recognized $
79
 million of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024 which was previously deferred as of December 31, 2023. The amount recognized in the year ended December 31, 2024 includes a $
9
 million reduction in revenue for a refund reserve related to the realignment of the Byte aligner business as described in Note 18, Restructuring and Other Costs. The Company recognized $
68
 million of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 which was previously deferred as of December 31, 2022. The Company expects to recognize most of the remaining deferred revenue in net sales within the next twelve months.
83
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Accounts and notes receivable-trade, net are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts and trade discounts, which were $
14
 million and $
17
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, changes to the allowance for doubtful accounts, including write-offs of accounts receivable that were previously reserved, were not significant. Changes to the allowance for doubtful accounts are presented in Selling, general, and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

NOTE 3 - 
STOCK COMPENSATION
The Company maintains the 2024 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), which was approved by the Company’s stockholders on May 22, 2024 (the “Effective Date”). The Company’s stockholders previously approved the 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Prior Plan”). After the Effective Date, no new awards may be granted under the Prior Plan, although awards granted under the Prior Plan prior to the Effective Date remain outstanding and remain subject to the terms and conditions of, and continue to be governed by, the Prior Plan. Under the Plan, the Company may grant stock options, share appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted share units, share bonuses, other share-based awards, or cash awards, collectively referred to as “Awards.” The Company’s non-qualified stock options (“NQSOs”) are granted at exercise prices that are at least equal to the closing stock price on the date of grant. Under the Plan, 
14.5
 million shares are initially available for Awards, less (i) 
one
 share for every one share that was subject to an option or share appreciation right granted after March 26, 2024 under the Prior Plan and (ii) 
2.7
 shares for every one share that was subject to an award other than an option or share appreciation right granted after March 26, 2024 under the Prior Plan (such adjusted amount, the “Share Pool”). Under the Plan, any shares that are subject to options or share appreciation rights shall be counted against the Share Pool as 
one
 share for every one share granted, and any shares that are subject to awards other than options or share appreciation rights shall be counted against the Share Pool as 
2.7
 shares for every one share granted. Shares granted under either the Plan or the Prior Plan which are cancelled or forfeited are added back to the count of shares available for Awards. The number of shares available for grant under the Plan at December 31, 2024 is 
16
 million.

NOTE 6 - 
SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION
The Company has 
four
 operating segments, organized primarily by product, which are also the Company’s reportable segments. These are (i) Connected Technology Solutions, (ii) Essential Dental Solutions, (iii) Orthodontic and Implant Solutions, and (iv) Wellspect Healthcare. They generally have overlapping geographical presence, customer bases, distribution channels, and regulatory oversight with the exception of Wellspect Healthcare, which has a more discrete market and regulatory environment specific to the medical device industry. These operating segments, which also form the Company’s reportable segments, are identified in accordance with how the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) regularly reviews financial results and uses this information to evaluate the Company’s performance and allocate resources. The Company’s CODM is the Chief Executive Officer.
The CODM assesses performance of the segments based on the net sales and adjusted operating income. Segment adjusted operating income is defined as operating income before income taxes and before certain unallocated corporate costs, interest expense, net, other (income) expense, net, goodwill and intangible asset impairments, restructuring and other costs, amortization of intangible assets, other acquisition costs, and depreciation resulting from the fair value step-up of property, plant, and equipment from business combinations. Asset and other balance sheet information is not reported to the CODM.
The CODM uses both net sales and segment adjusted operating income for each segment during development of the annual operating plan and the regular forecasting process. Additionally, the CODM considers budget-to-actual variances for these measures on a quarterly basis as well as segment-specific forecasting when making decisions about the allocation of operating and capital resources to each segment. 
A description of the products and services provided within each of the Company’s 
four
 reportable segments is provided below.
Connected Technology Solutions
This segment includes the design, manufacture and sales of the Company’s dental technology and equipment products. These products include the Equipment & Instruments and CAD/CAM product categories.
Equipment & Instruments
The Equipment & Instruments product category consists of basic and high-tech dental equipment such as imaging equipment, motorized dental handpieces, treatment centers, and other instruments for dental practitioners and specialists. Imaging equipment serves as a key point of entry to the Company’s digital workflow offerings and consists of a broad range of diagnostic imaging systems for 2D or 3D, panoramic, and intraoral applications, as well as cone-beam computed tomography systems (“CBCT”). Treatment centers comprise a broad range of products from basic dental chairs to sophisticated chair-based units with integrated diagnostic, hygienic and ergonomic functionalities, as well as specialist centers used in preventive treatment and for training purposes. This product group also includes other lab equipment, such as amalgamators, mixing machines and porcelain furnaces. 
CAD/CAM
Dental CAD/CAM technologies are products designed for dental professionals to support numerous digital workflows for procedures such as dental restorations through integrations with DS Core, our cloud-based platform. This product category includes intraoral scanners, 3-D printers, mills, and certain software and services, as well as a full-chairside economical restoration of esthetic ceramic dentistry offering called CEREC, which enables dentists to practice same-day or single visit dentistry. 
Essential Dental Solutions
This segment includes the development, manufacture and sales of the Company’s value-added endodontic, restorative, and preventive consumable products and small equipment used by dental professionals for the treatment of patients. Offerings in this segment also include specialized treatment products including products used in the creation of dental appliances. 
Essential Dental Solutions products are designed to operate in an integrated system to provide solutions for high-tech dental procedures. The endodontic products include motorized endodontic handpieces, files, sealers, irrigation needles and other tools or single-use solutions which support root canal procedures. The restorative products include dental ceramics and other materials used in prosthetic restorations including crowns and veneers.
91
The preventive products include small equipment products such as curing light systems, dental diagnostic systems and ultrasonic scalers and polishers, as well as other dental supplies including dental anesthetics, prophylaxis paste, dental sealants and impression materials.
Orthodontic and Implant Solutions
This segment includes the design, manufacture, and sales of the Company’s various digital implant systems and innovative dental implant products, digital dentures and dental professional-directed aligner solutions. Offerings in this segment also include application of our digital services and technology, including those provided by DS Core, our cloud-based platform.
Orthodontics 
The Orthodontics product category includes SureSmile, a clear aligner solution provided through clinician offices, and Byte, a direct-to-consumer clear aligner solution. The Orthodontics product category includes a High Frequency Vibration technology device known as VPro, as well as the SureSmile Simulator which uses intraoral scanners and our DS Core platform to create a 3D visualization of patient outcomes and SureSmile aligner solutions, which include whitening kits and retainers. The aligner offerings also include software technology that enables aligner treatment planning and the seamless connectivity of a digital workflow from diagnostics through treatment delivery. Byte operations were significantly reduced after October 24, 2024 and limited to supporting patients already undergoing treatment, following a decision to voluntarily suspend sales and marketing of Byte aligners and impression kits. In January 2025, the Company subsequently announced it will no longer offer the Byte direct-to-consumer clear aligner solution and has decided to leverage technologies developed by Byte elsewhere in the aligners portfolio to create orthodontic demand, support a digital clinical workflow, enhance the customer experience, and improve patient monitoring.
Implants & Prosthetics 
The Implants & Prosthetics product category includes technology to support the Company’s digital workflows for implant systems, a portfolio of innovative dental implant products, digital dentures, crown and bridge porcelain products, bone regenerative and restorative solutions, treatment planning software and educational programs. The Implants & Prosthetics product category is supported by key technologies including custom abutments, advanced tapered immediate load screws and regenerative bone growth factor. Offerings in this category also include dental prosthetics such as artificial teeth and precious metal dental alloys.
Wellspect Healthcare
This segment includes the design, manufacture, and sales of the Company’s innovative continence care solutions for both urinary and bowel management. Wellspect Healthcare is a leading global provider of innovative medical devices that help people suffering from urinary retention or chronic constipation. Wellspect is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of intermittent urinary catheters, with LoFric as the most known brand.

NOTE 11 - 
GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS
The Company’s policy is to assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually as of April 1, with more frequent assessments if events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset might be impaired. Impairment charges are recorded in Goodwill and intangible asset impairment in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
Impairment during the Three Months Ended March 31, 2024
In the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company identified indicators of a more likely than not impairment related to certain indefinite-lived imaging product trade names within the Connected Technology Solutions segment. The decline in fair value of these indefinite-lived trade names was driven by declines in volumes during the three months ended March 31, 2024, which were due in part to a loss in market share from competitive pricing pressures, as well as unfavorable economic conditions in certain markets. These factors contributed to a reduction in forecasted revenues in the near term. The trade names were evaluated for impairment using an income approach, specifically a relief from royalty method. As a result, the Company recorded an indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge of $
6
 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024.
Impairment during the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024
The Company identified indicators of a more likely than not impairment in the three months ended September 30, 2024 for 
two
 of its reporting units, Orthodontic Aligner Solutions and Implant & Prosthetic Solutions, which together comprise all of the Orthodontic and Implant Solutions segment. As a result, the Company recorded pre-tax goodwill impairment charges as of September 30, 2024 of $
145
 million for the Orthodontic Aligner Solutions reporting unit and $
359
 million for the Implant & Prosthetic Solutions reporting unit, both within the Orthodontic and Implant Solutions segment. The impairment charge related to the Orthodontic Aligner Solutions reporting unit resulted in a full write-off of the remaining goodwill balance for this reporting unit. 
Impairment during the Three Months Ended December 31, 2024
In the quarter ended December 31, 2024, the Company identified indicators of a more likely than not impairment for its Implant & Prosthetic Solutions reporting unit within the Orthodontic and Implant Solutions segment. The decline in fair value of this reporting unit was driven by a weaker trend in sales volumes, particularly in North America, increased competition from lower-priced alternatives impacting global markets, and adverse macroeconomic pressures impacting demand for elective dental procedures and premium implant solutions. These factors contributed to reduced forecasted revenues, lower operating margins, and reduced expectations for future cash flows. The fair value of the Implant & Prosthetic Solutions reporting unit was computed using a discounted cash flow model with inputs developed using both internal and market-based data. The discounted cash flow model uses 
ten
-year forecasted cash flows plus a terminal value based on capitalizing the last period’s cash flows using a perpetual growth rate. Significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model included, but were not limited to, the discount rate of 
12.5
%, revenue growth rates (including perpetual growth rates), operating margin percentages, and net working capital changes of the reporting unit’s business. As a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax goodwill impairment charge as of December 31, 2024 of $
269
 million for the Implant & Prosthetic Solutions reporting unit within the Orthodontic and Implant Solutions segment. 
Additionally, in the quarter ended December 31, 2024, the Company also identified indicators of more likely than not impairments for certain indefinite-lived intangible assets including trade names and trademarks within the Connected Technology Solutions segment, and certain trade names within the Implant & Prosthetic Solutions reporting unit within the Orthodontic and Implant Solutions segment. The decline in fair value of the trade names and trademarks was driven by weakened demand for the Company’s premium equipment and implant products, competitive pricing pressures, and a sustained higher cost of capital, which are contributing to reduced forecasted revenues. These indefinite-lived intangible assets were evaluated for impairment using an income approach, specifically a relief from royalty methodology. The Company’s significant assumptions in the relief from royalty method include, but are not limited to, discount rates ranging from 
12.5
% to 
14.5
%, revenue growth rates (including perpetual growth rates), and royalty rates. As a result, the Company recorded indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $
82
 million and $
1
 million for the Connected Technology Solutions and Orthodontic and Implant Solutions segments, respectively, for the three months ended December 31, 2024. 
As a result of suspending sales of Byte clear aligner and impression kits during the fourth quarter, and subsequently announcing plans that the Byte aligners would no longer be offered to new patients, the Company recorded a full write-off of the Byte trademark intangible asset within the Orthodontic and Implant Solutions segment, resulting in a charge of $
152
 million based on a determination that the trademark will not be used in the future operating model for aligners. The Company plans to continue to use technology associated with approximately $
178
 million in other intangible assets acquired with the Byte 
102
business, primarily developed technology acquired in the initial purchase of Byte, to support other product offerings and enhance customer experience elsewhere in the Company. See Note 18, Restructuring and Other Costs for additional information.
The remaining goodwill balance of the Implant & Prosthetic Solutions reporting unit was $
503
 million as of December 31, 2024, and the carrying values of indefinite-lived intangible assets with impairments in the fourth quarter were $
76
 million and $
149
 million for the Implant & Prosthetic Solutions and Connected Technology Solutions reporting units, respectively, as of December 31, 2024. 
As the fair values of the Implant & Prosthetic Solutions reporting unit and the indefinite-lived assets within the Implant & Prosthetic Solutions and Connected Technology Solutions reporting units, respectively, continue to approximate carrying value as of
 December 31, 2024, any further decline in key assumptions could result in additional impairments in future periods
.
Based on quantitative and qualitative analyses performed for the other reporting units and the Company’s other indefinite-lived intangible assets, the Company believes there is no indication that the carrying value more likely than not exceeds the fair value in each case as of December 31, 2024. For the Company’s reporting units that were not impaired, the Company applied a hypothetical sensitivity analysis by increasing the discount rate of these reporting units by 
50
 basis points. The results of this sensitivity analysis at December 31, 2024 indicate that none of the other reporting units would be impaired. 
There is a risk of future impairment charges if there is a decline in the fair value of the reporting units or indefinite-lived intangible assets as a result of, among other things, actual financial results that are lower than forecasts, an adverse change in valuation assumptions, a decline in equity valuations, increases in interest rates, or changes in the use of intangible assets. There can be no assurance that the Company’s future asset impairment testing will not result in a material charge to earnings.
2023 Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangibles Impairment and Testing
In the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the Company identified indicators of a more likely than not impairment related to its Connected Technology Solutions reporting unit, which comprises all the Connected Technology Solutions segment. The decline in fair value for this reporting unit was driven by adverse macroeconomic factors because of weakened demand, particularly in European markets, and increased discount rates. These factors contributed to reduced forecasted revenues, lower operating margins, and reduced expectations for future cash flows in the near term, particularly in relation to demand for products which are commonly financed by end customers and are therefore adversely impacted by an environment of higher interest rates. The reporting unit was evaluated for impairment using an income approach, specifically a discounted cash flow model. As a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax goodwill impairment charge for the three months ended September 30, 2023 related to the Connected Technology Solutions reporting unit of $
291
 million, resulting in a full write-off of the remaining goodwill balance for the Connected Technology Solutions segment. 
Additionally, in conjunction with the third quarter test in 2023, the Company conducted an impairment test on the indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the businesses within the Connected Technology Solutions reporting unit within the Connected Technology Solutions segment. The Company also identified an indicator of impairment for the indefinite-lived intangible assets within the Implant & Prosthetic Solutions reporting unit within the Orthodontic and Implant Solutions segment and determined certain trade names and trademarks were impaired. These indefinite-lived intangible assets were evaluated for impairment using an income approach, specifically a relief from royalty method. As a result, the Company recorded indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $
14
 million and $
2
 million for the Connected Technology Solutions and Orthodontic and Implant Solutions segments, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The impairment charge was primarily driven by macroeconomic factors such as weakened demand, higher cost of capital, and cost inflation, which are contributing to reduced forecasted revenues. 
103
2022 Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangibles Impairment and Testing
In the third and fourth quarters of 2022, the Company identified indicators of a more likely than not impairment related to its former Digital Dental Group and former Equipment & Instruments reporting units within the former Technologies & Equipment segment and certain indefinite-lived intangible assets within these former reporting units as well as the former Consumables reporting unit within the former Consumables segment. The decline in fair value for these reporting units was driven by weakened global demand, higher cost of capital, unfavorable foreign currency impacts, and increased raw material, supply chain, and service costs, which contributed to reduced forecasted revenues, lower operating margins, and reduced expectations for future cash flows. The reporting unit was evaluated for impairment using an income approach, specifically a discounted cash flow model. As a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax goodwill impairment charge related to the former Digital Dental Group and former Equipment & Instruments reporting units within the former Technologies & Equipment segment of $
1,100
 million and $
87
 million, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2022. This charge was recorded in Goodwill and intangible asset impairment in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The fair values of intangible assets were computed using either an income approach, specifically a relief from royalty method, or a qualitative assessment. As a result, the Company recorded impairment charges for its indefinite-lived intangible assets of $
66
 million and $
28
 million for the former Digital Dental Group and former Equipment & Instruments reporting units, respectively, within the former Technologies & Equipment segment, and a $
6
 million charge for the former Consumables reporting unit within the former Consumables segment, for the year ended December 31, 2022.

(a) Intangible assets acquired in a business combination that are in-process and used in R&D activities are considered indefinite-lived until the completion or abandonment of the R&D efforts. The useful life and amortization of those assets will be determined once the R&D efforts are completed.

Amortization expense for definite-lived intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $
216
 million, $
211
 million and $
209
 million, respectively. The estimated annual amortization expense related to these intangible assets for each of the five succeeding calendar years is $
204
 million, $

114
 million, $
119
 million and $
120

During the second quarter of 2021, the Company acquired certain developed technology rights for an initial payment of $
3
 million. During the fourth quarter of 2024, regulatory and commercial milestones related to the acquisition were achieved, triggering an additional payment of $
7
 million. As of December 31, 2024, the Company recognized a liability of $
10
 million for contractual future payments associated with this acquisition that were deemed probable. Both the payment and future obligation were recorded as increases to the developed technology asset for the year ended December 31, 2024.

NOTE 15 - 
EQUITY
On November 7, 2023, the Board of Directors approved an increase to the authorized share repurchase program of $
1.0
 billion. Share repurchases may be made through open market purchases, Rule 10b5-1 plans, accelerated share repurchases, privately negotiated transactions or other transactions in such amounts and at such times as the Company considers appropriate based upon prevailing market and business conditions and other factors. At December 31, 2024, the Company had authorization to repurchase $
1.2
 billion in shares of common stock remaining under the share repurchase program. 
On March 3, 2023, the Company entered into an Accelerated Share Repurchase Agreement (“ASR Agreement”) with a financial institution to repurchase the Company’s common stock. The Company repurchased shares under the ASR Agreement as part of the share repurchase program described above. In 2023, the Company repurchased approximately 
3.1
 million shares, which were delivered during March 2023, at a volume-weighted average price of $
38.74
, representing $
120
 million of the total anticipated repurchase size. In April 2023, an additional 
0.8
 million shares were delivered upon the final settlement of the ASR Agreement, resulting in a total of 
3.9
 million shares repurchased under the agreement.

The ASR Agreement was accounted for as an initial delivery of common shares in a treasury stock transaction on March 6, 2023 of $
121
 million and a forward contract indexed to the Company’s common stock for an amount of common shares that was determined on the final settlement date. The forward contract met all applicable criteria for equity classification and was not accounted for as a derivative instrument for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. Therefore, the value of the forward contract of $
30
 million was recorded in Capital in excess of par value at March 31, 2023. Upon final settlement in April 2023, this amount was subsequently recorded as Treasury Stock in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The initial delivery and final settlement of common stock reduced the weighted average common shares outstanding for both basic and diluted earnings per share. The forward contract did not impact the weighted average common shares outstanding for diluted earnings per share. 
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company repurchased outstanding shares of common stock at a cost of $
250
 million, $
300
 million and $
150
 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the treasury stock transactions resulted in an excise tax charge of $
2
 million for public company stock repurchases established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. 
For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, stock options exercised and the proceeds received at exercise were 
not
 significant. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company received proceeds of $
6
 million primarily as a result of stock options exercised in the amount of 
0.1
 million. It is the Company’s practice to issue shares from treasury stock when stock options are exercised and RSUs vest.

The Company has $
36
 million of foreign tax credit carryforwards at December 31, 2024, of which $
30
 million will expire in 2025 and $
6
 million will expire at various times from 2028 through 2031.
The Company has tax loss carryforwards related to certain foreign and domestic subsidiaries of approximately $
7,482
 million at December 31, 2024, of which $
7,214
 million expires at various times through 2044 and $
268
 million may be carried forward indefinitely. These are reflected as deferred income tax assets at December 31, 2024, and are comprised of future tax benefits o
f
 $
1,458
 million and $
96
 million, before valuation allowances, related to tax loss carryforwards and disallowed interest carryforwards, respectively. As of December 31, 2023 the Company’s deferred tax assets included 
$
873
 million of tax loss carryforwards and $
74
 million of disallowed interest carryforwards. The increase in tax loss carryforwards in 2024 is primarily the result of impairment losses.
At December 31, 2024, the Company has recorded $
1,395
 million of valuation allowance to offset the future tax benefit of net operating losses, $
29
 million to offset the future tax benefit of foreign tax credits, and $
79
 million of valuation allowance for other deferred tax assets. The Company has recorded these valuation allowances due to the uncertainty that these assets can be realized in the future. The increase in the valuation allowance is attributable to the increase in the tax loss carryforwards generated in 2024 as there is uncertainty that these assets can be realized in the future.
113
The Company has recorded $
6
 million of withholding taxes on certain undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries that the Company anticipates will be repatriated. Undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and related companies that are considered to be permanently invested amounted to $
348
 million at December 31, 2024.
Tax Contingencies
The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2024 is approximately $
137
 million, including interest, of which approximately $
51
 million represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective income tax rate. It is reasonably possible that certain amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within twelve months of the reporting date of the Company’s consolidated financial statement
s. Expiration of statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions during the next twelve months could include unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $
6
 million, which, if recognized, would affect the effective income tax rate.
The total amount of accrued interest and penalties were $
9
 million and $
4
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company has consistently classified interest and penalties recognized in its consolidated financial statements as income taxes based on the accounting policy election of the Company. The Company recognized a tax expense of $
5
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, and a tax benefit of $
2
 million in 2023 related to interest and penalties. 
The increase in unrecognized tax benefits in 2024 is primarily related to transfer pricing adjustments in certain jurisdictions, offset by a decrease from foreign currency translation.
The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. The significant jurisdictions include the United States and Germany.
 The Company has concluded all U.S. federal income tax matters for years through 2014 with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). The Company is currently under IRS audit for the tax years 2015 and 2016. The Company is under audit in Germany for the tax years 2014 through 2021. For additional information on the IRS and German audits, see Note 21, Commitments and Contingencies.

NOTE 17 - 
BENEFIT PLANS
Defined Contribution Plans
The Company maintains both U.S. and non-U.S. employee defined contribution plans. The primary U.S. plan, the Dentsply Sirona Inc. 401(k) Savings Plan (the “Plan”), allows eligible employees to contribute a portion of their cash compensation to the Plan on a tax-deferred basis, and the Company provides a matching contribution. The Plan includes various investment funds. Each eligible participant who elects to contribute to the Plan will receive a matching contribution of 
100
% on the first 1% contributed and 
50
% on the next 5% contributed for a total maximum matching contribution of 
3.5
%. At its discretion, the Company may make additional non-elective cash contributions based on a percentage of compensation to participant accounts. The Company did not make any additional non-elective cash contributions in connection with 2024 compensation. In addition to the Plan, the Company also maintains various other U.S. and non-U.S. defined contribution and non-qualified deferred compensation plans. The annual expenses, net of forfeitures, of these plans were $
34
 million, $
43
 million and $
41
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
Defined Benefit Plans
The Company maintains defined benefit pension plans for certain employees in Austria, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the United States. These plans provide benefits based upon age, years of service and remuneration. Substantially all the German and Swedish plans are unfunded book reserve plans. Most employees and retirees outside the United States are covered by government health plans.
The Company predominantly derives its discount rates by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows; or, in markets where there is an absence of a sufficiently deep corporate bond market, it uses liability durations in establishing its discount rates, which are observed from indices of high-grade corporate or government bond yield in the respective economic regions of a given plan. For the large defined benefits pension plans, the Company uses a spot rate approach for the estimation of the Service cost and Interest cost components of benefit cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows.
Significant changes in the retirement plan benefit obligations for the year ended December 31, 2024 include a $
9
 million actuarial gain primarily attributable to the increase in discount rates, the effect of which is slightly offset by a $
1
 million loss due to a change in the lump sum withdrawal rate for the Swiss plan. The changes also include a $
4
 million actuarial loss due to plan experience being different than anticipated.
Significant changes in the retirement plan benefit obligations for the year ended December 31, 2023 include a $
35
 million actuarial loss primarily attributable to the decrease in discount rates, the effect of which is slightly offset by the change in inflation and salary increase assumptions in some plans. The changes also include a $
3
 million actuarial loss due to plan experience being different than anticipated.
Defined Benefit Pension Plan Assets
The primary investment strategy is to ensure that the assets of the plans, along with anticipated future contributions, will be invested in order that the benefit entitlements of employees, pensioners and beneficiaries covered under the plan can be met when due with high probability. Pension plan assets consist mainly of common stock and fixed income investments. The target allocations for defined benefit plan assets are 
30
% to 
65
% equity securities, 
30
% to 
65
% fixed income securities, 
0
% to 
15
% real estate, and 
0
% to 
25
% in all other types of investments. Equity securities include investments in companies located both in and outside the United States. Equity securities in the defined benefit pension plans do not include Company common stock contributed directly by the Company. Fixed income securities include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, government bonds, mortgage notes and pledge letters. Other types of investments include investments in mutual funds, insurance contracts, hedge funds and real estate. These plan assets are not recorded in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as they are held in trust or other off-balance sheet investment vehicles.
The defined benefit pension plan assets maintained in Austria, Germany, Norway, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Taiwan all have separate investment policies but generally have an objective to achieve a long-term rate of return in excess of 
2
% while at the same time mitigating the impact of investment risk associated with investment categories that are expected to yield greater than average returns. In accordance with the investment policies, the plans’ assets were invested in the following investment categories: interest-bearing cash, U.S. and foreign equities, foreign fixed income securities (primarily corporate and government bonds), insurance company contracts, real estate and hedge funds.

Measurement date

To develop the assumptions for the expected long-term rate of return on assets, the Company considered the current level of expected returns on risk free investments (primarily U.S. government bonds), the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the assets are invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class. The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocations to develop the assumptions for the expected long-term rate of return on assets.
Fair Value Measurements of Plan Assets
The fair values of the Company’s pension plan assets at December 31, 2024 and 2023 are presented in the table below by asset category. Approximately 
83
% of the total plan assets are categorized as Level 1, as the values assigned to these pension assets are based on quoted prices available in active markets. For the other category levels, a description of the valuation is provided in Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, under the “Fair Value Measurement” heading.

Restructuring and other costs of $
95
 million were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2024, which consisted primarily of employee severance benefits and other costs related to the restructuring plans approved by the Board of Directors of the Company on July 29, 2024 (the “2024 Plan”) and on February 14, 2023 (the “2023 Plan”), as well as certain asset impairments resulting from the strategic actions related to the Byte aligners business beginning in October 2024 (the “Byte Realignment”).
Restructuring Plans
With the 2024 Plan, the Company seeks to improve operational performance and drive stockholder value creation. In connection with the 2024 Plan, which is expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2025, the Company anticipates a net reduction in the Company’s global workforce of approximately 
2
% to 
4
%. The proposed changes are subject to co-determination processes with employee representative groups in countries where required. Actions taken under the 2024 Plan seek to further streamline the Company’s operations and global footprint, as well as improve alignment of the Company’s cost structure with its strategic growth objectives. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has incurred $
28
 million in restructuring charges under the 2024 Plan since its inception. In total, the Company expects to incur between $
35
 million and $
50
 million in non-recurring restructuring charges under the 2024 Plan, primarily related to employee transition, severance payments, and employee benefits, which are expected to be expensed and paid in cash by the end of 2025.
With the 2023 Plan, the Company sought to restructure the business through a new operating model with 
five
 global business units, optimize central functions and overall management infrastructure, and implement other efforts aimed at cost savings. The 2023 Plan’s annual cost savings target of $
200
 million has been substantially met, with the benefits mostly offset in the short term by additional investments in sales personnel, the Company’s new global Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) system, and other transformation initiatives. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has incurred $
87
 million in restructuring charges under the 2023 Plan since its inception, primarily related to employee transition, severance payments, employee benefits, and facility closure costs, and $
20
 million in other non-recurring costs related to restructuring activities, which mostly consist of consulting, legal, and other professional service fees. Remaining restructuring charges attributable to the 2023 Plan are not expected to be material.
 The estimates of the charges and expenditures that the Company expects to incur in connection with the 2024 Plan, and the timing thereof, are subject to several assumptions, including local law requirements in various jurisdictions and co-determination aspects in countries where required. Actual amounts may differ materially from estimates. In addition, the Company may incur additional charges or cash expenditures not currently contemplated due to unanticipated events that may occur, including in connection with the implementation of the 2024 Plan.

The liabilities associated with the Company’s restructuring plans are recorded in Accrued liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Activity in the Company’s restructuring accruals at December 31, 2024 was as follows:

Byte Realignment
The changes to the Byte clear aligners business disclosed in Note 6, Segment and Geographic Information, have resulted in significant reductions in revenue forecasts and a triggering event in the fourth quarter of 2024 to evaluate the recoverability of assets attributable to Byte. The Company recorded long-term tangible asset charges, which include production equipment and capitalized software, as well as working capital for certain inventory and customer receivables specific to Byte. Additionally, the Company recorded a full impairment of the Byte trademark intangible asset.
In addition to these impairments, the Company recorded a full accrual for expected customer refunds and other reimbursement payments stemming from the cessation of sales, which resulted in a $
35
 million reduction to net sales, of which $
13
 million was paid during the three months ended December 31, 2024, with the remainder expected to be paid in 2025. 
The impact of these charges related to the Byte Realignment was as follows:

NOTE 19 - 
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVES
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
The Company’s activities expose it to a variety of market risks, which primarily include the risks related to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. These financial exposures are monitored and managed by the Company as part of its overall risk management program. The objective of this risk management program is to reduce the volatility that these market risks may have on the Company’s operating results and cash flows. The Company employs derivative financial instruments to hedge certain anticipated transactions, firm commitments, or assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Additionally, the Company utilizes interest rate swaps to convert fixed rate debt into variable rate debt or vice versa. The Company does not hold derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
The following summarizes the notional amounts of cash flow hedges, hedges of net investments, fair value hedges, and derivative instruments not designated as hedges for accounting purposes by derivative instrument type at December 31, 2024 and the notional amounts expected to mature during the next 12 months.

Cash Flow Hedges
Foreign Exchange Risk Management
The Company hedges select anticipated foreign currency cash flows to reduce volatility in both cash flows and reported earnings or losses. The Company designates certain foreign exchange forward contracts as cash flow hedges. As a result, the Company records the fair value of the contracts through AOCI based on the assessed effectiveness of the foreign exchange forward contracts. The Company measures the effectiveness of cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions on a spot-to-spot basis rather than on a forward-to-forward basis. Accordingly, the spot-to-spot change in the derivative fair value is deferred in AOCI and released and recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period that the hedged transaction is recorded. The time-value component of the fair value of the derivative is reported on a straight-line basis in Cost of products sold in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period which it is applicable. Any cash flows associated with these instruments are included in operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
These foreign exchange forward contracts generally have maturities up to 
18
 months, which is the period over which the Company is hedging exposures to variability of cash flows, and the counterparties to the transactions are typically large international financial institutions.
Interest Rate Risk Management
The Company enters into interest rate swap contracts to manage interest rate risk on long-term debt instruments and not for speculative purposes. Any cash flows associated with these instruments are included in operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
On May 26, 2020, the Company paid $
31
 million to settle the $
150
 million notional Treasury rate lock contract, which partially hedged the interest rate risk of the $
750
 million Senior Notes due June 2030. This loss is amortized over the 
ten-year
 life of the notes. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, $
16
 million and $
19
 million, respectively, of this loss is remaining to be amortized from AOCI in future periods.
AOCI Release
Overall, the derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are considered to be highly effective for accounting purposes. At December 31, 2024, the Company expects to reclassify $
3
 million of deferred net losses on cash flow hedges recorded in AOCI in the Consolidated Statements of Operations during the next 12 months. For the rollforward of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges in AOCI, see Note 5, Comprehensive Loss.
Hedges of Net Investments in Foreign Operations
The Company has significant investments in foreign subsidiaries. The net assets of these subsidiaries are exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company employs both derivative and non-derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of these exposures. The derivative instruments consist of foreign exchange forward contracts and cross-currency basis swaps. The non-derivative instruments consist of foreign currency denominated debt held at the parent company level. Translation gains and losses related to the net assets of the foreign subsidiaries are offset by gains and losses in the aforementioned instruments, which are designated as hedges of net investments, and the intrinsic value changes in these instruments are recorded on AOCI, net of tax effects. The time-value component of the fair value of the derivative instrument is amortized on a straight-line basis in Other (income) expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the applicable period. Any cash flows associated with these instruments are included in investing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, except for derivative instruments that include an other-than-insignificant financing element, for which all cash flows are classified as financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
The fair value of the foreign currency exchange forward contracts and cross-currency basis swaps is the estimated amount the Company would receive or pay at the reporting date, taking into account the effective interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The effective portion of the change in the value of these derivatives is recorded in AOCI, net of tax effects.
On July 2, 2021, the Company entered into a cross-currency basis swap of a notional amount of $
300
 million, which matures on June 3, 2030. The cross-currency basis swap is designated as a hedge of net investments. This contract effectively converts a portion of the $
750
 million bond coupon from 
3.3
% to 
1.7
%, which will result in a net reduction of Other (income) expense, net.
125
On May 25, 2021, the Company re-established its euro net investment hedge portfolio by entering into 
eight
 foreign exchange forward contracts, each with a notional amount of 
10
 million euro. The original contracts have quarterly maturity dates through March 2023 and the Company entered into additional foreign exchange contracts as individual contracts within the portfolio matured. As of December 31, 2024, the euro net investment hedge portfolio has an aggregate notional value of 
160
 million euro with maturity dates through December 2025.
On July 20, 2023, the Company entered into a Swiss franc foreign exchange forward contract designated as a net investment hedge. The foreign exchange forward contract had a notional amount of 
600
 million Swiss francs. This net investment hedge was settled in September 2023 which resulted in cash receipts totaling $
32
 million. The Company subsequently entered into Swiss franc foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges with a total notional amount of 
600
 million Swiss francs. This portfolio of contracts has semi-annual maturity dates through July 2028.
Fair Value Hedges
Foreign Exchange Risk Management
The Company has intercompany loans denominated in Swedish kronor that are exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company employs derivative financial instruments to hedge these exposures. The Company accounts for these designated foreign exchange forward contracts as fair value hedges. The Company measures the effectiveness of fair value hedges of anticipated transactions on a spot-to-spot basis rather than on a forward-to-forward basis. Accordingly, the spot-to-spot change in the derivative fair value will be recorded in Other (income) expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The time-value component of the fair value of the derivative is reported on a straight-line basis in Other (income) expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the applicable period. Any cash flows associated with these instruments are included in operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Interest Rate Risk Management
On July 1, 2021, the Company entered into variable interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $
250
 million, which effectively converted a portion of the underlying fixed rate of 
3.3
% on the $
750
 million Senior Notes due June 2030 to a variable interest rate. Of the $
250
 million notional amount, $
100
 million has a term of 
five-years
 maturing on June 1, 2026 and $
150
 million has a term of 
nine years
 maturing on March 1, 2030.
On February 13, 2024, the Company paid $
9
 million to settle the variable interest rate swap with a notional amount of $
100
 million which was originally set to mature on June 1, 2026. This closure of the interest rate swap will result in a loss of $
8
 million being amortized over the remaining life of the Senior Notes due June 2030.
Derivative Instruments Not Designated as Hedges
The Company enters into derivative instruments with the intent to partially mitigate the foreign exchange revaluation risk associated with recorded assets and liabilities that are denominated in a non-functional currency. The Company primarily uses foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge these risks. The gains and losses on these derivative transactions offset the gains and losses generated by the revaluation of the underlying non-functional currency balances and are recorded in Other (income) expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Any cash flows associated with these instruments are included in operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Gains and losses recorded in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations related to the derivative instruments not designated as hedges for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were not significant.

Balance Sheet Offsetting
Substantially all of the Company’s derivative contracts are subject to netting arrangements, whereby the right to offset occurs in the event of default or termination in accordance with the terms of the arrangements with the counterparty. While these contracts contain the enforceable right to offset through netting arrangements with the same counterparty, the Company elects to present them on a gross basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

NOTE 20 - 
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT
The estimated fair and carrying values of the Company’s total debt were $
2,037
 million and $
2,135
 million, respectively, at December 31, 2024. At December 31, 2023, the estimated fair and carrying values were $
2,018
 million and $
2,118
 million, respectively. The fair value of long-term debt is determined by discounting future cash flows using interest rates available at December 31, 2024 to companies with similar credit ratings for issuances with similar terms and maturities. It is considered a Level 2 fair value measurement for disclosure purposes.
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis

NOTE 21 - 
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Contingencies
On December 19, 2018, a putative class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York (the “EDNY Court”) against the Company and certain individual defendants. The case was narrowed following its inception. The plaintiff’s claims which, as discussed below, have now been settled in principal, are that the Company and certain individual defendants violated U.S. securities laws by making material misrepresentations and omitting required information in the December 4, 2015 registration statement filed with the SEC in connection with the 2016 merger of Sirona Dental Systems Inc. (“Sirona”) with DENTSPLY International Inc. (the “Merger”) and that the defendants failed to disclose, among other things, that a distributor had purchased excessive inventory of legacy Sirona products. In addition, the plaintiff alleges that the defendants violated U.S. securities laws by making false and misleading statements in quarterly and annual reports and other public statements between May 6, 2016 and August 7, 2018. The plaintiff asserts claims on behalf of a putative class consisting of all purchasers of the Company's stock during the period from December 8, 2015 through August 6, 2018. The Company moved to dismiss the amended complaint on August 15, 2019. The plaintiff filed its second amended complaint on January 22, 2021, and the Company filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint on March 8, 2021, with briefing on the motion fully submitted on May 21, 2021. The Company’s motion to dismiss was denied in a ruling by the EDNY Court on March 29, 2023, and the Company’s answer to the second amended complaint was filed on May 12, 2023. Following additional motion practice
—
which remained outstanding with the EDNY Court
—
and discovery, the parties engaged in settlement discussions with the assistance of a mediator, and, in January 2025, reached a settlement in principal to resolve the case in full for $
84
 million, of which the Company expects to receive an offsetting insurance receivable of approximately $
78
 million while paying the rest in cash. A binding term sheet for the settlement has been signed, which is subject to negotiation and approval by the EDNY Court of a full settlement agreement. The excess of the settlement liability as of December 31, 2024 over the corresponding insurance policy receivable resulted in $
6
 million of legal expense which was recorded during the period.
On June 2, 2022, the Company was named as a defendant in a putative class action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio captioned City of Miami General Employees’ & Sanitation Employees’ Retirement Trust v. Casey, Jr. et al., No. 2:22-cv-02371, and on July 28, 2022, the Company was named as a defendant in a putative class action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (the “SDNY Court”) captioned San Antonio Fire and Police Pension Fund v. Dentsply Sirona Inc. et al., No. 1:22-cv-06339 (together, the “Securities Litigation”). The complaints in the Securities Litigation are substantially similar and both allege that, during the period from June 9, 2021 through May 9, 2022, the Company, Mr. Donald M. Casey Jr., the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Jorge Gomez, the Company’s former Chief Financial Officer, violated U.S. securities laws by, among other things, making materially false and misleading statements or omissions, including regarding the manner in which the Company recognized revenue tied to distributor rebate and incentive programs. On March 27, 2023, the Court in the Southern District of Ohio ordered the transfer of the putative class action to the SDNY Court. On June 1, 2023, the SDNY Court consolidated the two separate actions under case No. 1:22-cv-06339 and appointed as lead plaintiffs for the putative class the City of Birmingham Retirement and Relief System, the El Paso Firemen & Policemen’s Pension Fund, and the Wayne County Employees’ Retirement System (collectively, the “Lead Plaintiffs”). Lead Plaintiffs filed an amended class action complaint on July 28, 2023 (the “Amended Complaint”). In addition to asserting the same claims against the Company, Mr. Casey, and Mr. Gomez, the Amended Complaint added the Company’s former Chief Accounting Officer, Mr. Ranjit S. Chadha, as a defendant (collectively, “Defendants”). On October 10, 2023, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint. Lead Plaintiffs’ opposition to Defendants’ motion to dismiss was filed on December 8, 2023, and Defendants’ reply was filed on January 8, 2024. The motion to dismiss was granted as to Mr. Chadha and granted in part and denied in part as to the Company, Mr. Casey, and Mr. Gomez in a ruling by the SDNY Court on May 1, 2024. The Company’s answer to the Amended Complaint was filed on May 21, 2024. On November 15, 2024, Lead Plaintiffs filed a motion to certify the matter as a class action, to appoint Lead Plaintiffs as class representatives, and to appoint Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP as class counsel. Defendants’ opposition to Lead Plaintiffs’ motion was filed on December 20, 2024, and Lead Plaintiffs’ reply is due on February 28, 2025.
In addition to the Securities Litigation, as previously disclosed, the Company voluntarily contacted the SEC following the Company’s announcement on May 10, 2022 of the internal investigation by the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors. The Company continues to cooperate with the SEC regarding this matter. 
Separately, on July 13, 2023, Dentsply Sirona stockholder George Presura filed a stockholder derivative suit in the Delaware Court of Chancery captioned George Presura, Derivatively on Behalf of Nominal Defendant Dentsply Sirona Inc. v. Donald M. Casey Jr. et al. and Dentsply Sirona, Inc., No. 2023-0708-NAC (the “Presura Derivative Litigation”). The complaint, filed derivatively on behalf of the Company, asserts claims against current and former members of the Company’s Board of Directors and current and former executive officers, including Messrs. Casey and Gomez. The derivative complaint in 
133
this case contains allegations similar to those in the Securities Litigation, and it alleges that during the period from June 9, 2021 through July 13, 2023, various of the defendants breached fiduciary duties, committed corporate waste, and misappropriated information to conduct insider trading by making materially false and misleading statements or omissions regarding the Company’s recognition of revenue tied to distributor rebate and incentive programs and distributor inventory levels. On August 4, 2023, the Delaware Court of Chancery stayed the Presura Derivative Litigation until the earlier of public announcement of a settlement of the Securities Litigation or resolution of the pending motion to dismiss in the Securities Litigation.
Additionally, on March 26, 2024, Dentsply Sirona stockholder Calvin Snee filed a stockholder derivative suit in the Delaware Court of Chancery captioned Calvin Snee, derivatively on behalf of Dentsply Sirona Inc. v. Donald M. Casey Jr., et al. and Dentsply Sirona Inc, No. 2024-0308 (the “Snee Derivative Litigation”). The complaint, filed derivatively on behalf of the Company, asserts claims against current and former members of the Company’s Board of Directors and current and former executive officers, including Messrs. Casey and Gomez. The derivative complaint in this case contains allegations similar to those in the Presura Derivative Litigation and the Securities Litigation, and it alleges that beginning in 2021, various of the defendants breached fiduciary duties, misappropriated information to conduct insider trading, and were unjustly enriched by making materially false and misleading statements or omissions regarding the Company’s recognition of revenue tied to distributor rebate and incentive programs and distributor inventory levels.
On May 2, 2024, the Delaware Court of Chancery issued an order consolidating and staying the Presura Derivative Litigation and Snee Derivative Litigation.
On July 19, 2024, Dentsply Sirona stockholder Frank Manfre filed a stockholder derivative suit in the Delaware Court of Chancery captioned Frank Manfre, derivatively on behalf of nominal defendant Dentsply Sirona Inc. v. Donald M. Casey Jr. et al. and Dentsply Sirona Inc., No. 2024-0763 (the “Manfre Derivative Litigation”). The complaint asserts claims against current and former members of the Company’s Board of Directors and current and former executive officers, including Messrs. Casey and Gomez. The complaint in this case contains allegations similar to those in the Snee Derivative Litigation, the Presura Derivative Litigation, and the Securities Litigation, and it alleges that beginning in 2021, various of the defendants breached fiduciary duties, misappropriated information to conduct insider trading, and were unjustly enriched by making materially false and misleading statements or omissions regarding the Company’s recognition of revenue tied to distributor rebate and incentive programs and distributor inventory levels.
On September 19, 2024, the Delaware Court of Chancery issued an order consolidating and staying the Manfre Derivative Litigation, Presura Derivative Litigation, and Snee Derivative Litigation. 
On November 26, 2024, the Company was named as a defendant in a putative class action filed in the SDNY Court captioned North Collier Fire Control and Rescue District Firefighters’ Retirement Plan v. Dentsply Sirona Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-09083 (the “North Collier Action”). On December 18, 2024, the Company was named as a defendant in a putative class action filed in the SDNY Court captioned Calvin v. Dentsply Sirona Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-09764 (the “Calvin Action”), and on December 19, 2024, the Company was named as a defendant in a putative class action filed in the SDNY Court captioned Key West Police & Fire Pension Fund v. Dentsply Sirona Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-09819 (the “Key West Action”). The complaints in these three cases allege that, for different alleged class periods over the period from May 6, 2021 through November 6, 2024, the Company and certain current and former officers violated U.S. securities laws by, among other things, making materially false and misleading statements or omissions, including regarding the performance of the Company’s Byte aligners business, following the Company’s acquisition of Byte LLC in December 2020. On February 21, 2025, the SDNY Court entered an order consolidating the North Collier Action, the Calvin Action, and the Key West Action under the caption In re Dentsply Sirona, Inc. Securities Litigation, No. 24-cv-9083, and appointing HANSAINVEST Hanseatische Investment-Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung and City of Miami General Employees’ & Sanitation Employees’ Retirement Trust as lead plaintiffs (“Lead Plaintiffs”) and Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann LLP as lead counsel for the consolidated case. The SDNY Court ordered the Lead Plaintiffs to file an amended complaint by April 7, 2025. 
On March 21, 2023, Mr. Carlo Gobbetti filed a claim in the Milan Chamber of Arbitration against Dentsply Sirona Italia S.r.l. (“DSI”), Italy, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, seeking a total of €
28
 million for the alleged failure to pay a portion of the purchase price pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement, dated October 8, 2012 (the “SPA”), in which Sirona Dental Systems, S.r.l., which at the time of execution of the SPA was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sirona Dental Systems, Inc., acquired all of the shares of MHT S.p.A., an Italian corporation, from Mr. Gobbetti, and various other sellers. Sirona Dental Systems S.r.l. merged into Dentsply Italia S.r.l. in 2018 (the surviving entity is now Dentsply Sirona Italia S.r.l.). Under the SPA, a portion of the purchase price equal to €
7
 million was required to be deposited into an escrow account (the “Escrow Account”) and released to Mr. Gobbetti and the other sellers upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the delivery by July 2013 of a new prototype of an MHT S.p.A. camera which had to meet certain specifications. In connection with the 
134
closing of the share purchase transaction, the SPA was supplemented by a Facility Agreement, also dated October 8, 2012 (the “FA”), which specifically set out the mechanics of payment and release of the proceeds of the Escrow Account. The Austrian notary public, Mr. Gottfried Schachinger, acting as escrow agent, Mr. Gobbetti, and SIRONA Holdings GmbH, an affiliate of Sirona Dental Systems, Inc. which paid the €
7
 million into the Escrow Account, were parties to the FA. The FA is subject to Austrian law and to the jurisdiction of the Court of Salzburg in Austria.
Mr. Gobbetti claims that he is entitled to receive the €
7
 million outstanding balance of the purchase price under the SPA, plus €
21
 million for damages incurred as a consequence of the failure to make the payment. Mr. Gobbetti claims that he has a right to receive the full purchase price under the SPA even if the conditions set out in the SPA to deliver a prototype of the MHT S.p.A. camera by July 2013 were not met. On May 15, 2023, DSI filed its initial statement of defense denying that Mr. Gobbetti and the other sellers were entitled to receive the funds deposited in the Escrow Account and further disputing the allegations. Following the constitution of the arbitral tribunal, hearings were held on September 13, 2023 and January 19, 2024, to illustrate and discuss the positions of the parties. The parties also developed their arguments in several rounds of defensive briefs. The final submissions were completed on April 15, 2024 and the final hearing for discussion took place on May 8, 2024. On July 22, 2024, the arbitral tribunal rejected all of Mr. Gobbetti’s claims, ruling that the Company had met its contractual obligations under the SPA, particularly regarding the balance of the purchase price. The arbitral tribunal also dismissed Mr. Gobbetti’s claims in tort and those pertaining to the FA for lack of jurisdiction and lack of capacity for the Company to be sued. The arbitral tribunal observed that such claims should have been brought against SIRONA Holdings GmbH, which is a party to the FA but not to the SPA, before the Court of Salzburg in Austria based on the jurisdictional clause of the FA.
Mr. Gobbetti appealed the ruling of the arbitral tribunal on December 2, 2024 before the Court of Appeals of Milan, Italy (the “Court of Appeals”) arguing that the ruling is null and void. According to Mr. Gobbetti, the arbitral tribunal did not grant him appropriate defense rights under the Italian Civil Code and did not fully address the merits of his claims, despite acknowledging jurisdiction. Mr. Gobbetti asked the Court of Appeals to directly sentence DSI to pay the €
7
 million, plus damages of €
21
 million. DSI must submit its defense by March 20, 2025.
Except as noted above, no specific amounts of damages have been alleged in these lawsuits. The Company will continue to incur legal fees in connection with these pending cases, including expenses for the reimbursement of legal fees of present and former officers and directors under indemnification obligations. The expense of continuing to defend such litigation may be significant. The Company intends to defend these lawsuits vigorously, although the Company may elect to settle certain litigation matters, but there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in any defense or that matters can be settled on terms favorable to the Company. If any of the lawsuits are decided adversely, the Company may be liable for significant damages directly or under its indemnification obligations, which could adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and cash flows. At this stage, the Company has accrued losses which are deemed probable, along with related insurance receivables, but the Company is unable to assess whether any incremental material loss or adverse effect is reasonably possible as a result of these lawsuits or estimate the range of any potential loss.
The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) is conducting an examination of the Company’s U.S. federal income tax returns for the tax years 2015 and 2016. The Company received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment in April 2023 and a Revenue Agent Report in January 2024 from the IRS examination team proposing an adjustment related to an internal reorganization completed in 2016 with respect to the integration of certain operations of Sirona Dental Systems, Inc. following its acquisition in 2016. Although the proposed adjustment does not result in any additional federal income tax liability for the internal reorganization, if sustained, the proposed adjustment would result in the Company owing additional federal income taxes on a distribution of $
451
 million related to a stock redemption that occurred after the internal reorganization was completed in 2016. The proposed adjustment, if sustained, would also result in a loss of foreign tax credits carried forward to later tax years. The Company believes that it accurately reported the federal income tax consequences of the internal restructuring and stock redemption in its tax returns and in April 2024, submitted an administrative protest with the IRS Independent Office of Appeals contesting the examination team’s proposed adjustments. The IRS examination team provided the Company with a rebuttal to the Company’s administrative protest during August 2024 and informed the Company that the dispute would be forwarded to the IRS Independent Office of Appeals. 
The General Public Prosecutor’s Office Frankfurt am Main is investigating a series of intercompany loans implemented in 2016 and 2017 as part of the post-merger integration activities of DENTSPLY International Inc. and Sirona Dental Systems, Inc. The Company is cooperating with the investigation. The Company believes that the transactions at issue complied with all applicable German laws. No charges have been filed against the Company or any individuals.
The Company intends to vigorously defend its positions and pursue related appeals in the above-described pending matters and believes it is more likely than not that its positions will be sustained, although the Company may elect to settle certain matters. Unless otherwise disclosed herein, the Company has not accrued losses for these matters because the Company does 
135
not believe the risk of loss is probable and cannot estimate the range of any potential loss with any reasonable degree of accuracy.
In addition to the matters disclosed above, the Company is, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation and similar proceedings incidental to its business. These legal matters primarily involve claims for damages arising out of the use of the Company’s products and services and claims relating to intellectual property matters including patent infringement, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes, competition and sales and trading practices, personal injury, and insurance coverage. The Company may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions or as a result of liabilities retained from, or representations, warranties or indemnities provided in connection with, divested businesses. Some of these lawsuits may include claims for punitive and consequential, as well as compensatory, damages. Except as otherwise noted, the Company generally cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the above-described pending matters will be, what the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters will be, or what the eventual loss, fines or penalties related to each pending matter may be. Based upon the Company’s experience, current information, and applicable law, it does not believe that these proceedings and claims will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. However, in the event of unexpected further developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, or other similar matters, if unfavorable, may be materially adverse to the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.
While the Company maintains general, product, property, workers’ compensation, automobile, cargo, aviation, crime, fiduciary and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance up to certain limits that cover certain of these claims, this insurance may be insufficient or unavailable to cover such losses. In addition, while the Company believes it is entitled to indemnification from third parties for some of these claims, these rights may also be insufficient or unavailable to cover such losses.
Commitments
Purchase Commitments
The Company has certain non-cancelable future commitments primarily related to long-term supply contracts for key components and raw materials. At December 31, 2024, non-cancelable purchase commitments were as follows:

The table above includes commitments under the Company’s agreement with a cloud services provider supporting the Company’s digital platform which requires minimum purchases totaling $
85
 million through 2028.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had no material off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources other than certain items disclosed in the sections above.
Indemnification
In the normal course of business to facilitate sales of the Company’s products and services, the Company indemnifies certain parties, including customers, vendors, lessors, services providers, and others, with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, services to be provided by or for the Company, and intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and its executive officers that will require the Company, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their 
136
status or service as directors or officers. Several of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim.
It is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of indemnification under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the Company has a limited history of prior indemnification claims, and the payments made under such agreements have not had a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Except as noted in the “Contingencies” section herein, as of December 31, 2024, the Company did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by the Company could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows in a particular period.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
None.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The Company’s management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, who is also serving as the Company’s principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of
 December 31, 2024, the end of the period covered by this report, were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that it is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Management’s report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and the report of our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting are included under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
The Company is implementing a new enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system using a global platform. The implementation is underway and is expected to continue to occur in phases over the next several years. In connection with the ERP implementation, we are updating and will continue to update our internal control over financial reporting, as necessary, to accommodate modifications to our business processes and accounting procedures. In the quarter ended December 31, 2024, the Company implemented the ERP system for a legal entity in the United States. The Company has appropriately considered this change in its design of and testing for effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting and concluded this implementation did not have an adverse effect, nor do we expect will have an adverse effect, on our internal control over financial reporting.
Except with respect to the continued implementation of the new ERP system, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

We will continue to evaluate any further changes in our internal control over financial reporting over the course of the implementation of the new ERP system and other related systems, which is scheduled to occur in phases over the next few years.
