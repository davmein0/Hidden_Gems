The contractual obligations we have disclosed do not include any potential development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments and potential royalty payments that we may be required to make under the various license agreements entered into by Centessa. We excluded these payments given that the timing of any such payments cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.
Incentivization Agreements
In January 2021, we established incentivization arrangements (as novated, amended or amended and restated from time to time) pursuant to which certain members of the senior management teams of each subsidiary we had acquired in January 2021 are eligible to earn certain payments based on the attainment of corresponding milestone performance by and/or an exit event of such subsidiary, as applicable to each executive. As defined in the incentivization agreements, an “exit event” includes the sale or disposition (including via an out-licensing) of all or substantially all of the applicable subsidiary’s commercially valuable assets or, in the case of subsidiaries with more than one asset, sale or disposition of one or more of such assets, or any sale or disposition  of the applicable subsidiary’s equity which results in the purchaser of the equity acquiring a controlling interest in the applicable subsidiary. Milestones may include the designation of a product candidate or the attainment of approvals, licenses, permits, certifications registrations or authorizations necessary for the sale of a particular product candidate or related molecules in the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Spain or the United Kingdom. Each milestone payment amount for each subsidiary is in the low eight figure range to be divided among the members of the respective subsidiary’s senior management team and employees according to the terms of its respective incentivization agreement. Any milestone payment earned will be payable in a lump sum within twenty (20) days after attainment of the milestone. In addition, if a sale of a controlling interest in a subsidiary or sale (or grant of an exclusive license) of its respective product candidate occurs prior to attainment of the milestone or within the three (3) year period following attainment of the milestone, an exit payment equal in the range of single digit to low teens percentage of the sales proceeds less any amounts previously paid as a milestone payment (if any) and any fees, costs and expenses of the sale (excluding any earn out, milestone, royalty payment or other contingent payments but including any escrow, holdback or similar amount) will become due and payable to certain employees and members of the subsidiary’s senior management team. To the extent an exit event occurs following the occurrence of an adverse event (which includes the failure to achieve milestones within the specified time period), no exit payment will become due unless sale proceeds are in excess of an amount in the eight-figure range. As of December 31, 2024, incentivization agreements in respect of Centessa Bioscience, Inc. (formerly Palladio Bioscience, Inc.), Capella Bioscience Limited, Centessa Pharmaceuticals (Morphogen-IX) Limited (formerly Morphogen-IX Limited), Pearl River Bio and, Pega-One SAS and Centessa Pharmaceuticals (UK) Limited have ceased to apply.  
The incentivization agreements contain standard termination provisions providing that the agreements shall terminate upon the occurrence of certain events, or automatically on December 31, 2035. Other events that may trigger termination include: 
•
an exit event; 
•
the occurrence of certain asset sales in conjunction with certain milestones; and
•
the date that is three years following achievement of certain milestones.
Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status 
We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. Other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements under the JOBS Act for emerging growth companies include presentation of only two years of audited financial statements in a registration statement for an initial public offering, an exemption from the requirement to provide an auditor’s report on internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, an exemption from any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation and less extensive disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements. We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date that (i) we are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) we affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of our first fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.235 billion or more, (ii) December 31, 2026, the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the closing of our initial public offering, (iii) the date on which we are deemed to be a

“large accelerated filer,” under the rules of the SEC, which means the market value of equity securities that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the prior June 30th and (iv) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.
We are also a “smaller reporting company” as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). If we are still a smaller reporting company at the time we cease to be an emerging growth company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company we may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and, similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation.

Item 8. Financial Statements
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
Centessa Pharmaceuticals plc:
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Centessa Pharmaceuticals plc and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

1. 
Organization and Description of Business
Centessa Pharmaceuticals plc (“Centessa” or “the Company”) is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company that aims to discover, develop and ultimately deliver medicines that are transformational for patients. Centessa was incorporated on October 26, 2020 as a limited liability company under the laws of England and Wales. In connection with the IPO in June 2021, the Company re-registered Centessa Pharmaceuticals Limited as an English public limited company and renamed it as Centessa Pharmaceuticals plc. 
Risks and Liquidity
The Company is subject to risks common to other life science companies in early stages of development including, but not limited to, uncertainty of product development and commercialization, lack of marketing and sales history, development of new technological innovations by its competitors, dependence on key personnel, market acceptance of products, product liability, protection of proprietary technology, ability to raise additional financing and compliance with government regulations, in the markets in which the Company is seeking approvals, including FDA regulations. If the Company does not successfully advance its programs into and through human clinical trials and/or enter into collaborations for its programs and commercialize any of its product candidates, it may be unable to produce product revenue or achieve profitability.
The Company has incurred losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and the Company had an accumulated deficit o
f $
988.7
 million
 as of December 31, 2024. The Company anticipates incurring additional losses until such time, if ever, that it can generate significant sales of the product candidates currently in development. Substantial additional capital will be needed by the Company to fund its operations and to develop its product candidates. 
On December 30, 2024, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement (the “Loan and Security Agreement”) with Oxford Finance LLC (“Oxford”), as collateral agent and a lender, and the other lenders from time to time party thereto (collectively, the “Lenders”), pursuant to which the Lenders have agreed to lend the Company an aggregate principal amount of up to $
200.0
 million in a series of term loans (the “Term Loans”).
Pursuant to the Loan and Security Agreement, the Company received $
110.0
 million (the “Initial Term Loan”) and incurred $
1.1
 million of debt issuance costs inclusive of facility and legal fees. The Company has access to up to an additional $
40.0
 million of loan proceeds in an additional tranche which is available during the period commencing on the date of the occurrence of the Clinical Milestone (as defined in the Loan and Security Agreement) through the earlier of: (i) 
90
 days following the Clinical Milestone and (ii) June 30, 2028. An additional $
50.0
 million may be made available to the Company at the Lenders’ sole discretion.
The term loans are set to mature on December 1, 2029 and, following an interest-only period, will begin to amortize in equal monthly installments beginning on February 1, 2029. However, if the Extension Event as defined in the Agreement occurs, then at the Company’s option, the term loans could begin to amortize in equal monthly installments beginning on February 1, 2030, and the maturity date will be extended to December 1, 2030.
Substantially all of the proceeds from the Initial Term Loan were used to repay in full the approximately $
110
 million aggregate principal amount outstanding, accrued interest and fees related to the Company’s existing note purchase agreement (the “NPA”) with Three Peaks Capital Solutions Aggregator Fund and Cocoon SA LLC, an affiliate of Oberland Capital Management LLC (collectively, “Oberland Capital”). 
(See - Note 5  
"Debt"
).
Shelf Registration Statement and Equity offerings
On September 11, 2024, the Company filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR (“Shelf”) registering an unspecified amount of the Company’s ordinary shares, American Depository Shares representing ordinary shares, debt securities, warrants, and/or units or any combination thereof with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Shelf automatically became effective upon filing. Under the Shelf, Centessa may offer securities from time to time in one or more offerings, at prices and on terms to be determined by market conditions at the time of offering. The specifics of any future offerings, along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered, will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement, or other offering materials, at the 
125

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
time of any offering. The Company’s prior shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which was declared effective by the SEC on July 12, 2022, covered the offering, issuance and sale of an amount up to $
350.0
 million in the aggregate of the Company’s ordinary shares, American Depository Shares representing ordinary shares, debt securities, warrants, and/or units or any combination thereof.
The Company entered into a Sales Agreement, dated January 27, 2023, by and between Centessa Pharmaceuticals plc and Leerink Partners LLC (formerly SVB Securities LLC). As sales agent, Leerink Partners LLC will provide for the issuance and sale by the Company of up to $
125.0
 million of its ordinary shares represented by American Depository Shares (“ADSs”) from time to time in “at-the-market” offerings (“ATM Program”). In the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company sold 
1,250,000
 ordinary shares under the ATM Program, resulting in net proceeds of $
9.7
 million. On a life to date basis, as of December 31, 2024, the Company has sold 
4,290,816
 ordinary shares under the ATM Program, resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately 
$
30.5
 million
.
In 2024, the Company completed offerings of its ordinary shares 
through the sale and issuance of a cumulative 
29,932,626
 ADSs. Each ADS represents 
one
 ordinary share with a nominal value of £
0.002
 per ordinary share. 
The completed offerings, which included the Underwriters’ over-allotment option to purchase additional shares, was made pursuant to the Shelf registration. The net proceeds of these offerings, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, was approximately 
$
349.9
 million
. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offerings, together with its existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, to fund the continued development of its product candidates, as well as for general corporate purposes.
The Company expects its existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments 
as of December 31, 2024 of $
482.2
 million 
will be sufficient to fund its expected operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 
12
 months from the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements.

2. 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation and Consolidation 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Any reference in these notes to applicable guidance is meant to refer to GAAP as found in the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) and Accounting Standards Updates (“ASUs”) promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
In the opinion of management, the accompanying consolidated financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments (which consist primarily of accruals, estimates and assumptions that impact the financial statements) considered necessary to present fairly:
•
the Company’s financial position as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023; and
•
the Company’s results of operations and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.
Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company
The Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”) enacted in April 2012. For so long as the Company remains an emerging growth company, it is permitted and intends to rely on certain exemptions from various public company reporting requirements, including not being required to have our internal control over financial reporting audited by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 
The Company will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier to occur of (1) the last day of the fiscal year that is five years following the closing of our initial public offering, (2) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of at least $1.235 billion, (3) the last day of the fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a 
126
Table of Contents
Centessa Pharmaceuticals plc
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
“large accelerated filer,” under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, which means the market value of our equity securities that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th 
after we have been subject to the SEC’s periodic reporting requirements for at least twelve calendar months and have filed at least one annual report,
 and (4) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.
In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This provision allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of some accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We are electing to utilize the extended transition period and, as a result, will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for emerging growth companies.
The Company is also a “smaller reporting company” as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”). Even after the Company no longer qualifies as an emerging growth company, it may still qualify as a “smaller reporting company” if the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates is below $250 million (or $700 million if our annual revenue is less than $100 million) as of June 30 in any given year. As a smaller reporting company, we are eligible for scaled disclosure relief from certain Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K requirements. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include cash in readily available checking accounts, certificate of deposits, money market funds and U.S. Treasury securities.
Short Term Investments
The Company invests its excess cash in cash deposits, U.S. Treasury securities and SEC-registered money market funds. Securities with original maturities of three months or less when purchased are included in Cash and cash equivalents. The Company considers investments with original maturities greater than three months and remaining maturities less than one year to be short-term investments. 
As of December 31, 2024, all investments in U.S. Treasury securities were classified as available-for-sale securities, which are recorded at fair value. Unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are reported net of related income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive income until realized. Purchase premiums and discounts are amortized to interest income over the terms of the related securities.

Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. The Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are held by financial institutions primarily in the United States and the United Kingdom. Amounts on deposit may at times exceed federally insured limits. Management believes that the financial institutions are financially sound, and accordingly, the Company does not believe that it is subject to unusual credit risk beyond the normal credit risk associated with commercial banking relationships.
Segments
Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise with separate discrete information available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. We view our operations and manage our business as 
one
 segment.
Reclassifications
Certain amounts in the prior period financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation of the current period financial statements. These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported net loss or comprehensive loss.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Foreign Currency Translation
The Company’s financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars (“USD”), the reporting currency of the Company. The functional currency of Centessa Pharmaceuticals plc is USD and the functional currency of the Centessa Subsidiaries is their respective local currency. Income and expenses have been translated into USD at average monthly exchange rates prevailing during the period. Assets and liabilities have been translated at the rates of exchange on the balance sheets dates and equity accounts at their respective historical rates. The resulting translation gain and loss adjustments are recorded directly as a separate component of shareholders’ equity as other comprehensive (loss) income. 
Transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are remeasured based upon the exchange rate at the date of remeasurement with the resulting gain or loss included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss within Other income (expense), net.
  The aggregate foreign currency transaction gain or loss is included in the results of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded a net foreign currency transaction loss of $
1.8
 million, while for the year ended December 31, 2023, it recorded a net foreign currency transaction gain of $
0.8
 million
.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Estimates and assumptions are periodically reviewed and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary. Significant areas that require management’s estimates include accrued research and development expenses, the note purchase agreement, share-based compensation and tax-related matters.
Property and Equipment, net
Property and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Property and equipment includes computer equipment, furniture and office equipment, which have a useful life of 
three
 to 
seven years
. The costs of maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Improvements and betterment that add new functionality or extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized.
 Depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $
0.3
 million in each year.
Capitalized software as a service costs representing costs incurred during the application development stage are included in “Other non-current assets” and the corresponding current portion, in “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” and is amortized using the straight line method over 
5
 years. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage and the post-implementation-operation stage are expensed as incurred. Hosting fees associated with the hosting as a service arrangement are expensed on a straight line basis over the term of the hosting arrangement.

Amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 
2023 
was $
0.6
 million and 
$
0.5
 million
, respectively.
Leases
In accordance with 
ASU No. 2016-02, 
Leases (“ASC 842”)
, the Company assesses whether an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease at the inception of the arrangement. When an arrangement contains a lease, the Company categorizes leases with contractual terms longer than twelve months as either operating or finance. Finance leases are generally those leases that allow us to substantially utilize or pay for the entire asset over its estimated life. Assets acquired under finance leases are recorded in “Property and equipment, net.” All other leases are categorized as operating leases.
The Company records right-of use ("ROU") assets and lease obligations for its finance and operating leases, which are initially recognized based on the discounted future lease payments over the term of the lease. As the rate implicit in the Company's leases may not be easily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to calculate the present value of the sum of the lease payments. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. The Company will include such options in determining the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will 
128
Table of Contents
Centessa Pharmaceuticals plc
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
exercise such options. Operating and finance lease ROU assets are recognized net of any lease prepayments and incentives. The Company elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components and, accordingly, accounts for them as a single lease component. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Finance lease expense is recognized based on the effective-interest method over the lease term. The Company elected not to recognize ROU assets and lease obligations for any short-term leases, which are defined as leases with an initial term of 12 months or less.
Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, then an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. As of December 31, 2024, the Company believes that no revision of the remaining useful lives or write-down of long-lived assets is required.
Fair Value Measurement
Fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Fair value determination in accordance with applicable accounting guidance requires that a number of significant judgments be made. Additionally, fair value is used on a nonrecurring basis to evaluate assets for impairment or as required for disclosure purposes by applicable accounting guidance on disclosures about fair value of financial instruments. Depending on the nature of the assets and liabilities, various valuation techniques and assumptions are used when estimating fair value. The carrying amounts of certain of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, prepaid expense and accounts payable, are shown at cost, which approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The Company follows the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 820,
 Fair Value Measurement
, for financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis. The guidance requires fair value measurements be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:
Level 1:    
Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.
Level 2:
    Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liabilities.
Level 3:    
Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e., supported by little or no market activity).
Debt Issuance Costs
For debt issuances that are not accounted for under the fair value option, such as the Loan and Security Agreement, any debt issuance costs are capitalized, recorded as an offset to the Company’s debt balances and amortized as interest expense over the term of the associated debt instrument using the effective interest method. If the maturity of the debt is accelerated as a result of default or early debt repayment, the amortization would then be accelerated. Amounts paid related to debt financing activities are presented on the consolidated balance sheet as a direct deduction from the debt liability.
For debt issuances that are accounted for under the fair value option, such as the Note Purchase Agreement, discussed further below, any debt issuance costs are expensed at the time of issuance in accordance with ASC 825
, Financial Instruments.
Note Purchase Agreement
In October 2021, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the “NPA”) with Oberland Capital, which was subsequently repaid in full on December 30, 2024 using the proceeds of the Loan and Security Agreement with Oxford. 
As described in further detail in Note 5 - 
"Debt"
,
 in addition to the repayment of the principal as well as quarterly interest payments
, the Company was obligated to pay a Milestone payment equal to 
30
%
 of the aggregate principal amount 
129
Table of Contents
Centessa Pharmaceuticals plc
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
issued under the Notes by the Company upon regulatory approval of any drug candidate. 
The Company may redeem all, but not less than all, of the outstanding notes (if any) and pay all other outstanding obligations under the NPA. On the applicable date, the Company shall repurchase the notes by paying an amount of up to (i) 
185
% of the principal amount issued under the notes if such repurchase occurs between the third and sixth anniversaries of the First Purchase Date, and (ii) 
205
% of the principal amount issued under the notes if such repurchase occurs thereafter, in each case less specified deductions and exclusions described in the NPA, including amounts paid by the Company to the Purchasers in respect of certain asset sale or strategic transactions, the interest payments and the Milestone Payments (the “Final Payment Amount”).
The Company evaluated the notes under the NPA and determined that the notes include embedded derivatives that would otherwise require bifurcation as derivative liabilities. Neither the debt instrument nor any embedded features are required to be classified as equity. Therefore, the hybrid financial instrument comprised of the debt host and the embedded derivative liability may be accounted for under the fair value option. The Company elected to carry the notes at fair value, and the debt instrument is outside the scope of ASC 480, 
Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity
, and thus is classified as a liability under ASC 470, 
Debt
, in the Company’s financial statements. As the Company has elected to account for the notes under the fair value option, debt issuance costs were immediately expensed.
The fair value of the notes under the NPA represents the present value of estimated future payments, including interest, principal as well as estimated payments that are contingent upon the achievement of specified milestones. The fair value of the notes was based on the cumulative probability of the various estimated payments. The fair value measurement was based on significant Level 3 unobservable inputs such as the probability of achieving the milestones, anticipated timelines, probability and timing of an early redemption of all obligations under the agreement and the discount rate. Any changes in the fair value of the liability in each reporting period are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss until it was settled.
License and other revenue
The Company recognizes revenues from collaboration, license or other research or sale arrangements when or as performance obligations are satisfied. For milestone payments, the Company assesses, at contract inception, whether the milestones are considered probable of being achieved. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal will occur, the Company will not record revenue until the uncertainty has been resolved. Milestone payments that are contingent upon regulatory approval are not considered probable until the approvals are obtained as it is outside of the control of the Company. If it is probable that significant revenue reversal will not occur, the Company will estimate the milestone payments using the most likely amount method. The Company reassesses the milestones each reporting period to determine the probability of achievement. Any potential consideration received in the form of royalty or sales-based milestones will be  recorded when the customer’s subsequent sales or usages occur.
Collaborative Arrangements
The Company enters into collaborative arrangements to develop and commercialize intellectual property. These arrangements typically involve two (or more) parties who are active participants in the collaboration and are exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the activities. These collaborations usually involve various activities by one or more parties, including research and development, marketing and selling and distribution. Often, these collaborations require upfront, milestone and royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Amounts due to collaborative partners related to development activities are generally reflected as research and development expense.
Research and Development Expenses and Accruals
All research and development costs are expensed in the period incurred and consist primarily of salaries, payroll taxes, employee benefits, stock-based compensation charges for those individuals involved in research and development efforts, external research and development costs incurred under agreements with contract research organizations and consultants to conduct and support the Company’s ongoing clinical trials.
The Company has entered into various research and development contracts with clinical research organizations, clinical development and manufacturing organizations and other companies. Payments for these activities are based on the 
130
Table of Contents
Centessa Pharmaceuticals plc
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
terms of the individual agreements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred.  Payments made in advance of performance are reflected in the accompanying balance sheets as prepaid expenses, while payments made after performance are reflected as accrued liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets. The Company records accruals for estimated costs incurred for ongoing research and development activities. When recording accruals for ongoing research and development activities, the Company analyzes progress of the services, including the phase or completion of events, invoices received and contracted costs. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services, including fees for process development or manufacturing and distribution of clinical supplies that will be used in future research and development activities, are recognized as expense in the period that the related goods are consumed or services are performed.  
Milestone payments within the Company’s licensing arrangements are recognized when achievement of the milestone is deemed probable to occur. To the extent products are commercialized and future economic benefit has been established, commercial milestones that become probable are capitalized and amortized over the estimated remaining useful life of the intellectual property. Significant judgments and estimates may be made in determining the prepaid or accrued balances at the end of any reporting period. Actual results could differ from the Company’s estimates.
Research and Development Tax Incentives
The Company participates in research tax incentive programs that are granted to companies by the United Kingdom tax authorities in order to encourage them to conduct technical and scientific research. Expenditures that meet the required criteria are eligible to receive a tax credit that is reimbursed in cash, upon surrender of loss carryforwards. Estimates of the amount of the cash refund expected to be received are determined at each reporting period and recorded as reductions to research and development expenses. The Company recorded research and development tax incentives of $
30.9
 million 
and $
24.3
 million 
during the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.
Through December 31, 2024, the Company claimed relief under the Small and Medium Enterprise (“SME”) scheme. Beginning January 1, 2025, changes to the program in the UK have aligned the tax incentives earned for SME and large entities. The merged scheme provides relief for qualifying R&D expenditure. If the company is loss making, a cash credit can be obtained. If the company continues to meet the SME thresholds and is loss making, then a higher rate of credit may be available under the new Enhanced R&D Intensive Support (ERIS). The Company expects eligible R&D expenditures qualifying for the credit outside of the UK will be more limited as a result of these legislative changes and it expects to recognize less tax incentives in the United Kingdom.
Share-Based Compensation
The Company measures share-based awards, including restricted shares, restricted stock units and stock options, at their grant-date fair value and records compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the awards. The Company determines the fair value of share-based compensation awards using the market closing price of the Company’s ADSs on the date of grant. 
F
orfeitures of stock options are recognized in the period the forfeiture occurs.
The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value its stock option awards. The expected life of the stock options is estimated using the “simplified method,” as the Company has limited historical information from which to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns and post-vesting employment termination behavior for its stock option grants. The simplified method is the midpoint between the vesting period and the contractual term of the option. For share price volatility, the Company uses comparable public companies as a basis for its expected volatility to calculate the fair value of option grants. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve commensurate with the expected life of the option.  
The estimated annual dividend yield is 
0
% because the Company has not historically paid and does not expect for the foreseeable future to pay a dividend on its ordinary shares.

Retirement Plans
The Company provided defined contribution plans to its employees beginning in 2021. In the U.S., the primary plan sponsored by the Company is a safe harbor, 401k plan with a 
4
% employer match, no waiting period and immediate vesting on the match.  In the UK, the primary plan sponsored by the Company is a money purchase plan, which requires a minimum 
8
% contribution, including a minimum employer contributio
n of 
4
% and employee contribution of 
4
%
.
 The Company recorded charges of $
0.7
 million under these plans during the year ended December 31, 2024 and $
0.6
 million during the year ended December 31, 2023.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Income Taxes
The Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under ASC 740, 
Income Taxes
. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that included the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
The Company regularly assesses its ability to realize its deferred tax assets. Assessing the realization of deferred tax assets requires significant judgment. In determining whether its deferred tax assets are more likely than not realizable, the Company evaluated all available positive and negative evidence, and weighed the evidence based on its objectivity. After consideration of the evidence, the Company believes it would more likely than not be able to utilize existing loss carryforwards and research and development tax credits to offset future income in the United States. The operating entity in the United States has a history of cumulative net profits as it carries out services for other entities in the group and recognizes most of the interest income earned from cash, cash equivalents and short term investments. 
ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. The Company is subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities since inception.
Net Loss Per Ordinary Share
Basic loss per ordinary share is computed by dividing net loss by the aggregate weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding. Diluted loss per ordinary share includes the effect, if any, from the potential exercise or conversion of securities, such as stock options, unvested restricted ordinary shares and restricted stock units which would result in the issuance of incremental ordinary shares. For diluted net loss per ordinary share, the weighted-average number of ordinary shares is the same for basic net loss per ordinary share due to the fact that when a net loss exists, dilutive securities are not included in the calculation as the impact is anti-dilutive.
The following potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from the computation of diluted weighted-average ordinary shares outstanding, as they would be anti-dilutive.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Recognition Disclosures. This ASU will require entities to provide enhanced disclosures related to certain expense categories included in income statement captions. The ASU aims to increase transparency and provide investors with more detailed information about the nature of expenses reported on the face of the income statement. The new standard does not change the requirements for the presentation of expenses on the face of the income statement. Under this ASU, entities are required to disaggregate, in a tabular format, expense captions presented on the face of the income statement - excluding earnings or losses from equity method investments - if they include any of the following expense categories: purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, intangible asset amortization, and depreciation or depletion. For any 
132
Table of Contents

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
remaining items within each relevant expense caption, entities must provide a qualitative description of the nature of those expenses. The new ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on the related disclosures.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. This ASU does not change accounting for income taxes but requires new disclosures focusing on two areas, the effective rate reconciliation and taxes paid. This new standard is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on the related disclosures.

Loan and Security Agreement
On December 30, 2024 (the “Effective Date”), the Company entered into a loan and security agreement (the “Loan and Security Agreement”) with Oxford Finance LLC (“Oxford”), as collateral agent and a lender, and the other lenders from time to time party thereto (collectively, the “Lenders”), pursuant to which the Lenders have entered an agreement to lend the Company an aggregate principal amount of up to $
200
 million in a series of term loans (the “Term Loans”).
Pursuant to the Loan and Security Agreement, the Company received $
110.0
 million (the “Initial Term Loan”) and incurred $
1.1
 million of debt issuance costs inclusive of facility and legal fees. The Company has access to up to an additional $
40.0
 million of loan proceeds in an additional tranche which is available during the period commencing on the date of the occurrence of the Clinical Milestone (as defined in the Loan and Security Agreement) through the earlier of: (i) 
90
 days following the Clinical Milestone and (ii) June 30, 2028. An additional $
50.0
 million may be made available to the Company at the Lenders’ sole discretion.
The term loans are set to mature on December 1, 2029 and, following an interest-only period, will begin to amortize in equal monthly installments beginning on February 1, 2029. However, if the Extension Event as defined in the Agreement occurs, then at the Company’s option, the term loans could begin to amortize in equal monthly installments beginning on February 1, 2030, and the maturity date will be extended to December 1, 2030.
The term loans accrue interest at a floating rate equal to (i) secured overnight financing rate for a one-month tenor from the website of the CME Group Benchmark Administration Limited, subject to a floor of 
3.28
%, plus (ii) an applicable margin of 
5.00
%. The Loan and Security Agreement provides for a minimum interest rate of 
8.28
% and a maximum interest rate of 
10.50
%. Interest on the term loans is payable monthly in arrears. The term loans once repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed. The term loans may be prepaid in full at the option of the Company. The Company is required to pay a prepayment fee of 
3.00
% for prepayments of term loans made in the first year after funding of such term loans, 
2.00
% for prepayments of term loans made in the second year after funding of such term loans and 
1.00
% for prepayments thereafter. The Company is also obligated to pay other customary fees for a loan facility of this size and type, including a final payment of 
5.00
% of principal (the “End of Term Charge”).
Substantially all of the proceeds from the Initial Term Loan were used to repay in full the approximately $
110
 million aggregate principal amount outstanding interest and fees related to the Company’s existing note purchase agreement (the “NPA”) with Three Peaks Capital Solutions Aggregator Fund and Cocoon SA LLC, an affiliate of Oberland Capital Management LLC (collectively, “Oberland Capital”).
The Company’s obligations under the Loan and Security Agreement are guaranteed by the Company and certain subsidiaries of the Company and will be guaranteed by the Company’s future subsidiaries, subject to certain customary limitations pursuant to the terms of the English-law Guarantee and Indemnity (the “Guarantee”). In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Loan and Security Agreement, the Company granted Oxford, as collateral agent, a first priority security interest in substantially all of the Company’s shares and assets, including intellectual property. Furthermore, pursuant to the terms of the English-law debenture entered into on the Effective Date (the “Debenture”), the Company and certain of its subsidiaries granted Oxford a first priority security interest in substantially all of the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ assets, including intellectual property.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
The Loan and Security Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants limiting the ability of the Company and their subsidiaries to, among other things, dispose of assets, incur debt, grant liens, pay dividends and distributions on their capital stock, make investments and acquisitions, and enter into transactions with affiliates, in each case subject to customary exceptions for a loan facility of this size and type. In addition, commencing on October 1, 2026, the Loan and Security Agreement contains a minimum cash covenant the Company must at all times maintain: (1) 
35
% of the outstanding aggregate principal balance of the Term Loan; and (2) up to 
80
% of the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan based on the Company’s orexin agonist program Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical data and continued Active Development (as defined in the Loan and Security Agreement) of its lead orexin asset programs; provided that such minimum cash covenants shall not be tested during periods when the Company’s ADSs are listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market and its market capitalization meets $
1.0
 billion.
The events of default under the Loan Agreement include, among others, payment defaults, material misrepresentations, breaches of covenants, cross defaults with certain other material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency events, the occurrence of a Material Adverse Change (as defined in the Loan and Security Agreement) and judgment defaults. The occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of the Company’s obligations under the Loan and Security Agreement, the termination of the Lenders’ commitments, a 
3
% increase in the applicable rate of interest and the exercise by the Lender of other rights and remedies provided for under the Loan Agreement.

Note Purchase Agreement
On October 1, 2021, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the “NPA”) with Oberland Capital Management LLC (the “Purchasers”). On October 4, 2021, a secured note in the principal amount of

$
75
 million was  funded. In addition to the repayment of the principal as well as quarterly interest payments
, the Company was obligated to pay a Milestone payment equal to 
30
%
 of the aggregate principal amount issued under the Notes by the Company upon regulatory approval of any drug candidate. T
he Company was obligated to redeem all, but not less than all, of the outstanding notes (if any) and pay all other outstanding obligations under the NPA. On the applicable repayment date, the Company was required to repurchase the notes by paying an amount of up to (i) 
185
% of the principal amount issued under the notes if such repurchase occurs between the third and sixth anniversaries of the First Purchase Date, and (ii) 
205
% of the principal amount issued under the notes if such repurchase occurs thereafter, in each case less specified deductions and exclusions described in the NPA, including amounts paid by the Company to the Purchasers in respect of certain asset sale or strategic transactions, the interest payments and the Milestone Payments (the “Final Payment Amount”).
As of December 31, 2024, all of the outstanding obligations under the NPA were extinguished. The Company used the proceeds from the Loan and Security Agreement to pay off remaining obligations on the NPA. The Company recognized a loss on the extinguishment of this debt of $
34.1
 million.

required the Company to issue a letter of credit in the amount of $
0.7
 million in favor of the landlord. 
The Company may, at its discretion, extend the Boston Lease for 
one
 extension term of 
five years
.

Licensing
 and Collaborative Arrangements
The Company is party to licensing and collaboration arrangements to develop and commercialize intellectual property. 
Included in research and development expense in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss for 
year ended December 31, 2024
 were aggregate incurred expenses of 
$
4.8
 million
, primarily reflecting development milestone costs. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had 
no
 licensing and collaborative arrangement milestone obligations recorded on its balance sheet. 
License Agreement with Nxera Pharma UK Limited (formerly Heptares Therapeutics Limited) in connection with Orexin Program
The Company is party to a license, assignment, and research services agreement with Nxera Pharma UK Limited (“Nxera”), relating to certain specific molecules with, among other criteria, the primary mode of action of an orexin agonist or orexin positive modulator (“Molecules”). Under the agreement, Nxera assigned to the Company all of Nxeras’ right, title, and interest in and to intellectual property that is already in existence and that is developed as a result of the agreement that relates solely to Molecules or products that contain Molecules (“Products”), including all rights to obtain patent or similar protection throughout the world for such intellectual property and to take any and all actions regarding past infringements of existing intellectual property. Additionally, Nxera granted to the Company an exclusive, sublicensable (subject to certain terms) license to make, import, export, use, sell, or offer for sale, including to development, commercialization, registration, modification, enhancement, improvement, manufacturing, holding, keeping 
139
Table of Contents

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
or disposing of Molecules and Products. Nxera must not by itself or through a third party (other than a single company) exploit, use or dispose of (
inter alia
) any product in the field of orexin agonism and orexin positive modulation for the duration of the agreement and for 
three years
 thereafter.
In consideration for the assignment and license, the Company is to pay Nxera a royalty in the low single-digits on net sales of Products (subject to limitations in certain scenarios). Royalties are on a Product-by-Product and country-by country basis. Payments shall commence with the first commercial sale of such product in a country and shall continue until the later of: (a) the duration of regulatory exclusivity in the country; or (b) 
10
 years after the first commercial sale. Further, the Company is responsible for all development costs incurred by itself or Nxera in the performance of the research program (within the confines of the research budget). Additionally, the Company must pay Nxera, on a Molecule-by-Molecule basis, development milestone payments in the aggregate of a low double-digit number in the millions of pounds sterling. Milestone payments are payable once per Molecule. The Company anticipates paying between the low single digits millions of pounds sterling to low double digit millions of pounds sterling in the next twelve months.
The Company may terminate the agreement at any time following the expiration or termination of the research program. In addition, customary termination rights exist for both parties for breach and insolvency. In the event of termination, all licenses automatically terminate. The term of the agreement is until the later of: (i) the expiration of the last to expire patent within the licensed intellectual property; (ii) the expiration of the royalty term; and (iii) the fifteenth anniversary of the effective date. Upon expiration, with respect to any given Molecule, the license granted to the Company shall become perpetual, irrevocable, and fully-paid up. 
Other License and Collaboration Agreements
The Company is a party to other license and collaboration agreements to develop and commercialize intellectual property in addition to the agreement discussed above. In aggregate, Centessa is obligated to make up to $
4.3
 million and $
15.0
 million in development and commercial milestone payments, respectively, related to these other agreements.
Contingencies
From time to time, the Company may have certain contingent liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities. The Company accrues a liability for such matters when it is probable that future expenditures will be made, and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated. Legal charges incurred in connection with contingencies and litigation are expensed as incurred.
Litigation
On September 28, 2022 (“Original Complaint”), the Company and certain of its current and former officers were named as defendants in a proposed class-action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The complaint generally alleges that the Company violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) and Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) by allegedly making materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as allegedly failing to disclose material adverse facts relating to the safety profile and future clinical and commercial prospects of each of its lixivaptan and ZF874 programs, which caused the Company’s securities to trade at artificially inflated prices. On October 12, 2022, by order, the lawsuit was transferred to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. On February 10, 2023, an amended complaint was filed (“Amended Complaint”) in which our IPO underwriters were added as co-defendants. A number of the claims set forth in the Original Complaint were abandoned including with respect to intentional fraud theory and claims pursuant to Sections 10(b) or 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The only claims alleged in the Amended Complaint were violations of Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act based on alleged misstatements in the S-1 filed by the Company in connection with its Initial Public Offering. The Amended Complaint also abandoned any claims concerning ZF874 and focuses entirely on lixivaptan. The Amended Complaint sought unspecified damages and attorneys’ fees, among other things. On August 23, 2023, the Company submitted its motion to dismiss all claims. On August 2, 2024, Judge Gregory Wood of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted in full a motion to dismiss with leave for the plaintiff to amend within 
twenty-one days
 certain statements and no leave to amend other statements and no ability to expand the scope of the claims pleaded in the Amended Complaint. On August 27, 2024, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissed the plaintiff’s complaint with prejudice and ordered the case closed.

Program Termination Costs
On November 12, 2024, the Company announced the discontinuation of the global clinical development program for SerpinPC, a novel inhibitor of activated protein C (APC) that was being progressed for the treatment of hemophilia B. The strategic decision was made to prioritize capital towards the development of our growing OX2R agonist franchise based on the strength of the interim Phase 1 data for ORX750, coupled with the outcome of a planned interim analysis of Part 1 of the PRESent-2 study of SerpinPC, which was evaluated in the context of the evolving treatment and market landscape for hemophilia B, including the recent FDA approval of a competing product. 
As a result of the discontinuation of the program, we incurred a one-time charge of $
31.5
 million, consisting of contract termination costs of $
30.3
 million and employee severance related costs of $
1.2
 million, which was recorded within Research and development expenses. The contract termination costs related to firm commitments for the manufacture of registrational materials and other costs. The contract termination and employee severance costs associated with this program discontinuation were predominately accrued as of December 31, 2024 and are expected to be paid in the first half of 2025.

The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value its stock option awards. The expected life of the stock options is estimated using the “simplified method,” as the Company has limited historical information from which to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns and post-vesting employment termination behavior for its stock option grants. The simplified method is the midpoint between the vesting period and the contractual term of the option. For share price volatility, the Company uses comparable public companies as a basis for its expected volatility to calculate the fair value of option grants. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve commensurate with the expected life of the option.  Forfeitures of stock options are recognized in the period the forfeiture occurs.
Restricted Share Awards and Units
In 2021, the Company issued 
1,213,802
 ordinary shares subject to future vesting under its Restricted Stock Awards program. The fair value of the awards are based upon the estimated fair value of the Company’s ordinary shares at the time of grant.

The Company regularly assesses its ability to realize its deferred tax assets. Assessing the realization of deferred tax assets requires significant judgment. In determining whether its deferred tax assets are more likely than not realizable, the Company evaluated all available positive and negative evidence, and weighed the evidence based on its objectivity. After consideration of the evidence, including the Company's history of cumulative net losses in the U.K., the Company has concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefits of its U.K. deferred tax assets and accordingly the Company has provided a valuation allowance for the full amount of the net deferred tax assets in the U.K. The Company has considered the history of cumulative net profits in an operating entity in the United States, which carries out services for other entities in the group and recognizes most of the interest income from cash, cash equivalents and short term investments, and estimated that entity’s future taxable income and concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of the deferred tax assets in that entity, and has not provided a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets in that entity. For the 
year ended December 31, 2024
, the consolidated valuation allowance increased by $
21.7
 million.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, the consolidated valuation allowance decreased by $
20.6
 million, primarily reflecting the release of a valuation allowance following an internal reorganization of subsidiaries in the U.S. in 2023

UK income tax returns from 2022 remain open for examination and UK NOLs do not expire. In the U.S., income tax returns from 2021 and later remain open for examination and unutilized U.S. NOLs and credit carryforwards are subject to examination until utilized. If not utilized prior to the specified dates, U.S. federal NOLs totaling $
3.2
 million and a U.S. R&D tax credit carryforward of $
11.1
 million would expire starting in 2036 and $
38.8
 million of U.S. state NOLs would expire beginning in 2036.

in Code) that could limit the Company’s ability to utilize these carryforwards, in relation to its principal operating unit in the U.S. Pursuant to Section 382 of the Code, an ownership change occurs when the stock ownership of a 5% stockholder increases by more than 50% over a three-year testing period. The Company’s U.S. entities may have experienced various ownership changes, as defined by the Code, as a result of past financings and may in the future experience an ownership change. Accordingly, the Company’s ability to utilize the aforementioned carryforwards may be limited.

Subsequent Event
On February 14, 2025, Centessa Pharmaceuticals (UK) Limited (“Centessa”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Centessa Pharmaceuticals plc (the “Company”), entered into a License Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with Genmab A/S (“Genmab”) pursuant to which Centessa granted to Genmab an exclusive worldwide license to leverage the Company’s proprietary LockBody platform to research products against up to 
three
 undisclosed targets during a multi-year research period, with option to take up to 
three
 exclusive commercial licenses for worldwide development and commercialization of products against each selected target. Genmab will be conducting all research and development activities under the License Agreement and the products may combine Centessa’s LockBody technology with Genmab’s proprietary antibody technologies. The LockBody technology platform is designed to improve the therapeutic index of therapies by allowing the conditional activation of potent cell killing mechanisms in diseased tissue, but not in non-diseased tissue.
Under the terms of the License Agreement, Centessa will receive an upfront payment of $
15
 million and option exercise fees potentially totaling up to an additional $
15
 million and is eligible to receive potential payouts of up to $
234
 million in development, regulatory and sales milestones per product, as well as tiered royalties ranging in the mid single-digits on annual global net licensed product sales. 
The License Agreement includes various representations, warranties, covenants, indemnities, and other customary provisions. Unless earlier terminated in accordance with its terms, the License Agreement will expire upon expiration of the last royalty term for the last licensed product. Genmab may terminate the License Agreement or on a target-by-target basis for convenience upon specified time periods. On a target-by-target basis, if Genmab elects not to exercise its option for an exclusive commercial license for worldwide development and commercialization of products against the applicable target (a “Reserved Target”), then the License Agreement will automatically terminate with respect to such Reserved

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, respectively), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of
 December 31, 2024. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. 
Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2024. Our management has concluded that the f
inancial statements included in this report present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with GAAP.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company in accordance with Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the (i) effectiveness and efficiency of operations, (ii) reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and (iii) compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Our internal controls framework is based on the criteria set forth in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework that was issued in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (our principal executive officer, and principal accounting officer and principal financial officer, respectively), we evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
 December 31, 2024. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm
This Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm due to an exemption for “emerging growth companies.”
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
No changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the three m
onths ended December 31, 2024 that has m
aterially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Narrative to 2024 Summary Compensation Table 
Base Salaries 
The annual base salaries for Dr. Saha, Mr. Crowley and Mr. Hussain for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 were $671,611, $525,000 and 
£
383,399, respectively. Additionally, our Compensation Committee reviews the base salaries of our executive officers, including our named executive officers, from time to time and makes recommendations for adjustments for approval by our Board of Directors as it determines to be reasonable and necessary to reflect the scope of the executive officer’s performance, contributions, responsibilities, experience, prior salary level, position (in the case of a promotion) and market conditions, including base salary amounts relative to similarly situated executive officers at peer group companies.
Bonuses 
We have granted cash bonuses to our key executives, including the named executive officers, pursuant to the Company’s Senior Executive Cash Incentive Bonus Plan (the “Incentive Plan”). The Incentive Plan provides for bonus payments based upon the attainment of performance objectives established by the Compensation Committee and related to individual and financial and operational metrics with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries. In 2024, our board of directors considered certain goals in determining annual bonuses, including: advancement of individual program 
157
Table of Contents
development goals, 
establishment of high performance teams, infrastructure and corporate governance framework and achievement of financial budget goals. 
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, the target annual bonuses for Dr. Saha, Mr. Crowley and Mr. Hussain were 60%, 40% and 40%,

respectively, of the applicable named executive officer’s annual base salary. As indicated above, the bonus amount paid to Mr. Crowley was pro-rated based on his June 2024 start date pursuant to his employment agreement.
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, the Compensation Committee, at their discretion, determined that bonuses would be paid at 134% of target based on NEOs’ performance and achievement of corporate goals and objectives.
Equity Compensation
Our equity-based incentive awards are designed to align our interests and the interests of our stockholders with those of our NEOs. In addition, we believe that equity grants promote executive retention because they incentivize our executive officers to remain in our employment during the vesting period. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, we granted restricted stock units and stock option awards to Dr. Saha and Mr. Hussain and stock option awards to Mr. Crowley, as described in more detail in the “Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal 2024 Year-End” table. These grants are subject to our 2021 Stock Option and Incentive Plan.
Perquisites or Personal Benefits
Perquisites or other personal benefits are not a significant component of our executive compensation program. Accordingly, we do not provide significant perquisites or other personal benefits to our executive officers, including our named executive officers.
Retirement Plans
In the U.S., we maintain a tax-qualified retirement plan (the “401(k) Plan”) that provides eligible U.S. employees with an opportunity to save for retirement on a tax-advantaged basis. Plan participants are able to defer eligible compensation subject to applicable annual Internal Revenue Code limits. We provide matching contributions under the 401(k) Plan up to the IRS limits. In 2024, we provided a matching contribution of 4% of compensation to plan participants. The 401(k) Plan is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code with the 401(k) Plan’s related trust intended to be tax exempt under Section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. As a tax-qualified retirement plan, contributions to the 401(k) Plan and earnings on those contributions are not taxable to the employees until distributed from the 401(k) Plan.
In the UK, we maintain a Group Personal Pension Scheme through Aviva (“Group Plan”), in which UK employees are automatically enrolled. We make an employer contribution equivalent to 4% of employee basic annual salary to participants. Participating employees are required to make an employee contribution of 4% of basic annual salary. The Group Plan is a Qualifying Workplace Pension Scheme, providing that the employee meets the following requirements: Aged 22 and above, earning over £10,000 per annum, ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom. 
Centessa’s scheme is a ‘defined contribution’ arrangement. This means that contributions from both the employee and the employer are deposited into the employee’s plan. The employee decides how to invest this money during scheme membership, then use the amount built up in the plan to provide benefits upon retirement. Contributions are taken from net salary (after calculation of tax and national insurance). Centessa then pays the contribution to Aviva, who will automatically add basic rate tax relief of 20% to the employee’s contribution (to replace the taxes already deducted during payroll.). 
Executive Employment Arrangements
We have entered into an offer letter or employment agreement with each of the named executive officers, which set forth the terms and conditions of their employment. Each named executive officer has also entered into our standard proprietary information and inventions agreement.

Executive Severance Plan
In June 2021, our board of directors adopted an Executive Severance Plan, or the Severance Plan, in which our named executive officers, and certain other executives, participated. The severance terms outlined in the employment agreements entered into w
ith Dr. Saha in March 2022 and Mr. Crowley in June 2024
 supersede the terms outlined in the Severance Plan for these named executive

officers as of the effective date of such employment agreements (as further described above).
The Severance Plan provides that upon a termination by us for any reason other than for “cause,” as defined in the Severance Plan, death or “disability,” as defined in the Severance Plan, or resignation for “good reason”, as defined in the Severance Plan, in each case outside of the change in control period (i.e., the period of one year after a “change in control,” as defined in the Severance Plan), an eligible participant will be entitled to receive, subject to the execution and delivery of an effective release of claims in favor of the Company and continued compliance with all applicable restrictive covenants, (i) 12 months of “base salary” (i.e., the higher of the annual base salary in effect immediately prior to the date of termination or the annual base salary in effect for the year immediately prior to the year in which the date of termination occurs) for our Chief Executive Officer, 12 months for Tier 2 officers (which is determined by the plan administrator and includes the named executive officers other than the Chief Executive Officer) and 6 months for Tier 3 officers (which is determined by the plan administrator) and (ii) 12 months of benefits continuation for our Chief Executive Officer, 12 months of benefit continuation for Tier 2 officers and 6 months of benefit continuation for Tier 3 officers. The payments under (i) and (ii) will be paid in substantially equal installments in accordance with our payroll practice over 12 months for our Chief Executive Officer, 12 months for Tier 2 officers and 6 months for Tier 3 officers. 
The Severance Plan also provides that upon a (A) termination by us other than for cause, death or disability or (B) resignation for good reason, in each case within the change in control period, an eligible participant will be entitled to receive, in lieu of the payments and benefits above and subject to the execution and delivery of an effective release of claims in favor of the Company and continued compliance with all applicable restrictive covenants, (I)(a) a lump sum amount equal to 18 months of base salary and 150% of the target annual bonus in effect immediately prior to the date of termination (or immediately prior to the change in control, if higher) and 18 months of benefits continuation for our Chief Executive Officer, (b) 12 months of the base salary and 100% of the target annual bonus in effect immediately prior to the date of termination (or immediately prior to the change in control, if higher) and 12 months of benefits continuation for our Tier 2 officers and (c) 9 months of the base salary and 75% of the target annual bonus in effect immediately prior to the date of termination (or immediately prior to the change in control, if higher) and 9 months of benefits continuation for our Tier 3 officers, and (II) for all outstanding and unvested equity awards of the Company that are subject to time-based vesting held by the participant, full accelerated vesting of such awards; provided, that the performance conditions applicable to any outstanding and unvested equity awards subject to performance-based vesting will be deemed satisfied at the target level specified in the terms of the applicable award agreement. 
The payments and benefits provided under the Severance Plan in connection with a change in control may not be eligible for a federal income tax deduction by us pursuant to Section 280G of the Code. These payments and benefits may also subject an eligible participant, including the named executive officers, to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code. If the payments or benefits payable in connection with a change in control would be subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code, then those payments or benefits will be reduced if such reduction would result in a higher net after-tax benefit to the participant. 
Compensation Risk Assessment 
We believe that although a portion of the compensation provided to our executive officers and other employees is performance-based, our executive compensation program does not encourage excessive or unnecessary risk taking. This is primarily due to the fact that our compensation programs are designed to encourage our executive officers and other employees to remain focused on both short-term and long-term strategic goals, in particular in connection with our pay-for-performance compensation philosophy. As a result, we do not believe that our compensation programs are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us. 
Compensation Recovery Policy
On October 26, 2022, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) adopted regulations (the “final rules”) implementing Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), which was added by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. New Exchange Act Rule 10D-1 required U.S. national stock exchanges, including Nasdaq, to adopt new listing standards that will require listed companies to adopt and 
160
Table of Contents
comply with policies that provide for the recovery of incentive-based compensation received by current or former executive officers based on any misstated financial reporting measure if the company is required to prepare an accounting restatement. This so-called compensation recovery or “clawback” policy must provide for recovery of the amount of pre-tax incentive-based compensation received during the three-year period preceding the date the company is required to prepare the accounting restatement that exceeds the amount that would have been received based on the restated financial reporting measure, subject to very limited exceptions for instances in which recovery would be impracticable. For incentive-based compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return, which must be covered by the clawback policy, the amount of compensation to be recovered must be based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the accounting restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return upon which the incentive-based compensation was received. On June 9, 2023, the SEC approved, on an accelerated basis, the Nasdaq’s proposed listing standards implementing the SEC’s Dodd-Frank rules covering the recovery of erroneously awarded compensation. The listing standards become effective on October 2, 2023. 
In October, 2023, in compliance with the rules issued by the SEC under the Exchange Act, and the Nasdaq Stock Market. the Company adopted a Compensation Recovery Policy which provides that if the Company makes compensation awards to executive officers and/or certain other senior employees of the Company (collectively, “Officers”) based on achievement of certain financial measures (e.g., revenue, stock price performance), and then later needs to restate its financial statements, then the Company is required to recover from such Officers the excess compensation that they would not have been entitled to if there had been no restatement. The Compensation Recovery Policy is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors.
Awards under the annual bonus and the Amended and Restated 2021 Stock Option and Incentive Plan made after the 2022 AGM are subject to malus and clawback provisions which permit the compensation committee of the Board of Directors (the “Compensation Committee”), in its discretion, to reduce the size (including to zero) of any future bonus or share award granted to an Executive Director, to reduce the size (including to zero) of any granted but unvested share award. The circumstances in which the Company may apply the malus and clawback provisions are the discovery of a material misstatement of financial results, a miscalculation or error in assessing the performance condition applying to the award, or in the event of serious misconduct committed by the executive director.
In respect of cash bonus payments, the malus and clawback provisions apply for one year from the date of payment of the bonus (or, if later, the date of publication of the Company’s financial results for the year following the relevant year over which the bonus was earned).
In respect of share awards under the Amended and Restated 2021 Stock Option and Incentive Plan, malus and clawback provisions apply up until the first anniversary of the date on which the relevant award vests, although the Compensation Committee may extend this period for a further two years if there is an ongoing investigation into the circumstances of any event that, if determined to have occurred, would permit the Compensation Committee to operate the malus and clawback provisions.

The Initial Grant will vest in 36 equal monthly installments over three years from the grant date, subject to continued service as a director through the applicable vesting date.

Such awards are subject to full accelerated vesting upon the sale of the company.

We will reimburse all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by non-employee directors in attending meetings of the board of directors and committees thereof.

None of our executive officers currently serves, or in the past fiscal year has served, as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving on our board of directors or compensation committee.

Indemnification Agreements 
We have entered into a deed of indemnity with those executive officers who are not directors. These agreements and our articles of association require us to indemnify our executive officers against certain liabilities and expenses incurred by such persons in connection with claims made by reason of their being such an executive officer to the fullest extent permitted by law. 
In addition, pursuant to the acquisition by certain individuals associated with Medicxi of ordinary shares in Centessa Pharmaceuticals plc (f/k/a Centessa Pharmaceuticals Limited) in November 2020, Medicxi Ventures (UK) LLP entered into a deed of indemnity with Centessa, under the terms of which Medicxi Ventures (UK) LLP will indemnify Centessa against certain potential liabilities for employment-related tax that may arise as a result of or in connection with the acquisitions by any such individuals. 
In addition, we have previously entered into deeds of indemnity with our directors. These agreements will, among other things, indemnify our directors against certain liabilities and expenses incurred by such persons in connection with claims made by reason of their being such a director to the fullest extent permitted by law. 
Registration Rights 
On January 29, 2021, we entered into a Registration Rights Agreement, as amended to date, which we refer to as our registration rights agreement, with certain holders of our outstanding convertible preferred shares and our ordinary shares, including entities with which certain of our directors are affiliated. Pursuant to the registration rights agreement, certain holders of our ordinary shares issued upon the conversion of our convertible preferred shares and all ordinary shares held by the entities affiliated with Medicxi and the entities affiliated with Index Ventures (the “Registrable Securities”) are entitled to rights with respect to the registration of these securities under the Securities Act. The registration rights agreement includes demand registration rights, short-form registration rights and piggyback registration rights. 
Demand Registration Rights 
Beginning on November 23, 2021, the holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities then outstanding are entitled to demand registration rights. Under the terms of the registration rights agreement, we will be required, upon the written request of holders of a majority of these securities to file a registration statement, with respect to at least 40% of the Registrable Securities then outstanding (or a lesser percentage, if the anticipated aggregate offering price would exceed $10.0 million) and use best efforts to effect the registration of all or a portion of these shares for public resale. We are required to effect only two registrations pursuant to this provision of the registration rights agreement. 
Short-Form Registration Rights 
Pursuant to the registration rights agreement, if we are eligible to file a registration statement on Form F-3 or Form S-3, upon the written request of holders of at least 10% of the Registrable Securities then outstanding having an anticipated aggregate offering price of at least $4.0 million, we will be required to effect a registration of such Registrable 
168
Table of Contents
Securities. We are required to effect only two registrations in any twelve-month period pursuant to this provision of the registration rights agreement. The right to have such shares registered on Form F-3 or Form S-3 is further subject to other specified conditions and limitations. 
Piggyback Registration Rights 
Pursuant to the registration rights agreement, if we register any of our securities either for our own account or for the account of other security holders, other than in connection with our initial public offering or a registration for any employee benefit plan, corporate reorganization, or the offer or sale of debt securities, the holders of the Registrable Securities (for so long as they are a party to the registration rights agreement) are entitled to include their shares in the registration. Subject to certain exceptions contained in the registration rights agreement, we and the underwriters may limit the number of Registrable Securities included in the underwritten offering to the number of shares which we and the underwriters determine in our sole discretion will not jeopardize the success of the offering. 
Indemnification 
Our registration rights agreement contains customary cross-indemnification provisions, under which we are obligated to indemnify holders of registrable securities in the event of material misstatements or omissions in the registration statement attributable to us, and they are obligated to indemnify us for material misstatements or omissions attributable to them and (iii) the closing of a share sale. 
Expiration of Registration Rights 
The registration rights granted under the registration rights agreement will terminate on the earlier of (i) June 2, 2025, which is the fourth anniversary of the completion of the initial public offering (ii) such time as all relevant ordinary shares may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 without limitation during a 90 day period without registration.  
Related Person Transaction Policy 
We have adopted a written related party transactions policy that such transactions must be approved by our audit committee. Pursuant to this policy, the audit committee has the primary responsibility for reviewing and approving or disapproving “related person transactions,” which are transactions between us and related persons in which the related person has a direct or indirect material interest. For purposes of this policy, a related person will be defined as a director, executive officer, nominee for director, or greater than 5% beneficial owner of any class of our voting securities, and their immediate family members. 
Director Independence
Rule 5605 of the Nasdaq Listing Rules requires a majority of a listed company’s board of directors to be comprised of independent directors within one year of listing. In addition, the Nasdaq Listing Rules require that, subject to specified exceptions, each member of a listed company’s audit, compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees be independent and that Audit Committee members also satisfy independence criteria set forth in Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act. Under Rule 5605(a)(2), a director will only qualify as an “independent director” if, in the opinion of our board of directors, that person does not have a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. In order to be considered independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3, a member of an Audit Committee of a listed company may not, other than in his or her capacity as a member of the board of directors, the Audit Committee or any other board committee, accept, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee from the listed company or any of its subsidiaries or otherwise be an affiliated person of the listed company or any of its subsidiaries.
Our board of directors has determined that all members of the board of directors, except Saurabh Saha M.D., Ph.D. are independent, as determined in accordance with the rules of Nasdaq and relevant federal securities laws and regulations. In making such independence determination, our board of directors considered the relationships that each such non-employee director has with us and all other facts and circumstances that the board of directors deemed relevant in determining their independence.
