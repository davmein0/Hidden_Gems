Item 3. Legal Proceedings
On September 28, 2022 (“Original Complaint”), the Company and certain of its current and former officers were named as defendants in a proposed class-action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The complaint generally alleges that the Company violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) and Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) by allegedly making materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as allegedly failing to disclose material adverse facts relating to the safety profile and future clinical and commercial prospects of each of its lixivaptan and ZF874 programs, which caused the Company’s securities to trade at artificially inflated prices. On October 12, 2022, by order, the lawsuit was transferred to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. On February 10, 2023, an amended complaint was filed (“Amended Complaint”) in which our IPO underwriters were added as co-defendants. A number of the claims set forth in the Original Complaint were abandoned including with respect to intentional fraud theory and claims pursuant to Sections 10(b) or 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The only claims alleged in the Amended Complaint were violations of Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act based on alleged misstatements in the S-1 filed by the Company in connection with its Initial Public Offering. The Amended Complaint also abandoned any claims concerning ZF874 and focuses entirely on lixivaptan. The Amended Complaint sought unspecified damages and attorneys’ fees, among other things. On August 23, 2023, the

Company submitted its motion to dismiss all claims. On August 2, 2024, Judge Gregory Wood of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted in full a motion to dismiss with leave for the plaintiff to amend within twenty-one days certain statements and no leave to amend other statements and no ability to expand the scope of the claims pleaded in the Amended Complaint. On August 27, 2024, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissed the plaintiff’s complaint with prejudice and ordered the case closed.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto of Centessa Pharmaceuticals plc, included elsewhere herein.  
Overview
We are a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company with a mission to discover, develop and ultimately deliver medicines that are transformational for patients. We are pioneering a new class of potential therapies within our orexin receptor 2 (OX2R) agonist program for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), impaired attention, cognitive deficits, and fatigue across neurological, neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. Our OX2R agonist pipeline includes ORX750, our most advanced OX2R agonist development candidate, ORX142, ORX489, OX2R agonists in preclinical development, and research efforts on differentiated pharmacology associated with the activation of the orexin system. We also have an early-stage immuno-oncology program focused on our novel LockBody
®
 technology platform. 
We own worldwide rights to all of our pipeline programs and may opportunistically evaluate and enter into strategic partnerships around certain product candidates, targets, geographies, or disease areas. 
We have a track record of making judicious capital and resource allocation decisions for discovery and development efforts across our portfolio, and expeditiously evaluating and terminating programs when the data do not support advancing a program. Consistent with this approach and as part of ongoing portfolio management, in November 2024, we announced the discontinuation of the global clinical development of SerpinPC, a novel inhibitor of activated protein C that was being evaluated for the treatment of hemophilia B. This action was driven by the Company’s decision to prioritize capital toward the development of its OX2R agonist program and the outcome of a planned interim analysis of Part 1 of the PRESent-2 study of SerpinPC. Within the interim analysis, SerpinPC was observed to have a favorable safety and tolerability profile; however, the Company determined that additional time and investment would be required to further develop SerpinPC with a more competitive profile for the treatment of hemophilia B in light of the evolving treatment and market landscape for hemophilia B, including the recent FDA approval of a competing product. More recently, during the first quarter of 2025, we discontinued the clinical development of LB101, a conditionally tetravalent PD-L1xCD47 bispecific monoclonal antibody, and first generation LockBody candidate. This was a strategic decision based on the totality of clinical data to date from the Phase 1/2a first-in-human (FIH) dose escalation study of LB101 in participants with advanced solid tumors. 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $482.2 million. Since inception, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to acquiring and developing product and technology rights, conducting research and development in its discovery and enabling stages, in our clinical and preclinical trials, business operations and raising capital. We have incurred recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and have funded operations primarily through the sale and issuance of our equity securities. The ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of current or future product candidates. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future in connection with ongoing development activities related to the portfolio of programs as we advance the preclinical and clinical development of product candidates; perform research activities as we seek to discover and develop additional programs and product candidates; carry out maintenance, expansion enforcement, defense, and protection of our intellectual property portfolio; and hire additional research and development, clinical and commercial personnel. Further, inflation may affect our use of capital resources by increasing our cost of labor, research, manufacturing and clinical trial expenses. Based on our current operating model and development plans, we expect cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2024 of $482.2 million
, to fund our operations into mid 2027. 

Components of Results of Operations
Revenues
While we received non-recurring revenue related to the out-license of CBS004 and related antibodies in the year ended December 31, 2023, our ability to generate recurring product revenue and to become profitable will depend upon the 
108
Table of Contents

ability to s
uccessfully develop, obtain regulatory approval and commercialize any current and future product candidates. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and regulatory approval, we are unable to predict the amount or timing of product revenue.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred in connection with the discovery and development of the Company’s clinical and preclinical programs, net of reimbursements. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. These expenses include:
•
expenses incurred to conduct the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials required to obtain regulatory approval;
•
milestone payments pursuant to the license agreements;
•
personnel expenses, including salaries, benefits and share-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development functions;
•
costs of funding research and development performed by third parties, including pursuant to agreements with contract research organizations ("CROs") for active and discontinued programs, as well as investigative sites and consultants that conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials;
•
expenses incurred under agreements with contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”), including committed costs for discontinued programs, manufacturing scale-up expenses and the cost of acquiring and manufacturing preclinical study and clinical trial materials;
•
fees paid to consultants who assist with research and development activities;
•
expenses related to regulatory activities, including filing fees paid to regulatory agencies; and
•
allocated expenses for facility costs, including rent, utilities, depreciation and maintenance.
Research and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development will generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. 
We expect research and development expenses to increase significantly over the next several years due to increases in personnel costs, including share-based compensation, increases in costs to conduct clinical trials for current product candidates and other clinical trials for future product candidates and costs to prepare regulatory filings for any product candidates.
The successful development of our current or future product ca
ndidates is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of current or future product candidates, or when, if ever, material net cash inflows may commence from product candidates. This uncertainty is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the duration and cost of clinical trials, which vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of many factors, including:
•
delays in regulators or institutional review boards authorizing us or its investigators to commence our clinical trials, or in our ability to negotiate agreements with clinical trial sites or CROs;
•
the ability to secure adequate supply of product candidates for trials;
•
the number of clinical sites included in the trials;
•
the ability and the length of time required to enroll suitable patients;
•
the number of patients that ultimately participate and remain in the trials;
•
the number of doses patients receive;
•
any side effects associated with product candidates;
•
the duration of patient follow-up;
•
the results of clinical trials;
•
significant and changing government regulations; and
•
launching commercial sales of product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others.
109
Table of Contents

Our expenditures are subject to additional uncertainties, including the terms and timing of regulatory approvals. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for our product candidates. 
We may obtain unexpected results from clinical trials and may elect to discontinue, delay or modify clinical trials of product candidates. A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the European Medicines Agency ("EMA"), FDA or other comparable regulatory authorities were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that are currently anticipated, or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development. Product commercialization will take several years, and we expect to spend a significant amount in development costs.
Research and Development Tax Incentives
We participate in research tax incentive programs that are granted to companies by the United Kingdom in order to encourage them to conduct technical and scientific research. Expenditures that meet the required criteria are eligible to receive a tax benefit. Estimates of the amount of the benefit expected to be received are determined at each reporting period and recorded as reductions to research and development expenses. Through December 31, 2024, we claimed relief under the Small and Medium Enterprise (“SME”) scheme. Beginning January 1, 2025, changes to the program in the UK have aligned the tax incentives earned for SME and large entities. The merged scheme provides relief for qualifying R&D expenditure. If we are loss making, a cash credit can be obtained. If we continue to meet the SME thresholds and are loss making, then a higher rate of credit may be available under the new Enhanced R&D Intensive Support (ERIS). We expect eligible R&D expenditures qualifying for the credit outside of the UK will be more limited as a result of these legislative changes and we expect to recognize less tax incentives in the United Kingdom.
General and Administrative Expense
General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel expenses, including salaries and benefits for employees 
and share-based compensation.
 General and administrative expense also includes facility costs, including rent, utilities, depreciation and maintenance, not otherwise included in research and development expense, as well as legal fees related to intellectual property and corporate matters and fees for accounting, consulting and other professional services.
Interest Income and Interest Expense
Interest income is primarily interest earned from the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments (U.S. Treasury Bills). Interest expense consists of interest costs related to our debt instruments. 
Other Non-Operating Expenses, net
Other non-operating expenses, net consisted s primarily of foreign currency transaction gains

and losses as well as the change in fair value of debt.
Foreign Currency Translation
Our financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars ("USD"), the reporting currency of the Company. The functional currency of Centessa Pharmaceuticals plc is USD and the functional currency of the Centessa Subsidiaries is their respective local currency. Income and expenses have been translated into USD at average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Assets and liabilities have been translated at the rates of exchange on the balance sheets dates and equity accounts at their respective historical rates. The resulting translation gain and loss adjustments are recorded directly as a separate component of shareholders’ equity as other comprehensive income (loss). Transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are remeasured based upon the exchange rate at the date of remeasurement with the resulting gain or loss included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss within Other income (expense), net.

Research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were $150.2 million and $124.4 million, respectively. 
The increase in research and development expenses in 2024 compared with 2023 reflected higher costs of $38.7 million related to the SerpinPC program, due to incremental spending on its registration studies compared with 2023 as well as termination costs related to the discontinuation of the program in November 2024. Research and development costs for our OX2R agonist program increased 
$25.9 million in 2024, primarily related to the initiation of the ORX750 Phase 1 clinical trial in early 2024. Higher costs related to these programs were partially offset by $22.4 million in lower spending on our 
LB101 program and LockBody technology platform as well as lower spending on other discontinued programs. Personnel expenses in 2024 increased
 $3.5 million 
driven by higher share-based compensation of $1.6 million, a higher average number of employees in 2024 versus 2023 as well as increased employee severance costs related to the SerpinPC program. 
On November 12, 2024, we announced the discontinuation of the global clinical development program for SerpinPC, a novel inhibitor of activated protein C (APC) that was being progressed for the treatment of hemophilia B. The strategic decision was made to prioritize capital towards the development of our growing OX2R agonist franchise based on the strength of the interim Phase 1 data for ORX750, coupled with the outcome of a planned interim analysis of Part 1 of the PRESent-2 study of SerpinPC, which was evaluated in the context of the evolving treatment and market landscape for hemophilia B, including the recent FDA approval of a competing product. 
As a result of the discontinuation of the program, we incurred a one-time charge of $31.5 million, consisting of contract termination costs of $30.3 million and employee severance related costs of $1.2 million, which was recorded within Research and development expenses. The contract termination costs related to firm commitments for the manufacture of registrational materials and other costs. The contract termination and employee severance costs associated with this program discontinuation were predominantly accrued as of December 31, 2024 and are expected to be paid in the first half of 2025.

General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were $50.8 million and $53.7 million, respectively. The decline in general and administrative expense primarily reflected a favorable comparison as 2023 
included enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system implementation costs, as well as higher legal and professional fees.
 Personnel expenses increased $3.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily driven by hi
gher share-based compensation expense of $2.5 million.
Interest Income and Interest Expense
For the year ended December 31, 2024, interest income was $14.0 million, which increased $3.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2023, and reflected interest earned from a higher average cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balances in 2024 relative to 2023 due to higher cash proceeds from equity offerings. At the end of March 2023, w
e began investing excess cash in U.S. Treasury Bills and SEC-registered money market funds in addition to cash deposits. 
Interest expense was $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $0.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2023, as a result of a higher average interest rate on debt.

Loss on Extinguishment of Debt
On October 1, 2021, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the “NPA”) with Oberland Capital Management LLC (the “Purchasers”). On October 4, 2021, a secured note in the principal amount of

$75 million was  funded. In addition to the repayment of the principal as well as quarterly interest payments
, the Company was obligated to pay a Milestone payment equal to 
30%
 of the aggregate principal amount issued under the Notes by the Company upon regulatory approval of any drug candidate. Under the NPA, we were
 obligated to redeem all, but not less than all, of the outstanding notes (if any) and pay all other outstanding obligations. On the applicable repayment date, the Company was required to repurchase the notes by paying an amount of up to (i) 185% of the principal amount issued under the notes if such repurchase occurs between the third and sixth anniversaries of the First Purchase Date, and (ii) 205% of the principal amount issued under the notes if such repurchase occurs thereafter, in each case less specified deductions and exclusions described in the NPA, including amounts paid by the Company to the Purchasers in respect of certain asset sale or strategic transactions, the interest payments and the Milestone Payments (the “Final Payment Amount”).
As of December 31, 2024, all of outstanding obligations under the NPA were extinguished. The Company used the proceeds from a new debt issuance to pay off remaining obligations of the NPA. The Company recognized a loss on the extinguishment of this debt of $34.1 million.
Other Non-Operating Expenses, net
Other non-operating expenses, net for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $1.7 million, primarily reflecting  foreign currency transaction losses of $1.8 million. 
Other non-operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $5.4 million, primarily reflecting a $5.9 million unrealized loss related to remeasuring the Note Purchase Agreement at fair value as of December 31, 2023, partially offset by a foreign currency transaction gain of $0.8 million. 
Income Tax Expense (Benefit)
The Company recorded income tax expense of $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared with an income tax benefit of $25.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The income tax expense in 2024 was primarily the result of the Company’s generation of taxable income in the U.S. The income tax benefit in 2023 was primarily the result of the release of a valuation allowance as a result of an internal reorganization of its subsidiaries that occurred in the second quarter of 2023, as well as a change in estimate related to the finalization of a tax return filing. 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources of Liquidity
As of December 31, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $482.2 million, of which $383.2 million was classified as cash and cash equivalents and $99.0 million was classified as short-term investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Securities with original maturities of three months or less when purchased are included in cash and cash equivalents. 
We
 consider investments with original maturities greater than three months and remaining maturities less than one year to be short-term investments. 
On December 30, 2024, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement (the “Loan and Security Agreement”) with Oxford Finance LLC (“Oxford”), as collateral agent and a lender, and the other lenders from time to time party thereto (collectively, the “Lenders”), pursuant to which the Lenders have entered an agreement to lend the Company an aggregate principal amount of up to $200.0 million in a series of term loans (the “Term Loans”).
Pursuant to the Loan and Security Agreement, the Company received $110.0 million (the “Initial Term Loan”) and incurred $1.1 million of debt issuance costs inclusive of facility and legal fees. The Company has access to up to an additional $40.0 million of loan proceeds in an additional tranche which is available during the period commencing on the date of the occurrence of the Clinical Milestone (as defined in the Loan and Security Agreement) through the earlier of: (i) 90 days following the Clinical Milestone and (ii) June 30, 2028. An additional $50.0 million may be made available to the Company at the Lenders’ sole discretion.
The term loans are set to mature on December 1, 2029 and, following an interest-only period, will begin to amortize in equal monthly installments beginning on February 1, 2029. However, if the Extension Event as defined in the 
113
Table of Contents

Agreement occurs, then at the Company’s option, the term loans could begin to amortize in equal monthly installments beginning on February 1, 2030, and the maturity date will be extended to December 1, 2030.
Substantially all of the proceeds from the Initial Term Loan were used to repay in full the approximately $110 million aggregate principal amount outstanding interest and fees related to the Company’s existing note purchase agreement (the “NPA”) with Three Peaks Capital Solutions Aggregator Fund and Cocoon SA LLC, an affiliate of Oberland Capital Management LLC (collectively, “Oberland Capital”).
On September 11, 2024, the Company filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR (“Shelf”) registering an unspecified amount of the Company’s ordinary shares, American Depository Shares representing ordinary shares, debt securities, warrants, and/or units or any combination thereof with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Shelf automatically became effective upon filing. Under the Shelf, Centessa may offer securities from time to time in one or more offerings, at prices and on terms to be determined by market conditions at the time of offering. The specifics of any future offerings, along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered, will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement, or other offering materials, at the time of any offering. The Company’s prior shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which was declared effective by the SEC on July 12, 2022, covered the offering, issuance and sale of an amount up to $350 million in the aggregate of the Company’s ordinary shares, American Depository Shares representing ordinary shares, debt securities, warrants, and/or units or any combination thereof.
The Company entered into a Sales Agreement, dated January 27, 2023, by and between Centessa Pharmaceuticals plc and Leerink Partners LLC (formerly SVB Securities LLC). As sales agent, Leerink Partners LLC will provide for the issuance and sale by the Company of up to $125 million of its ordinary shares represented by American Depository Shares (“ADSs”) from time to time in “at-the-market” offerings (“ATM Program”). In the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company sold 1,250,000 ordinary shares under the ATM Program, resulting in net proceeds of $9.7 million. On a life to date basis, as of December 31, 2024, the Company has sold 4,290,816
 ordinary shares under the ATM Program, resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately 
$30.5 million
.
In 2024, the Company completed two separate share offerings of its ordinary shares 
through the sale and issuance of a cumulative 29,932,626 ADSs. Each ADS represents one ordinary share with a nominal value of £0.002 per ordinary share. 
The completed offerings, which included the Underwriters’ over-allotment option to purchase additional shares, was made pursuant to the Shelf registration. The net proceeds of these offerings, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, was approximately 
$349.9 million
. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offerings, together with its existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, to fund the continued development of its product candidates, as well as for general corporate purposes.
We have no other ongoing material financing commitments, such as lines of credit or guarantees, that are expected to affect liquidity over the next five years.

In addition in 2024 there was a net increase in net operating liabilities of $22.1 million, primarily reflecting accrued termination-related costs of the SerpinPC program that were not paid in 2024.
During the year ended December 31, 2023, we used $160.3 million of cash in operating activities. Cash used in operating activities reflected a net loss of $151.1 million, adjusted for noncash items as well as an unfavorable change in operating assets and liabilities of $18.9 million. A non-cash net benefit due to the release of a tax valuation allowance included in the net loss was more than offset by non-cash net charges of $36.1 million for share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization expense and the change in the fair value of debt.
Investing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash provided by investing activities was $31.3 million, primarily related to a net redemption of short-term marketable securities in favor of increased cash equivalents from 2023
.
 During the year ended December 31, 2023, net cash used in investing activities was $127.0 million primarily related to the investment of excess cash in short-term marketable securities, namely 
U.S. Treasury Bills.
Financing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was $364.8 million, primarily reflecting $349.9 million in net proceeds related to our issuance of ordinary shares under share offerings, $9.7 million in proceeds from our ATM program as well proceeds from stock option exercises. Proceeds from the Loan and Security Agreement with Oxford were used to pay off our NPA with Oberland. During the year ended December 31, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was $21.1 million, largely reflecting proceeds from our ATM program. 
Funding Requirements
We expect aggregate expenses to increase in connection with ongoing activities, particularly as we continue the research and development of, continue or initiate clinical trials of, and seek marketing approval for any current and future product candidates. In addition we will begin to incur pre-commercial preparatory activities and, if marketing approval is obtained for any product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. In addition, inflation may affect our use of capital resources by increasing our cost of labor, research and clinical trial expenses. Accordingly, there will be a need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with the continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate research and development programs or future commercialization efforts. 
We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially as we:
•
seek to discover and develop current and future clinical and preclinical product candidates;

•
scale up clinical and regulatory capabilities;
•
adapt regulatory compliance efforts to incorporate requirements applicable to marketed products;
•
establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure and scale up external manufacturing capabilities to commercialize any product candidates for which regulatory approval may be obtained;
•
maintain, expand and protect the intellectual property portfolio;
•
hire additional internal or external clinical, manufacturing and scientific personnel or consultants;
•
add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support product development efforts; and
•
incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses in operating as a public company.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of product candidates, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of its working capital requirements. Future funding requirements will depend on and could increase significantly as a result of many factors, including:
•
the scope, progress, results and costs of preclinical studies and clinical trials;
•
the scope, prioritization and number of research and development programs;
•
the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of product candidates;
•
the ability to establish and maintain collaborations on favorable terms, if at all;
•
the extent to which obligations to reimburse exist, or entitled to reimbursement of, clinical trial costs under collaboration agreements, if any;
•
the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims;
•
the costs of securing manufacturing arrangements for commercial production; and
•
the costs of establishing or contracting for sales and marketing capabilities if regulatory approvals are obtained to market product candidates.
Identifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials is a time- consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes many years to complete, and may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of product candidates that we do not expect to be commercially available for the next couple of years, if at all. Accordingly, the need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives will exist. Adequate additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all.
Critical Accounting Policies 
Management’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based on the consolidated financial statements of the Company which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires estimates and judgments be made that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, an evaluation of estimates and judgments are required, including those related to accrued
 research and development expenses and tax-related matters. Esti
mates are based on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While the significant accounting policies are described in more detail in 
Note 2 
to the Company’s consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies are the most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements.

Research and Development Accruals
Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred in connection with the development of product candidates. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
Expenses for preclinical studies and clinical trial activities performed by third parties are accrued based upon estimates of the proportion of work completed over the term of the individual trial and patient enrollment rates in accordance with agreements with CROs and clinical trial sites. Estimates are determined by reviewing external service providers as to the progress or stage of completion of trials or services and the agreed-upon fee to be paid for such services. However, actual costs and timing of clinical trials are highly uncertain, subject to risks and may change depending upon a number of factors, including the clinical development plan.
Estimates of accrued expenses are made as of each balance sheet date in the financial statements based on facts and circumstances known at that time. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, an adjustment to the accrual will be made accordingly. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services, including fees for process development or manufacturing and distribution of clinical supplies that will be used in future research and development activities, are recognized as expense in the period that the related goods are consumed or services are performed.
Milestone payments within the Company’s licensing arrangements are recognized when achievement of the milestone is deemed probable to occur. To the extent products are commercialized and future economic benefit has been established, commercial milestones that become probable are capitalized and amortized over the estimated remaining useful life of the intellectual property. In addition, royalty expenses would be accrued and sublicense non-royalty payments, as applicable, for the amount it is obligated to pay, with adjustments as sales are made.
Tax-related Matters
We regularly assess our ability to realize our deferred tax assets. Assessing the realization of deferred tax assets requires significant judgment. In determining whether our deferred tax assets are more likely than not realizable, we evaluate all available positive and negative evidence, and weighed the evidence based on its objectivity. After consideration of the evidence, including our history of cumulative net losses in the U.K., we concluded that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefits of our U.K. deferred tax assets and accordingly we have provided a valuation allowance for the full amount of the net deferred tax assets in the U.K. After consideration of the evidence, including changes resulting from an internal reorganization of subsidiaries in the second quarter of 2023 and cumulative and expected income of an operating entity that carries out services for other entities in the group and recognizes most of the interest income from cash, cash equivalents and short term investments, we concluded that it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of our United States deferred tax assets, and accordingly, in the second quarter of 2023, we released a previously recorded valuation allowance on our United States deferred tax assets. We continue to assess our ability to realize our United States deferred tax assets each reporting period based on all available positive and negative evidence.
Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments 
As of December 31, 2024, other than what has been disclosed in Note 5 - 
"Debt"
, Note 6 – 
"Commitment and contingencies"
,  and Note 7 - 
"Program Termination costs"
, we had no material contractual obligations and other commitments associated with contracts that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the actions under the contracts.  
We have entered into collaborative arrangements to develop and commercialize intellectual property. These arrangements typically involve two (or more) parties who are active participants in the collaboration and are exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the activities. These collaborations usually involve various activities by one or more parties, including research and development, marketing and selling and distribution. Often, these collaborations require upfront, milestone and royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Amounts due to collaborative partners related to development activities are generally reflected as research and development expenses.  See
