Since we commenced operations, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to discovering, acquiring and developing product candidates, building our TV platform, assembling our core capabilities in understanding key neurodegenerative and lysosomal storage disease pathways, operationalizing clinical trials, building manufacturing capabilities and establishing commercial capabilities. 
Key operational and financing milestones for the year ended December 31, 2024 and in 2025 to date include:
•
Tividenofusp alfa DNL310 (ETV:IDS)
◦
In February 2024, we presented new positive data from the ongoing Phase 1/2 study of tividenofusp alfa in MPS II at the 20th Annual WORLD
Symposium
TM
 demonstrating sustained normalization of heparan sulfate in cerebrospinal fluid ("CSF HS"), robust and sustained reductions in biomarkers of lysosomal dysfunction and neuronal damage (neurofilament light; "NfL"), and improvements and stabilization of multiple clinical outcomes measures over two years of treatment. Also in February, we participated in the Reagan-Udall Foundation for the FDA workshop on CSF heparan sulfate as a potential surrogate biomarker to support accelerated approval in MPS. 
◦
In April 2024, we completed enrollment of 47 participants with MPS II in the Phase 1/2 open-label study. Following the Reagan-Udall Foundation workshop, we received written communication from the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research ("CDER") division of the FDA indicating openness to discussing an accelerated approval pathway for tividenofusp alfa in MPS II with CSF heparan sulfate as a 
surrogate
 biomarker;
◦
In September 2024, we announced that we plan to file a biologics license application ("BLA") for accelerated approval for tividenofusp alpha (DNL310) for the treatment of MPS II, based on the outcome of a recent successful meeting with the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research ("CDER") division of the FDA. In addition, the meeting also provides a path for conversion to full approval based on the totality of the tividenofusp clinical development plan. Based on discussions with CDER, we will include preclinical and clinical data on biomarkers (CSF HS and NfL) and safety in the BLA for tividenofusp alfa as a treatment of MPS II and intend to submit the BLA under the accelerated approval pathway in early 2025. We are preparing for the U.S. launch of tividenofusp alfa for the treatment of MPS II in late 2025 or early 2026;
◦
In January 2025, we announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for tividenofusp alfa (DNL310) for the treatment of individuals with MPS II; and 
118
Table of Contents
◦
In February 2025, we announced that in our global Phase 2/3 COMPASS study of tividenofusp alfa in participants with MPS II, target enrollment of the planned 33 participants with neuronopathic MPS II in Cohort A has been completed; we increased the sample size of Cohort A by nine participants, bringing the total to 42 participants. Cohort B continues to enroll participants with non-neuronopathic MPS II.
•
DNL126 (ETV:SGSH)
◦
In February 2024, we announced that dosing had been initiated in the Phase 1/2 study of DNL126 in MPS IIIA. Further, in February 2024, we presented supportive preclinical data at WORLD
Symposium
TM
 demonstrating that DNL126 improves lysosomal and microglial morphology, degeneration, and cognitive behavior in MPS IIIA mice; and 
◦
In June 2024, DNL126 was selected for the FDA's Support for clinical Trials Advancing Rare disease Therapeutics ("START") program to accelerate the development of rare disease therapeutics. In November 2024, we announced that 
preliminary data from up to 25 weeks of dosing in the ongoing open-label Phase 1/2 study in MPS IIIA participants demonstrated a significant reduction in CSF HS levels from baseline, including normalization. The safety profile supports continued development. The most frequent treatment emergent adverse events were infusion related reactions of mild and moderate severity in all participants. There was one serious adverse event considered by the investigator not related to drug. Based on the preliminary Phase 1/2 results 
and a positive regulatory environment,
 we recently expanded the study and continue to assess the development plans including an accelerated approval path.
•
TAK-594/DNL593 (PTV:PGRN)
◦
In January 2024, we announced that Part B in the TAK-594/DNL593 Phase 1/2 study in participants with FTD-GRN had been voluntarily paused to implement protocol modifications. In the second quarter of 2024, we
 finalized the protocol amendment and dosing in the Phase 1/2 study is ongoing.
•
BIIB122/DNL151 (LRRK2)
◦
In February 2024, we announced that we executed a Collaboration and Development Funding Agreement in January 2024 with a third party related to a global Phase 2a study of BIIB122/DNL151, which we plan to solely operationalize, to evaluate safety and biomarkers associated with BIIB122 (DNL151) in participants with LRRK2-associated Parkinson’s disease (LRRK2-PD). This agreement includes committed funding of $75.0 million, of which $12.5 million was received in January 2024 and $12.5 million was received in July 2024, with the remainder to be triggered based on operational milestones in the study. The third party will be eligible to receive low single-digit royalties from Denali on annual worldwide net sales of LRRK2 inhibitors for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, with royalty amounts varying based on the scope of the label. 
Denali has initiated screening of participants for the global Phase 2a study to evaluate safety and biomarkers associated with BIIB122/DNL151 in participants with LRRK2-PD. 
Biogen will continue to conduct the ongoing global Phase 2b LUMA study in early-stage Parkinson’s disease; enrollment is expected to be completed in 2025. Denali and Biogen will co-commercialize BIIB122/DNL151 assuming regulatory approval; and

◦
In January 2024, we announced our intention to divest our preclinical small molecule portfolio, which was completed effective March 1, 2024. We maintain ownership of, and continue to advance, our current portfolio of clinical stage small molecule programs, in collaboration with our partners. The decision was made based on clinical validation and prioritization of our TV-enabled platforms for brain delivery of large molecules;
◦
In February 2024, we announced that the Phase 2 HIMALAYA study evaluating SAR443820/DNL788 in participants with ALS did not meet the primary endpoint of change in ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised ("ALSFRS-R");
◦
In February 2024, we announced that we entered into a securities purchase agreement 
with certain existing accredited investors
 for the private placement of 3,244,689 shares of our common stock at a price of $17.07 per share and pre-funded warrants to purchase an aggregate of 26,046,065 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $17.06 per pre-funded warrant, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $499.3 million. The pre-funded warrants have an exercise price of $0.01 per share of Common Stock, and are immediately exercisable and will remain exercisable until exercised in full. The private placement closed on February 29, 2024;
◦
In July 2024, Biogen terminated its license to the ATV:Abeta program enabled by our TfR-targeting technology against amyloid beta for the potential treatment of Alzheimer's disease and granted us rights to data generated during the collaboration. As a result of the termination, all rights to develop, manufacture, perform medical affairs activities, and commercialize new TfR-targeting ATV:Abeta therapeutics reverted to us. Biogen licensed our TfR-targeting ATV:Abeta program in April 2023 having exercised an option that was part of the 2020 collaboration agreement between the two companies. Biogen’s decision was not related to any efficacy or safety concerns with the TV platform;
◦
In October 2024, we were informed by Sanofi that the K2 Phase 2 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of SAR443820/DNL788 on serum neurofilament light chain levels in participants with multiple sclerosis was discontinued based on not meeting the primary and key secondary endpoints, and on February 24, 2025, we and Sanofi executed a side letter terminating Sanofi's license to the CNS Products program including SAR443820/DNL788; and
◦
In February 2025, after mutual agreement to discontinue preclinical activities on ATV:TREM2, Takeda delivered notice of its election to terminate the ATV:TREM2 program on February 26, 2025, as per the terms of the Takeda Collaboration Agreement. The ATV:TREM2 program termination will become effective 60 days following the notice date.

We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any product revenue since our inception. We have funded our operations primarily from the issuance and sale of convertible preferred stock, the sale of common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of our common stock in public offerings and private placements, and payments received from our collaboration and funding agreements with Takeda, Sanofi, Biogen and other third parties. 
We have incurred significant operating losses to date and expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. Our ability to generate product revenue will depend on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. We had net losses of $422.8 million, $145.2 million, and $326.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.54 billion. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses as we advance our current clinical stage programs through healthy volunteer and patient trials; broaden and improve our TV platform; acquire, discover, validate and develop additional product candidates; obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property portfolio; and hire additional personnel. 
We have relied on third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture and supply our preclinical and clinical materials to be used during the development of our product candidates through 2024. We 
are in the final stages of building out our 
Salt Lake City ("SLC") manufacturing facility
, and beginning in early 2025 
plan to commence manufacturing operations. Going forward, we plan to use both our SLC facility and third-party contract manufacturers to supply our preclinical and clinical materials. If 
tividenofusp alfa is approved for the treatment of Hunter syndrome, we expect to use third-party contract manufacturers to supply commercial product
.
License and Collaboration Agreements
Collaborations and partnering are central components of our strategy to build, develop and commercialize our portfolio of product candidates. We have numerous arrangements with biopharmaceutical companies, technology companies, academic institutions, foundations, and patient-focused data companies.
Biogen
In October 2020, we entered into the LRRK2 Agreement with Biogen pursuant to which we granted Biogen a license to co-develop and co-commercialize our small molecule LRRK2 Program, in addition to the ROFN and Option Agreement pursuant to which we granted an option and a right of first negotiation to certain of our programs utilizing our TV technology platform; collectively the "Biogen Collaboration Agreement." In connection with our collaboration with Biogen, we also entered into a common stock purchase agreement pursuant to which we sold 
13,310,243 shares of our common stock to BIMA
 for an aggregate purchase price of 
$465.0 million
. Under the terms of the Biogen Collaboration Agreement, we received 
$560.0 million
 in upfront payments in October 2020. 
121
Table of Contents
In April 2023, Biogen exercised its option to license our ATV:Abeta program and we received additional consideration of $5.0 million for an option exercise fee. In August 2023, we executed an Amendment (the “Biogen Amendment”) to the LRRK2 Agreement and ROFN and Option Agreement with Biogen. Pursuant to the Biogen Amendment, the schedule of potential LRRK2 Agreement milestones was amended, while maintaining the same total value of milestones that Denali is eligible to receive. In addition, Biogen waived its option right to the second option program and waived its rights of first negotiation for two other TV-enabled programs under the ROFN and Option Agreement. I
n July 2024, Denali and Biogen executed a Side Letter to the ROFN and Option Agreement, pursuant to which, effective as of the date of the Side Letter,
 Biogen 
terminated its license to the ATV:Abeta program enabled by Denali’s TfR-targeting technology against amyloid beta for the potential treatment of Alzheimer's disease, and granted Denali rights to data generated during the collaboration. The side letter also effected the immediate termination of the ROFN and Option Agreement; as such, the Company expects to receive no future milestone or royalty payments from Biogen related to the ATV:Abeta program.

There were no changes to the terms of the LRRK2 Agreement in the year ended December 31, 2024. 
Further details regarding the terms of the agreements between us and Biogen are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in the section titled "Business - Licenses and Collaborations."
We did not recognize any collaboration revenue under the Biogen Collaboration Agreement in the year ended December 31, 2024, and we recognized related party collaboration revenue of $295.5 million, and $3.1 million in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Further, we recognized research and development expense of $16.7 million, $17.7 million and $8.2 million related to cost sharing payments we made to Biogen in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We have recorded cost sharing payables of $2.5 million and $3.2 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Through December 31, 2024, we have earned $5.0 million in option fee payments but have not recorded any milestone revenue or product sales under the Biogen Collaboration Agreement. 
Sanofi
In October 2018, we entered into the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement with Sanofi pursuant to which certain small molecule CNS and peripheral RIPK1 inhibitors contributed by Sanofi and by us are being, or will be developed and commercialized. On February 24, 2025, we and Sanofi executed a side letter terminating Sanofi's license to the CNS Products program including SAR443820/DNL788, though Sanofi continues to develop eclitasertib (SAR443122/DNL758). 
Further details regarding the terms of the agreement between us and Sanofi, and historic payments between the parties under the agreement, are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in the section titled "Business - Licenses and Collaborations."
We recognized no collaboration revenue associated with the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement in the year ended December 31, 2024, and we recognized collaboration revenue of $25.0 million and $53.4 million in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. No receivable from Sanofi was recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Through December 31, 2024, we had received milestone payments of $100.0 million and we have not recorded any product sales under the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement. 
Subsequent to the February 24, 2025 side letter, 
we expect to receive no future milestone or royalty payments from Sanofi related to the CNS Products program.
Takeda 
In January 2018, we entered into the Takeda Collaboration Agreement pursuant to which we granted Takeda an option to develop and commercialize, jointly with us, our ATV:TREM2, PTV:PGRN and ATV:BACE1/Tau programs, the latter of which was later replaced with our ATV:Tau program. Pursuant to the terms of the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, we also entered into the Purchase Agreement with Takeda in January 2018, pursuant to which we sold 4,214,559 shares of our common stock to Takeda for an aggregate purchase price of $110.0 million. 
122
Table of Contents
In November 2021 and December 2021, Takeda exercised its options for the PTV:PGRN and ATV:TREM2 programs, respectively, subsequent to which we have shared equally in the development costs for the programs. In February 2025, after mutual agreement to discontinue preclinical activities on ATV:TREM2, Takeda delivered notice of its election to terminate the ATV:TREM2 program on February 26, 2025, as per the terms of the Takeda Collaboration Agreement. The ATV:TREM2 program termination will become effective 60 days following the notice date. 
Further details regarding the terms of the agreement between us and Takeda, and historic payments between the parties under the agreements, are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in the section titled "Business - Licenses and Collaborations."
We did not recognize collaboration revenue under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement in the year ended December 31, 2024, and we recognized collaboration revenue of $10.0 million and $51.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Further, we offset research and development expense due to cost sharing reimbursements received from Takeda of $5.9 million, $12.2 million and $18.2 million in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. We recorded receivables of $1.5 million and $2.7 million from Takeda as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Through December 31, 2024, we have received $65.0 million in milestone payments and $10.0 million of option exercise fees from Takeda, and we have not recorded any product sales under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement.
F-star
In August 2016, we entered into the F-star Collaboration Agreement with the 
F-star entities. 
The goal of the collaboration was the development of Fcabs to enhance delivery of therapeutics across the BBB into the brain. In connection with the entry into the F-star Collaboration Agreement, we also purchased an option to acquire all of the outstanding shares of F-star Gamma pursuant to a pre-negotiated buy-out option agreement. 
In May 2018, we exercised such buy-out option and entered into the F-star Purchase Agreement with the shareholders of F-star Gamma and Shareholder Representative Services LLC, pursuant to which we acquired all of the outstanding shares of F-star Gamma. As a result of the Acquisition, F-star Gamma became our wholly-owned subsidiary and the entity's name was changed to Denali BBB Holding Limited. In addition, we became a direct licensee of certain intellectual property of F-star Ltd by way of our assumption of F-star Gamma’s license agreement with F-star Ltd, dated August 24, 2016. 
Further details regarding the terms of the arrangements between us and the F-star entities, and historic payments between the parties under the agreements, are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in the section titled "Business - Licenses and Collaborations."
Through December 31, 2024 we have recognized consideration paid under the F-star Purchase Agreement of $49.8 million as research and development expenses consisting of upfront, preclinical and clinical contingent consideration payments, including a $30.0 million contingent consideration payment triggered in March 2023 upon the achievement of a specified clinical milestone in the ETV:IDS program. We did not recognize contingent consideration in the years ended 
December 31, 2024
 or 2022.
Genentech
In June 2016, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Genentech. The agreement gives us access to Genentech’s LRRK2 inhibitor program. Our collaboration partner in the LRRK2 program, Biogen, is responsible for 
50%
 of any payment obligation to Genentech under the Biogen Collaboration Agreement. 
We have made a total of $25.0 million in consideration payments under the Genentech agreement, including 
$12.5 million 
in the year ended December 31, 2022 related to two clinical milestones. We have recognized $18.8 million of research and development expense, net of cost sharing reimbursements from Biogen, including

$6.3 million in the year ended 
December 31, 2022. We did not recognize expenses under this

Components of Operating Results
Collaboration Revenue
To date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales for the foreseeable future. All revenue recognized to date has been collaboration and license revenue from our collaboration agreements with Takeda, Sanofi and Biogen.
Future revenue may be recognized from the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, Sanofi Collaboration Agreement, and Biogen Collaboration Agreement, and may be generated from product sales or milestone payments, royalties and profit sharing reimbursement from other collaboration agreements, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. We expect that our revenue will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year as a result of the timing and amount of license fees, option exercise fees, milestone payments, profit sharing reimbursement, other payments and product sales, to the extent any are successfully commercialized. If we fail to complete the development of our product candidates in a timely manner or obtain regulatory approval for them, our ability to generate future revenue, and our results of operations and financial position, would be materially adversely affected.
Operating Expenses
Research and Development
Research and development activities account for a significant portion of our operating expenses. We record research and development expenses as incurred. Research and development expenses incurred by us for the discovery and development of our product candidates and TV platform include:
•
 external research and development expenses, including:
–
expenses incurred under arrangements with third parties, such as contract research organizations ("CROs"), preclinical testing organizations, contract development and manufacturing organizations ("CDMOs"), academic and non-profit institutions and consultants;
–
expenses to acquire technologies to be used in research and development that have not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use;
–
fees related to our license and collaboration agreements;
•
personnel related expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense; and
•
other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for laboratory, facilities and other costs.
A portion of our research and development expenses are direct external expenses, which we track on a program-specific basis once a program has commenced late-stage IND-enabling studies.

124
Table of Contents
Program expenses include expenses associated with our most advanced product candidates and the discovery and development of backup or next-generation molecules. We also track external expenses associated with our TV platform. These expenses include external expenses incurred by us relating to our Takeda Collaboration Agreement, Biogen Collaboration Agreement and Sanofi Collaboration Agreement. All external costs associated with earlier stage programs, or that benefit the entire portfolio, are tracked as a group. We also incur personnel and other operating expenses for our research and development programs which are presented in aggregate. These expenses primarily relate to salaries and benefits, stock-based compensation, facility expenses including rent and depreciation, and lab consumables. Where we share costs with our collaboration partners, such as in our Biogen Collaboration Agreement and Takeda Collaboration Agreement, research and development expenses may include cost sharing reimbursements from, or payments to, our collaboration partners. Further, where we receive R&D funding from third parties, this may be recognized as a reduction to research and development expenses.
It is challenging to predict the nature, timing and estimated long-range costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of, and obtain regulatory approval for, any of our product candidates. This is made more challenging by events outside of our control, such as global pandemics and increased geopolitical uncertainty. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from sales or licensing of our product candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with drug development, including the uncertainty of:

•
our ability to add and retain key research and development and commercial, sales and marketing personnel;
•
our ability to establish an appropriate safety profile with IND-enabling toxicology studies;
•
our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and then successfully commercialize, our product candidates;
•
our successful enrollment in and completion of clinical trials;
•
the costs associated with the development of any additional product candidates we identify in-house or acquire through collaborations;
•
our ability to discover, develop and utilize biomarkers to demonstrate target engagement, pathway engagement and the impact on disease progression of our molecules;
•
our ability to establish agreements with third-party manufacturers for clinical supply for our clinical trials and commercial manufacturing, if our product candidates are approved;
•
the terms and timing of any collaboration, license or other arrangement, including the terms and timing of any milestone payments thereunder;
•
our ability to obtain and maintain patent, trade secret and other intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates if and when approved;
•
our receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;
•
our ability to commercialize products, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; and
•
the continued acceptable safety profiles of the product candidates following approval.
125
Table of Contents
A change in any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates would significantly change the costs, timing and viability associated with the development of that product candidate. We expect our research and development expenses to increase at least over the next several years as we continue to implement our business strategy, advance our current programs, expand our research and development efforts, seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, access and develop additional product candidates and incur expenses associated with hiring additional personnel to support our research and development efforts. In addition, product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally incur higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses include personnel related expenses, such as salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense, expenses for outside professional services, pre-commercial preparatory activities, and allocated expenses. Outside professional services consist of legal, accounting and audit services and other consulting fees. Allocated expenses consist of rent, depreciation and other expenses related to our office and research and development facility not otherwise included in research and development expenses. We expect to increase our administrative headcount as we prepare for commercialization of Tividenofusp alfa (DNL310, ETV:IDS) and advance our other product candidates through clinical development, which will increase our general and administrative expenses.
Gain from divestiture of small molecule programs
The gain from the divestiture of small molecule programs consists entirely of the non-cash gain associated with the divestiture of 
assets associated with select preclinical small molecule programs, including specified intellectual property, tangible assets and equipment used to conduct early-stage small molecule drug discovery from the Company, in exchange for equity consideration.
Interest and Other Income, Net 
Interest and other income, net, consists primarily of interest income and investment income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, as well as sublease income, and an offset from interest expense on our finance lease liability.

Collaboration revenue. 
There was no collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024 and $330.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in collaboration revenue of $330.5 million was primarily due to $293.9 million in revenue recognized in April 2023 under the Biogen Collaboration Agreement as a result of Biogen exercising its option to license our ATV:Abeta program, as well as decreases due to revenue earned under the Takeda and Sanofi Collaboration Agreements of $10.0 million and $25.0 million, respectively.
Research and development expenses. 
Research and development expenses were $396.4 million

for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $423.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Personnel-related expenses include stock-based compensation expense of $59.1 million and $62.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, reflecting a decrease of $3.8 million.
127
Table of Contents
The decrease in research and development expenses of approximately $27.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily attributable to decreases of $7.5 million in personnel-related expenses, including decreases in salary and stock-based compensation expenses, decreases in other research and development expenses of $11.8 million, as well as $7.2 million in small molecule programs external expense, primarily driven by the divestiture of our preclinical small molecule programs in March 2024 and focus on the Company's TV-enabled portfolio.
General and administrative expenses
. General and administrative expenses were $105.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $103.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily driven by activities related to the planned submission of a BLA for tividenofusp alfa in early 2025 and preparations for a commercial launch in late 2025 or early 2026.
Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources of Liquidity
As of December 31, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalent
s and marketable securities in the amount 
of $1.19 billion
. We fund our operations primarily with the proceeds from the sale of common stock and payments received from our collaboration partners, including those received under agreements with Takeda, Sanofi, and Biogen. We have sold common stock and other securities in public offerings, a private placement, and stock purchase agreements with Takeda and Biogen. 
Through 
December 31, 2024 
we have obtained aggregate net proceeds of approximately 
$754.4 million
 from public offerings of our common stock, including 
$296.2 million obtained through the sale of 11.9 million shares of common stock in October 2022. 
Under stock purchase agreements with collaboration partners we have received a further 
$575.0 million through December 31, 2024
.
Further, in February 2024 we received net proceeds of approximately 
$499.3 million
 from our private placement through the sale of approximately 
3.2 million
 shares of common stock and

pre-funded warrants 
to purchase a
pproximately 
26.0 million shares of our common stock
. 
I
n February 2025, we established a registered “at-the-market” facility for the future sale of up to $400.0 million of shares of common stock from time to time by entering into an equity distribution agreement with Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and Leerink Partners LLC as sales agents. The previous equity distribution agreement and related “at-the-market” facility entered into in February 2022 was terminated in February 2025. To date, no shares have been sold under either equity distribution agreement. All sales under the current equity distribution agreement are conditioned upon satisfaction of customary closing conditions.
Pursuant to our collaboration and research and development funding agreements with Takeda, Sanofi and Biogen and an unrelated third party, through December 31, 2024 we have received upfront, option and milestone payments of 
$115.0 million
, 
$225.0 million
, 
$565.0 million and $25.0 million
, respectively, and have also received 
$48.6 million
 and 
$16.2 million 
of gross cost sharing reimbursements from Takeda and Biogen, respectively, and received 
$13.7 million
 in specified reimbursements from Sanofi.

Future Funding Requirements and Commitments
To date, we have not generated any product revenue. We do not expect to generate any product revenue unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize any of our product candidates, and we do not know when, or if, either will occur.
We expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect the losses to increase as we expand our research and development activities and continue the development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates, and begin to commercialize any approved products. Further, we expect general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to incur additional costs associated with supporting our growing operations. We are subject to all of the risks typically related to the development of new product candidates, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. We anticipate that we will need substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations.
Until we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue from the commercialization of our product candidates or from our existing collaboration agreements, or future agreements with other third parties, if ever, we expect to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity or debt financings. Additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of additional debt or equity securities, it could result in dilution to our existing stockholders, increased fixed payment obligations and the existence of securities with rights that may be senior to those of our common stock. If we incur indebtedness, we could become subject to covenants that would restrict our operations and potentially impair our competitiveness, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Additionally, any future collaborations we enter into with third parties may provide capital in the near term but limit our potential cash flow and revenue in the future. Any of the foregoing could significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects.
Since our inception, we have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations. We have an accumulated deficit of $1.54 billion as of December 31, 2024. We expect to incur substantial additional losses in the future as we conduct and expand our research and development activities. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to enable us to fund our projected operations through at least the twelve months following the filing date of this Form 10-K, including our existing commitments as outlined below. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. In the longer term, we anticipate that we will need substantial additional resources to fund our operations and meet future commitments. 
Our existing commitments primarily relate to our obligations under existing lease agreements, and certain clinical and manufacturing agreements, including the DMSA 
with Lonza Sales AG ("Lonza") for the development and manufacture of biologic products. A
s of December 31, 2024, the operating lease liability was 
$45.0 million
 and the finance lease liability was 
$9.3 million. Under the DMSA with Lonza, and certain other clinical and manufacturing agreements, we had total non-refundable purchase commitments of $63.0 million as of 
December 31, 2024, with 
certain amounts subject to cost sharing with Takeda. While the lease obligations span multiple years, the majority of the purchase commitments with Lonza and other clinical and manufacturing agreements are due within twelve months, with some spanning several years. Further, we may be required to make contingent payments under existing arrangements upon the achievement of defined clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones in certain programs, including contingent consideration payments to former shareholders of F-star under the F-star Gamma license, and milestone and royalty payments to Genentech under the Genentech License Agreement. These commitments are more fully described in Note 4, "Acquisition, License Agreement and Research and Development Funding Collaboration Agreement" and Note 7, "Commitments and Contingencies" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K
.
129
Table of Contents
Our future funding requirements, including changes to and new commitments, will depend on many factors, including:
•
the timing and progress of preclinical and clinical development activities;
•
the number and scope of preclinical and clinical programs we decide to pursue;
•
the progress of the development efforts of third parties with whom we have entered into license and collaboration agreements;
•
our ability to maintain our current research and development programs and to establish new research and development, license or collaboration arrangements;
•
our ability and success in securing manufacturing relationships with third parties or in establishing and operating a manufacturing facility;
•
the costs involved in prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property claims;
•
the cost and timing of regulatory approvals;
•
our efforts to enhance operational, financial and information management systems and hire additional personnel, including personnel to support development of our product candidates; and
•
the costs and ongoing investments to in-license and/or acquire additional technologies.
A change in the outcome of any of these or other variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. Furthermore, our operating plans may change in the future, and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements associated with such operating plans.

Critical Accounting Estimates
This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenues recognized and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our significant accounting policies are described in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. We believe that the following accounting estimates involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty which could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue associated with our collaboration arrangements, which 
may require us to exercise considerable judgment in estimating revenue to be recognized, including judgments made on day one accounting and judgments associated with the amount of revenue to be recognized over time as performance obligations are satisfied. 
131
Table of Contents
Significant judgment is required to apply the authoritative accounting guidance at the outset of a collaboration arrangement, and over time, and the determinations including judgment are highly subjective and can differ between arrangement based on specific contractual terms. To date, there have been no material true ups to revenue as a result of changes in the key judgments detailed below.
The key areas of judgment identified are: (1) Identification of performance obligations at the outset of a collaboration arrangement (identifying the promised goods or services and determining whether these are distinct in the context of the contract); (2) Measurement of the transaction price at the outset of a collaboration arrangement and at each reporting period (estimating valuation of share premium payments, constraint of future variable consideration); (3) Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations at the outset of a collaboration arrangement (
estimating the standalone selling price of identified performance obligations); and (4) 
Recognition of revenue when (or as) we satisfy each performance obligation, assessed at each reporting period (when the performance obligation has been satisfied for point-in time recognition, the extent of satisfaction of an obligation for recognition over time).
Research and Development Expenses
A significant portion of our research and development expenses in the 
Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss
 are external costs. These research and development expenses include the conduct of preclinical studies and clinical trials, contract manufacturing activities and consulting services. The measurement of these research and development expenses can impact the measurement of research and development expenses in the 
Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss
, and of prepaid assets and accrued liabilities on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets
. 
The level of judgment required to estimate research and development expenses varies based on the nature of the services being performed and the underlying support obtained. We estimate the amount of work completed based on information received from internal personnel and external service providers as to the progress or stage of completion of the services and the agreed-upon fee to be paid for such services. As actual costs become known, we adjust our accrued estimates. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, incomplete or inaccurate data from vendors could impact our understanding of the status and timing of services performed which could result in us reporting expenses that are too high or too low in any particular period. 
In some cases, expense is recorded using an underlying assumption of the progress to completion of specific activities. For example, costs may be recognized based on the passage of time for activities that span reporting periods. If the provision of services is not linear then this assumption could impact the amount of expense recognized. For other activities, such as for certain clinical trials, expense is recorded based on information obtained from vendors as an intermediary to those performing the underlying services, such as contract research organizations. These estimates are inherently more judgmental since the quality and availability of the underlying data may vary. 
To date, there have been no material true ups from estimated to actual external research and development expenses. However, w
e expect that the level of judgment in estimating research and development expenses may increase over time as we are entering later stage, more extensive, clinical trials. 
132
Table of Contents
Research and development expenses also include reimbursements owed or owing to a collaboration partner to satisfy cost sharing requirements. These reimbursement amounts are estimated based, in part, on data received from our collaboration partner, which may include a certain level of estimation or judgments made by that partner. They also reflect our estimates of research and development expense as discussed above. As such, a change in estimates or judgments by either our partner or us can result in a change to a reimbursement amount. 
To date, there have been no material true ups from estimated to actual reimbursements owed or owing. 
Where the company has entered into an 
R&D funding arrangement, payments received will be recorded as a liability, and recognized an offset to research and development expenses as the underlying research and development costs are incurred. 
The determination of whether an arrangement meets the definition of an R&D funding arrangement under ASC730 requires judgment, including an assessment of the nature of the arrangement, the funding party’s rights and exposure to research and development risks. Further, the timing of recognition of the funding is also subject to the judgments of the underlying 
research and development costs. To date, there have been no material true ups to R&D funding recognition.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our business.
ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business, primarily related to interest rate and foreign currency sensitivities.
Interest Rate Sensitivity
We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. We had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1.19 billion as of December 31, 2024, which consisted primarily of money market funds and marketable securities, largely composed of investment grade, short and intermediate term fixed income securities.
The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital to fund our operations. We also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk. To achieve our objectives, we maintain a portfolio of investments in a variety of securities of high credit quality and short-term duration, according to our board-approved investment policy. Our investments are subject to interest rate risk and could fall in value if market interest rates increase. A hypothetical 10% relative change in interest rates during any of the periods presented would not have had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Foreign Currency Sensitivity
The majority of our transactions occur in U.S. dollars. However, we do have certain transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro and British Pound, and we therefore are subject to foreign exchange risk. The fluctuation in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies affects the reported amounts of expenses, assets and liabilities primarily associated with a limited number of preclinical, clinical and manufacturing activities.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Denali Therapeutics Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Denali Therapeutics Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss
,
 stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 27, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated

financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures

to which it relates.
135
Accrued and prepaid research and development costs
Description of the Matter
As more fully described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records accrued liabilities for estimated costs of research and development (R&D) activities and prepaid research and development costs based upon the estimated cost of services provided and the timing associated with those payments. As of December 31, 2024, accrued clinical and other R&D costs were $18.1 million and prepaid clinical R&D costs were $6.5 million. The accrued and prepaid R&D costs (“Accrued and Prepaid R&D Costs”) are based on an estimate of the clinical trial and related R&D costs incurred under service agreements with organizations that conduct R&D activities on behalf of the Company. The Company expenses costs incurred based on several factors, such as information obtained from vendors and estimates of the work completed by the vendors. 
Auditing the Company's accounting for Accrued and Prepaid R&D Costs was complex because the Company’s analyses are dependent upon data obtained from external third-party service providers who directly perform services but also often act as intermediaries to those performing the underlying services. The determination of the balances when the Company has either not been invoiced or has not received information regarding actual costs incurred requires estimation of the stage of completion of certain services.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the Company’s process for accounting for Accrued and Prepaid R&D Costs, including management’s controls over completeness and accuracy of data used in determining these costs as well as management’s process for estimating work completed under the service agreements. 
To test the Accrued and Prepaid R&D Costs, our audit procedures included, among others, i) confirming the completeness of the terms and conditions of significant R&D service agreements directly with the vendors; ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying inputs used in the Company’s analyses through verification of significant inputs, such as costs incurred and invoices paid, to the terms and conditions of the underlying agreements and information from the Company’s internal personnel and vendors; iii) testing significant assumptions used in estimating costs of services provided including meeting with personnel outside of the accounting department to discuss the basis for such assumptions; and iv) performing a hindsight analysis of invoices received subsequent to the balance sheet date.

Denali Therapeutics Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
1.    
Significant Accounting Policies
Organization and Description of Business
Denali Therapeutics Inc. ("Denali" or the “Company”) is a biopharmaceutical company, incorporated in Delaware, that discovers and develops therapeutics to defeat neurodegenerative diseases and lysosomal storage diseases. The Company is headquartered in South San Francisco, California.
Basis of Presentation
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

Principles of Consolidation
These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. For the Company and its subsidiaries, the functional currency has been determined to be U.S. dollars. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are remeasured at period-end exchange rates, non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured at historical rates, and transactions in foreign currencies are remeasured at average exchange rates. Foreign currency gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are recognized in interest and other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences could be material to the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.
Concentration of Credit Risk and Other Risks and Uncertainties
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Substantially all of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents are deposited in accounts with financial institutions that management believes are of high credit quality. Such deposits have and will continue to exceed federally insured limits. The Company maintains its cash with accredited financial institutions and accordingly, such funds are subject to minimal credit risk. 
The Company’s investment policy limits investments to certain types of securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, as well as institutions with investment-grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer. The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of a default by the financial institutions holding its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and issuers of marketable securities to the extent recorded on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets
. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had 
no
 off-balance sheet concentrations of credit risk.
141
Table of Contents
The Company is subject to a number of risks similar to other clinical-stage biopharmaceutical companies, including, but not limited to, the need to obtain adequate additional funding, possible failure of current or future preclinical testing or clinical trials, its reliance on third parties to conduct its clinical trials, the need to obtain regulatory and marketing approvals for its product candidates, competitors developing new technological innovations, the need to successfully commercialize and gain market acceptance of the Company’s product candidates, its right to develop and commercialize its product candidates pursuant to the terms and conditions of the licenses granted to the Company, protection of proprietary technology, the ability to make milestone, royalty or other payments due under any license or collaboration agreements, and the need to secure and maintain adequate manufacturing arrangements with third parties. If the Company does not successfully commercialize or partner any of its product candidates, it will be unable to generate product revenue or achieve profitability. 
Further, the company is also subject to broad market risks and uncertainties resulting from recent events, such as bank failures or instability in the financial services sector, global pandemics, war and armed conflicts, inflation, rising interest rates, and recession risks as well as supply chain and labor shortages.
Convertible Preferred Stock
The Company is authorized to issue 
40.0
 million shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the powers, designations, preferences and relative participating option or other rights thereof, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, redemption terms, liquidation preferences and the number of shares constituting any series, without any further vote or action by the Company’s shareholders. As of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023
, the Company had 
no
 shares of preferred stock issued or outstanding.
Investments
The Company holds an equity investment in a venture-backed privately held company, Tenvie Therapeutics, Inc. ("Tenvie"). The privately held company is a Variable Interest Entity ("VIE"), but the Company is not the primary beneficiary. The Company does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the investee. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss from this VIE is limited to the value of the equity investment. The equity investment held by the Company lacks a readily determinable fair value and therefore the securities are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar equity securities of the same issuer. The Company reviews the carrying value of its equity investment for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such asset may not be fully recoverable. Impairments, if any, are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the recoverable amount of the asset. There were 
no
 impairments during the year ended December 31, 2024.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”), establishes a fair value hierarchy for instruments measured at fair value that distinguishes between assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and the Company’s own assumptions (unobservable inputs). Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.
ASC 820 identifies fair value as the exchange price, or exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, ASC 820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between the following:
142
Table of Contents
Level 1
 – inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2
 – inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3
 – inputs are unobservable inputs that reflect the Company’s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
To the extent that the valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3.
The carrying amounts reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for cash and cash equivalents, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase to be cash and cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are reported at fair value. 
Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows is composed of cash and cash equivalents reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $
1.6
 million of restricted cash for the letter of credit for the Company’s headquarters building lease which is included within other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Marketable Securities
The Company generally invests its excess cash in money market funds and investment grade short to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Such investments are included in cash and cash equivalents, or short-term marketable securities or long-term marketable securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, are considered available-for-sale, and are reported at fair value with net unrealized gains and losses included as a component of stockholders’ equity. 
The Company classifies investments in securities with remaining maturities of less than one year, or where its intent is to use the investments to fund current operations or to make them available for current operations, as short-term investments. The Company classifies investments in securities with remaining maturities of over one year as long-term investments, unless intended to fund current operations. The amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, which is included in interest and other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. Realized gains and losses and declines in value determined to be due to credit losses on marketable securities, if any, are included in interest and other income, net.
143
Table of Contents
The Company periodically evaluates the need for an allowance for credit losses. This evaluation includes consideration of several qualitative and quantitative factors, including whether it has plans to sell the security, whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell any marketable securities before recovery of its amortized cost basis, and if the entity has the ability and intent to hold the security to maturity, and the portion of any unrealized loss that is the result of a credit loss. Factors considered in making these evaluations include quoted market prices, recent financial results and operating trends, implied values from any recent transactions or offers of investee securities, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, expected cash flows from securities, other publicly available information that may affect the value of the marketable security, duration and severity of the decline in value, and the Company's strategy and intentions for holding the marketable security.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable are included within prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The accounts receivable balance represents amounts receivable from the Company's collaboration partners net of an allowance for credit losses, if required.

Property and Equipment, Net
Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. 
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the related estimated useful lives as presented in the table below. Significant additions and improvements are capitalized, while repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred.
Asset
Estimated useful life
Leasehold improvements
shorter of life of asset or lease term
Computer equipment and purchased software
three years
Laboratory equipment
five years
Furniture and fixtures
five years
Manufacturing equipment
eight years
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company periodically evaluates property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may have occurred. If such events or changes in circumstances arise, the Company compares the carrying amount of the long-lived assets to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the long-lived assets. If the estimated aggregate undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the long-lived assets, an impairment charge, calculated as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets, is recorded. The fair value of the long-lived assets is determined based on the estimated discounted cash flows expected to be generated from the long-lived assets. The Company has not recorded any material impairment charges during the years presented.
Leases
The Company leases real estate and certain equipment for use in its operations. A determination is made as to whether an arrangement is a lease at inception. The Company recognizes finance and operating lease right-of-use ("ROU") assets, and finance and operating lease liabilities based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments at the commencement date. The Company adjusts ROU assets as needed for any lease incentives it receives and for assets it purchases that are regarded as landlord-owned. When determining the present value of lease payments, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate on the date of lease commencement, or the rate implicit in the lease, if known. The Company does not assume renewals in its determination of the lease term unless the renewals are deemed by management to be reasonably certain at lease inception.
144
Table of Contents
The Company recognizes amortization of the ROU assets and interest on the lease liabilities for its finance lease. Finance lease ROU assets are amortized on a straight-line basis from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the ROU asset or the end of the lease term. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Leases with an initial term of twelve months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet, unless they include an option to purchase the underlying asset that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise. The Company has leases with lease and non-lease components, which the Company has elected to account for as a single lease component.
Revenue Recognition
License, Option and Collaboration Revenue
The Company analyzes its collaboration arrangements to assess whether they are within the scope of ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements (“ASC 808”) to determine whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activities. For elements of collaboration arrangements that are accounted for pursuant to ASC 808, an appropriate recognition method is determined and applied consistently, generally by analogy to Topic 606. The accounting treatment pursuant to Topic 606 is outlined below.
Each of these Payments received under license, option and collaboration agreements result in license, collaboration and other revenue, except for revenues from royalties on net sales of licensed products, which are classified as royalty revenue. 
The Company may also receive reimbursement or make payments to a collaboration partner to satisfy cost sharing requirements. These payments are accounted for pursuant to ASC 808 and are recorded as an offset or increase to research and development expenses, respectively. 
The Company recognizes revenue as it fulfills its obligations under each of its agreements. An asset is transferred when, or as, the customer obtains control of that asset, which for a service is considered to be as the services are received and used. The Company recognizes revenue over time by measuring the progress toward complete satisfaction of the relevant performance obligation using an appropriate input or output method based on the nature of the service promised to the customer. Amounts received prior to satisfying the revenue recognition criteria are recorded as current or non-current contract liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets, depending on when the performance obligation is expected to be satisfied.

Research and Development Expenses
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs consist of salaries and other personnel related expenses, including associated stock–based compensation, consulting fees, lab supplies, and facility costs, as well as fees paid to other entities that conduct certain research, development and manufacturing activities on behalf of the Company. 
Where the Company shares costs with collaboration partners, such as in the Biogen Collaboration Agreement and the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, research and development expenses may include cost sharing reimbursements from or payments to the collaboration partner, respectively. Where the company has entered into an 
R&D funding arrangement, payments received will be recorded as a liability, and recognized an offset to research and development expenses as the underlying research and development costs are incurred.
145
Table of Contents
Nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used or received in future research and development activities are deferred and recognized as expense in the period in which the related goods are delivered or services are performed. There can be judgment involved in measuring the research and development expenses to be recognized in a particular period. 
In some cases, expense is recorded using an underlying assumption of the progress to completion of specific activities. For example, costs may be recognized based on the passage of time for activities that span reporting periods. If the provision of services is not linear then this assumption could impact the amount of expense recognized. The level of judgment varies based on the nature of the services being performed and the underlying support obtained. For some activities, such as for certain clinical trials, expense is recorded based on information obtained from vendors as an intermediary to those performing the underlying services, such as contract research organizations. These estimates are inherently more judgmental since the quality and availability of the underlying data may vary. The determination of whether an arrangement meets the definition of an R&D funding arrangement under ASC730 requires judgment, including an assessment of the nature of the arrangement, the funding party’s rights and exposure to research and development risks. Further, the timing of recognition of the funding is also subject to the judgments of the underlying 
research and development costs.
The Company has acquired and may continue to acquire the rights to develop and commercialize new product candidates from third parties. The upfront payments to acquire license, product or rights, as well as any future milestone payments, are immediately recognized as research and development expense provided that there is no alternative future use of the rights in other research and development projects.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company’s stock-based compensation programs grant awards that have included stock options, restricted stock units, restricted stock awards, and shares issued under its employee stock purchase plan. Grants are awarded to employees, directors, and non-employee service providers.
The Company measures compensation expense for all stock-based awards at the grant date based 
on the fair value measurement of the award. 
The expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period, for the entire award. Expense is adjusted for actual forfeitures of unvested awards as they occur. The Company calculates the fair value measurement of stock options subject solely to service-based vesting requirements using the Black-Scholes valuation model. 
The Company uses the fair value of its common stock to determine the fair value of restricted stock awards.

Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for using the liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and consideration is given to net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
The Company assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income, and a valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not expected to be realized.
The calculation of our current provision for income taxes involves the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments while taking into account current tax laws, interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of future tax audits. The Company has established reserves to address potential exposures related to tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. Any changes in tax law or interpretation of tax law and the resolutions of potential tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.

Comprehensive Loss
Comprehensive loss is composed of net loss and certain changes in stockholders’ equity that are excluded from net loss, primarily unrealized gains or losses on the Company’s marketable securities.
Net Loss Per Share
Basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, without consideration for common stock equivalents. Diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share, since the effects of potentially dilutive securities are antidilutive given the net loss for each period presented. The weighted-average common shares outstanding as of December 31, 2024 includes pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of common stock that were issued in connection with the February 2024 private placement, as discussed further in Note 8 - "Common Stock".

Acquisition, License Agreement and Research and Development Funding Collaboration Agreement
Acquisition of F-star Gamma
In May 2018, the Company exercised an option to acquire all of the outstanding shares of F-star Gamma Limited ("F-Star Gamma") pursuant to a prenegotiated buy-out option agreement (the "Acquisition"). As a result of the Acquisition, F-star Gamma became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the Company changed the entity’s name to Denali BBB Holding Limited. In addition, the Company became a direct licensee of certain intellectual property of F-star Biotechnology Limited (“F-Star Ltd”) by way of the Company’s assumption of F-star Gamma’s license agreement with F-star Ltd, dated August 24, 2016, (the “F-star Gamma License”). The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition. 
149
Table of Contents
The Acquisition obligates the Company to make certain contingent payments to former shareholders and under the F-star Gamma license. In 2023, the Company incurred $
30.0
 million in R&D expenses associated with the achievement of a clinical milestone. There was 
no
 contingent consideration expense recognized for the years ended December 31, 2024 or 2022. Under this arrangement, the Company may be required to make additional contingent consideration payments of up to $
210.0
 million, consisting of up to $
60.0
 million in regulatory contingent payments and up to $
150.0
 million in commercial contingent payments.
Genentech License Agreement
In June 2016, the Company entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with Genentech, Inc. (“Genentech”), giving the Company access to Genentech’s LRRK2 inhibitor small molecule program for Parkinson's disease. 
The Company may owe Genentech milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory, and commercial milestones, up to a maximum of $
315.0
 million in the aggregate, including up to $
37.5
 million in clinical milestone payments, $
102.5
 million in regulatory milestone payments and $
175.0
 million in commercial milestone payments. In addition, the Company may owe royalties on net sales of licensed products ranging from low to high single-digit percentages. 
The Company has made a total of $
25.0
 million in consideration payments under the Genentech agreement, including 
$
12.5
 million 
in the year ended 
December 31, 2022
 related to 
two
 clinical milestones. The Company has recognized $
18.8
 million of research and development expense, net of cost sharing reimbursements from Biogen, including

$
6.3
 million in the year ended
 December 31, 2022. The Company did 
not
 recognize expenses under this
 agreement
 in 
the years ended December 31, 2024 and 
2023. 
Collaboration and Development Funding Agreement
On January 29, 2024, the Company entered into a Collaboration and Development Funding Agreement with an unrelated third party, pursuant to which this third party will provide up to $
75.0
 million of funding and collaborate with the Company to conduct a global Phase 2a study of BIIB122/DNL151 in patients with Parkinson’s disease and confirmed pathogenic variants of LRRK2.
Pursuant to this agreement, the Company received payments totaling $
25.0
 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, with the remainder to be paid upon achievement of operational milestones in the study. After the full $
75.0
 million in consideration has been paid, the third party will be eligible to receive low single-digit royalties from the Company on annual worldwide net sales of LRRK2 inhibitors for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. 
The Company determined that this arrangement is an R&D funding arrangement under ASC 730. As the third party is sharing in the risk associated with research and development activities with the Company, the development funding is recognized as an obligation to perform contractual services. Accordingly, payments received will be recorded as a liability, and recognized by the Company as a reduction to research and development expenses over the estimated Phase 2a study period as the underlying research and development costs are incurred. Under this arrangement, the Company recognized a $
10.9
 million offset to research and development expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company recorded a current deferred research and development funding liability of $
14.1
 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2024.

Collaboration Agreements
150
Table of Contents
Biogen
In August 2020, the Company entered into a binding Provisional Collaboration and License Agreement (“Provisional Biogen Collaboration Agreement”) with Biogen Inc.’s subsidiaries, Biogen MA Inc. (“BIMA”) and Biogen International GmbH (“BIG”) (BIMA and BIG, collectively, “Biogen”) pursuant to which the Company granted Biogen a license to co-develop and co-commercialize Denali’s small molecule LRRK2 inhibitor program (the “LRRK2 Program”), an option in respect of each of (i) the Company’s amyloid beta program utilizing the Company's TransportVehicle
TM 
("TV") technology to cross the blood-brain barrier ("BBB") and (ii) 
one
 other unnamed program also utilizing the Company's TV technology platform (the “Option Programs”), and a right of first negotiation with respect to 
two
 additional unnamed programs for indications within Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ("ALS") and multiple sclerosis ("MS") utilizing the Company's TV technology platform (the “ROFN Programs”), should the Company decide to seek a collaboration with a third party for such programs. The Provisional Biogen Collaboration Agreement was a binding agreement, which became effective on the closing of the Common Stock Purchase Agreement ("SPA"), as described further below. The Provisional Biogen Collaboration Agreement expired in October 2020 upon the execution of a Definitive LRRK2 Collaboration and License Agreement (“LRRK2 Agreement”) with Biogen on October 4, 2020 and a Right of First Negotiation, Option and License Agreement (the “ROFN and Option Agreement”) on October 6, 2020 (collectively, the "Biogen Collaboration Agreement"). Biogen made an upfront payment of $
560.0
 million upon execution of the Biogen Collaboration Agreement in October 2020, which was included in the transaction price at inception. 
In August 2023, the Company and Biogen executed an Amendment (the “Biogen Amendment”) to the LRRK2 Agreement and ROFN and Option Agreement, pursuant to which Biogen waived its option to the second option program and its ROFN rights. I
n July 2024, Denali and Biogen executed a Side Letter to the ROFN and Option Agreement, pursuant to which, effective as of the date of the Side Letter,
 Biogen 
terminated its license to the Company's 
amyloid beta program utilizing the Company's TV technology platform
, and granted Denali rights to data generated during the collaboration. The side letter also effected the immediate termination of the ROFN and Option Agreement; as such, the Company expects to receive 
no
 future milestone or royalty payments from Biogen related to the ROFN and Option Agreement.
LRRK2 Agreement
With respect to the LRRK2 Program, 
Biogen 
is required to make milestone payments up to approximately $
1.125
 billion upon achievement of certain development and sales milestone events. Such milestone payments include $
375.0
 million in development, $
375.0
 million upon first commercial sale, and $
375.0
 million in net sales-based milestones. Pursuant to the Biogen Amendment, the schedule of potential LRRK2 Agreement milestones was amended, while maintaining the same total value of milestones that Denali is eligible to receive. The Company will share 
50
% of the profits and losses with Biogen for LRRK2 Products in the United States, and 
40
% of such profits and losses in China. The Company will be entitled to receive royalties in the high teens to low twenties percentages on net sales for LRRK2 Products outside of the United States and China.
The Company and Biogen are jointly developing LRRK2 Products pursuant to a clinical development plan set forth within the LRRK2 Agreement. The parties share responsibility and costs for global development of LRRK2 Products pursuant to a mutually agreed development plan and budget ("LRRK2 Development Activities"), with Biogen funding 
60
% and the Company funding 
40
% of such costs.
151
Table of Contents
The Company may opt out of development cost sharing worldwide and upon such election, from any further profit-sharing from the LRRK2 Program. The Company also has the right to opt-out of the profit sharing arrangement for the LRRK2 Program or for only those LRRK2 Products that do not penetrate the BBB (“Peripheral LRRK2 Products”), in each of the United States and China. After such an opt out, the Company will no longer be obligated to share in the development and commercialization costs for, or be entitled to share in the applicable revenues from, such LRRK2 Program (or from the Peripheral LRRK2 Products) for such country, as applicable. If the Company chooses to exercise its opt out rights, the Company will be entitled to receive tiered royalties on net sales of the applicable LRRK2 Program in the relevant country (or countries). The royalty rates for the applicable LRRK2 Program will be a percentage in the high teens to low twenties, but may increase to the mid-twenties if the Company has met certain co-funding thresholds or there has been a first commercial sale at the time of the Company's election.
Stock Purchase Agreement
In connection with the Provisional Biogen Collaboration Agreement, the Company entered into a common stock purchase agreement (the "Stock Purchase Agreement") with BIMA on August 5, 2020, pursuant to which the Company sold 
13,310,243
 shares of common stock (the “Shares”) to BIMA for an aggregate purchase price of $
465.0
 million. Management determined that it was appropriate to account for the Provisional Biogen Collaboration Agreement and the SPA as one arrangement because they were entered into at the same time with interrelated financial terms. This stock issuance resulted in a $
44.9
 million premium paid to the Company above the estimated fair value of the Company's common stock, which forms part of the transaction price at inception for the Biogen Collaboration Agreement. The shares of common stock owned by Biogen as of December 31, 2022 and through September 30, 2023, represented approximately 
10
% of the voting interest of the Company, and as such, Biogen was considered a related party as defined in ASC 850. In the quarter ended December, 2023, the percentage voting interest had declined such that Biogen was no longer considered a related party as defined in ASC 850.
Biogen Collaboration Agreement
In April 2023, Biogen exercised its option to license the Company's ATV:Abeta program and made a $
5.0
 million option exercise fee payment. 
The Biogen Collaboration Agreement was considered to be a contract modification to the Provisional Biogen Collaboration Agreement and was accounted for as a termination of the provisional agreement and commencement of a new contract. The Biogen Amendment was considered to be a continuation of the Biogen Collaboration Agreement.
The Company identified the following distinct performance obligations associated with the Biogen Collaboration Agreement that had not yet been delivered under the original contract: the LRRK2 Program license, the research services for the ATV:Abeta and TV programs (“Option Research Services”) which include option joint steering committee ("JSC") participation, and a material right for an option under the ROFN and Option Agreement. Further, the LRRK2 Development Activities which includes LRRK2 JSC and joint development committee (“JDC”) participation was identified as a unit of account under ASC 808. The LRRK2 Development Activities, JSC and JDC participation are considered to be a single unit of account since the development activities are highly interrelated with the JSC and JDC involvement and these are not distinct in the context of the contract. Further, the same was considered to be true for the option research services and option JSC participation performance obligation. 
The Company believes that the Biogen Collaboration Agreement is a collaboration arrangement as defined in ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements. The Company also believes that Biogen meets the definition of a customer as defined in ASC 606, Revenue From Contracts With Customers for all of the performance obligations identified at inception except for the LRRK2 Development Activities. Since ASC 808 does not address recognition and measurement, the Company looked to other accounting literature for guidance where the performance obligation does not fall under ASC 606, and determined that for the interim LRRK2 development activities subject to cost sharing provisions, the guidance in ASC 730, Research and Development should be applied.
152
Table of Contents
The Company identified the LRRK2 Program license, the research services for the ATV:Abeta and TV programs (“Option Research Services”) and a material right for an option under the ROFN and Option Agreement as distinct performance obligations associated with the Biogen Collaboration Agreement. Further, the LRRK2 Development Activities was identified as a unit of account under ASC 808. The respective standalone value for each of the performance obligations was determined at inception by applying the SSP method and the transaction price of $
604.9
 million at inception was allocated based on the relative SSP method with revenue recognition timing to be determined either by delivery, resolution of an option, or the provision of services.
The LRRK2 Program license was delivered on or around the effective date of the Biogen Collaboration Agreement and the revenue allocated to this performance obligation was recognized during the year ended 
December 31, 2020
. The Option Research Services were delivered over time as the services are performed, with revenue being recognized over time based on costs incurred to perform the services. As of 
December 31, 2023
, all revenue allocated to the Option Research Services had been recognized. The $
288.9
 million of revenue allocated to the material right for an option under the ROFN and Option Agreement was initially deferred as a contract liability, and was recognized in full during the year ended December 31, 2023, upon Biogen's ATV:Abeta option exercise, along with the $
5.0
 million option exercise fee paid upon opt in, which was fully allocated to the material right. The LRRK2 Development Activities cost sharing reimbursements or expenses are being recognized over time as earned or incurred, since this is believed to directly correlate to the value of the services performed.
In assessing the Biogen Collaboration Agreement, management exercised considerable judgment in estimating revenue to be recognized, specifically related to estimating the discount for lack of marketability associated with the stock issuance, determining the separate performance obligations under the Biogen Collaboration Agreement, and estimating the standalone selling price of those performance obligations.
As of 
December 31, 2024
, the Company had earned $
5.0
 million in option fee payments, but had 
no
t recorded milestone revenue or product sales under the Biogen Collaboration Agreement. 
Sanofi
In October 2018, the Company entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement ("Sanofi Collaboration Agreement") with Genzyme Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sanofi S.A. ("Sanofi") pursuant to which certain small molecule CNS and peripheral receptor interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 1 ("RIPK1") inhibitors contributed by Sanofi and by the Company would be developed and commercialized. When the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement became effective in November 2018, Sanofi paid us $
125.0
 million upfront. Under the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement, Sanofi is required to make milestone payments totaling up to approximately $
495.0
 million upon achievement of certain clinical, regulatory and sales milestone events for the Peripheral Products. Such milestone payments include $
120.0
 million in clinical milestone payments, $
175.0
 million in regulatory milestone payments and $
200.0
 million in commercial milestone payments for Peripheral Products, as defined, that are developed and approved in the United States, Europe and in Japan for three indications. Sanofi has made payments of $
35.0
 million for Peripheral Product clinical milestones through December 31, 2024, and payments of $
65.0
 million for CNS Product clinical milestones through the sale date. On February 24, 2025, Denali and Sanofi executed a side letter terminating Sanofi's license to the CNS Products program including SAR443820/DNL788. Subsequent to this side letter, the Company expects to receive no future milestone or royalty payments from Sanofi related to the CNS Products program. The Company will receive variable royalties on net sales for Peripheral Products sold worldwide, each as further described below. 
Sanofi will be responsible, at its cost, for conducting activities relating to the development and commercialization of all Peripheral Products. Denali will be entitled to receive tiered royalties in the low- to mid- teen percentages on net sales of Peripheral Products.

Table of Contents
The Company believes that the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement is a collaboration arrangement as defined in ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements. The Company also believes that Sanofi meets the definition of a customer as defined in ASC 606, Revenue From Contracts With Customers for all of the performance obligations identified at inception except for the Alzheimer's Disease Services. Since ASC 808 does not address recognition and measurement, the Company looked to other accounting literature for guidance where the performance obligation does not fall under ASC 606, and determined that for any future cost sharing, the guidance in ASC 730, Research and Development should be applied.
The Company identified the
 CNS program license, the Peripheral program license, the Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials for CNS Products for Alzheimer’s disease ("Alzheimer's Disease Services"), and the Phase 1b trial for DNL747 for ALS and associated activities ("Retained Activities") 
as distinct performance obligations associated with the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement. The respective standalone value for each of the performance obligations was determined at inception by applying the SSP method and the transaction price at inception was allocated based on the relative SSP method with revenue recognition timing to be determined either by delivery or the provision of services.
The program licenses and existing know-how were delivered on the effective date of the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement, and as such upfront revenue allocated to these performance obligations were recognized at this time. Further, clinical milestones are recognized as earned since these relate to the underlying program licenses previously delivered. The Alzheimer’s Disease Services and the Retained Activities were expected to be delivered over time as the services are performed. For the Alzheimer's Disease Services, revenue was recognized over time using the input method, based on costs incurred to perform the services, since the level of costs incurred over time was thought to best reflect the transfer of services to Sanofi. For the Retained Activities, revenue was recognized over time using the output method, based on amounts invoiced to Sanofi, since this is believed to directly correlate to the value of the services performed. 
During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company earned clinical milestones of $
25.0
 million and $
50.0
 million, respectively. These milestones were recognized in collaboration revenue from customers in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss during for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, s
ince the associated performance obligation has been satisfied
. There were 
no
 milestones recognized in collaboration revenue from customers in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the year ended 
December 31, 2024
. 
The Company has 
no
 remaining performance obligations under the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement, and 
no

contract liability remains on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024 or 2023
. 
The Company did 
no
t record any receivable associated with the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024 or 2023.
In assessing the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement, management exercised considerable judgment in estimating revenue to be recognized. Management applied judgment in determining the separate performance obligations, in estimating the selling price, in determining when control was transferred to Sanofi for the licenses, and in estimating total future costs when using the input method.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had earned milestone payments of 
$
100.0
 million
 and had

Takeda 
Takeda Collaboration Agreement
In January 2018, the Company entered into a Collaboration and Option Agreement ("Takeda Collaboration Agreement") with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited ("Takeda"), pursuant to which the Company granted Takeda an option to develop and commercialize, jointly with the Company, certain biologic products that are enabled by the Company's BBB delivery technology and intended for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. The programs subject to the Takeda Collaboration Agreement were the Company
’s ATV:BACE1/Tau, 
ATV:TREM2 and PTV:PGRN programs. The Takeda Collaboration Agreement became effective in February 2018, 
at which time Takeda paid the Company an upfront payment of $
40.0
 million. In February 2019, the agreem
ent was amended to replace the ATV:BACE1/Tau program with the ATV:Tau program, and in March 2022, Takeda and the Company agreed to terminate activity on the ATV:Tau program. Subsequent to the ATV:Tau termination, total preclinical milestone payments that Takeda owed under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement was
 $
55.0
 million for all 
three
 programs, all of which had been earned and received as of 
December 31, 2022
.
Pursuant to the terms of the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, the Company entered into a common stock purchase agreement with Takeda on January 3, 2018, pursuant to which Takeda purchased 
4,214,559
 shares of the Company’s common stock on February 23, 2018 for an aggregate purchase price of $
110.0
 million, which included a $
15.6
 million stock premium.
Subsequent to Takeda exercising its option with respect to a particular target and collaboration program (i.e., the biologic products directed to the target for which Takeda has exercised its option), Takeda has the right to develop and commercialize, jointly with the Company, a specified number of biologic products enabled by its BBB delivery technology that were developed during the research period and which are directed to the relevant target, and the Company grants to Takeda a co-exclusive license under the intellectual property the Company controls related to those biologic products.
The Company did 
not
 record any product sales and there are 
no
 remaining performance obligations under the initial Takeda Collaboration Agreement. The Takeda Collaboration Agreement was superseded by the PTV:PGRN and ATV:TREM2 Collaboration Agreements subsequent to opt-in for the 
two
 programs, recognition of all preclinical milestones, and termination of the ATV:Tau program.
PTV:PGRN and ATV:TREM2 Collaboration Agreements
In November and December 2021, Takeda exercised its options to jointly develop and commercialize the PTV:PGRN and ATV:TREM2 programs, respectively, triggering the option fee of 
$
5.0
 million for each program, which formed the transaction price at contract inception for each contract, all of which 
was allocated to the underlying Technology License in each Collaboration Agreement which was delivered on or around the effective date of the respective Collaboration Agreement. Management determined that the opt-in by Takeda on the PTV:PGRN and ATV:TREM2 programs represent 
two
 new contracts with a customer for accounting purposes (the "PTV:PGRN Collaboration Agreement" and the "ATV:TREM2 Collaboration Agreement"), both effective in December 2021 upon payment of the respective option fees. From inception of the PTV:PGRN Collaboration Agreement and the ATV:TREM2 Collaboration Agreement through December 31, 2024, there was no change to the terms of either agreement; In February 2025, after mutual agreement to discontinue preclinical activities on ATV:TREM2, Takeda delivered notice of its election to terminate the ATV:TREM2 program on February 26, 2025, as per the terms of the Takeda Collaboration Agreement. The ATV:TREM2 program termination will become effective 
60
 days following the notice date.
155
Table of Contents
For each contract, upon option exercise, the Company identified a single performance obligation under ASC 606, and initially one unit of account under ASC 808 associated with each of the PTV:PGRN and ATV:TREM2 Collaboration Agreements. The performance obligation was the delivery of a co-exclusive license under the intellectual property the Company controls related to the PTV:PGRN or ATV:TREM2 program ("PTV:PGRN Technology License" or "ATV;TREM2 Technology License"), and the unit of account is the obligation to share in responsibility and costs for global development of PTV:PGRN or ATV:TREM2 Products pursuant to a mutually agreed upon development plan and budget ("PTV:PGRN Development Activities" or "ATV:TREM2 Development Activities"), which both include JSC involvement. The PTV:PGRN Development Activities and JSC participation, and the ATV:TREM2 Development Activities and JSC participation are each considered to be single units of account since the activities are highly interrelated with the JSC involvement and these are not distinct in the context of the contract.
The Company believes that the PTV:PGRN and ATV:TREM2 Collaboration Agreements are both collaboration arrangements as defined in ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements. The Company also believes that Takeda meets the definition of a customer as defined in ASC 606, Revenue From Contracts With Customers for the PTV:PGRN Technology License and the ATV:TREM2 Technology License performance obligations delivered in these collaboration agreements, respectively. Since ASC 808 does not address recognition and measurement, the Company looked to other accounting literature for the PTV:PGRN Development Activities and ATV:TREM2 Development Activities units of account, and determined that the guidance in ASC 730, Research and Development should be applied.
Under the PTV:PGRN Collaboration Agreement, Takeda may be obligated to pay the Company up to $
140.0
 million upon achievement of certain clinical milestone events and up to $
100.0
 million in regulatory milestone events relating to receipt of regulatory approval in the United States, certain European countries and Japan. Takeda may also be obligated to pay the Company up to $
75.0
 million upon achievement of a certain sales-based milestone. Further, the Company and Takeda share equally the development and commercialization costs, and, if applicable, the profits, for the PTV:PGRN program. Subsequent to the effective date of the termination of the ATV:TREM2 Collaboration Agreement, there will be no future milestones, cost, or profit sharing related to this agreement.  
A $
10.0
 million milestone was triggered under the PTV:PGRN Collaboration Agreement upon achievement of a specified clinical milestone and recognized in collaboration revenue from customers in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the year ended 
December 31, 2023. No product sales have been recorded under either agreement. 
In assessing the Takeda Collaboration Agreement and the PTV:PGRN and the ATV:TREM2 Collaboration Agreements, management was required to exercise considerable judgment in estimating revenue to be recognized. Management applied judgment in determining whether opt-in resulted in a modification to an existing contract or a new contract, in determining the separate performance obligations in the research period, and estimating variable consideration.

Lease Obligations
In May 2018, the Company entered into an operating lease for its corporate headquarters in South San Francisco (the "Headquarters Lease"), a 
148,020
 rentable square feet building in South San Francisco, California (the "Headquarters"). The Headquarters Lease has a contractual term of 
10
 years which ends on March 31, 2029, after which the Company has an option to extend the lease term for a further 
ten years
. The Company determined that this renewal was not reasonably certain at lease inception.
 T
he accounting lease commencement date was determined to be August 1, 2018.
The Headquarters Lease provides for monthly base rent amounts escalating over the term of the lease. In addition, the Headquarters Lease provided a tenant improvement allowance ("TIA") of up to $
25.9
 million, which was fully utilized, of which $
4.4
 million will be repaid to the landlord in the form of additional monthly rent. This is recorded as leasehold improvement assets and an offset to the lease ROU asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheets
. The Company is also required to pay the operating expenses for the Headquarters, such as taxes and insurance, which are treated as variable lease payments.
In August 2021, the Company entered into an operating lease for laboratory, office and warehouse facilities in Salt Lake City, Utah. In March 2023, the Company terminated this operating lease, which resulted in the recognition of $
7.9
 million of accelerated depreciation on leasehold improvements during the year ended 
December 31, 2023
. The lease had not commenced for accounting purposes.
In April 2023, the Company entered into a new lease in Salt Lake City (the "SLC Lease") for a 
59,336
 square foot laboratory, office and warehouse premises with a contractual term of approximately 
15
 years, and undiscounted lease payments of approximately $
13.4
 million, which was subsequently amended in October 2023. The Company has the option to extend the lease term for a period of 
ten years
 at the end of the lease term. The accounting lease commencement date was determined to be August 1, 2024, the date the Company was deemed to have obtained control over the property, at which time the lease was determined to be a finance lease and the lease liability and ROU asset were recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Included in the ROU asset as of December 31, 2024 are $
41.6
 million

of assets purchased by the Company, which are considered to be owned by the landlord.
Management exercised judgment in applying the requirements of ASC 842, including the determination as to whether certain contracts contain a lease, lease classification, the lease consideration, and the commencement date of the leases, and for leases identified under the standard, the discount rate used to determine the measurement of the lease liability. The discount rates of the Company's operating and finance leases are an approximation of the Company's incremental borrowing rate and are dependent upon the term and economics of the agreement. To estimate the incremental borrowing rates, management considered observable debt yields of comparable market instruments, as well as benchmarks within the lease agreement that may be indicative of the rate implicit in the lease. There were no changes to the terms of the leases recognized under ASC 842 during the year ended December 31, 2024.
Operating lease costs, including variable lease costs recognized under ASC 842, were $
7.2
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and $
8.0
 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. Variable lease costs were $
5.1
 million, $
4.4
 million and $
4.0
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Finance lease costs representing amortization of ROU assets and interest on lease liability were $
1.2
 million and $
0.3
 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2024. There were 
no
 finance lease costs for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 
2022
.

Indemnification
In the ordinary course of business, the Company may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to vendors, lessors, business partners, board members, officers, and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of breach of such agreements, services to be provided by the Company, negligence or willful misconduct of the Company, violations of law by the Company, or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with directors and certain officers and employees that will require the Company, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors, officers or employees. No demands have been made upon the Company to provide indemnification under such agreements, and thus, there are no claims that the Company is aware of that could have a material effect on the Company’s 
Consolidated Balance Sheets
, Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss, or 
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows

Commitments
Effective September 2017, the Company entered into a Development and Manufacturing Services Agreement as amended (“DMSA”) with Lonza Sales AG (“Lonza”) for the development and manufacture of biologic products. Under the DMSA, the Company will execute purchase orders based on project plans authorizing Lonza to provide development and manufacturing services with respect to certain of the Company's antibody and enzyme products, and will pay for the services provided and batches delivered in accordance with the DMSA and project plan. Unless earlier terminated, the DMSA will expire when all development and manufacturing services are completed, which is not expected to be before November 2029. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had total non-cancellable purchase commitments under the DMSA of $
36.7
 million and $
37.6
 million, respectively.
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 
2022,
 the Company incurred costs of $
34.1
 million, $
39.5
 million, and $
28.6
 million, respectively, and made payments of $
36.6
 million, $
37.1
 million, and $
23.9
 million respectively, for the development and manufacturing services rendered under the DMSA. 
In the normal course of business, the Company enters into other firm purchase commitments primarily related to research and development activities. The Company had contractual obligations under certain clinical and manufacturing agreements other than the DMSA of $
24.1
 million and $
34.8
 million, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with certain amounts subject to cost sharing with Takeda. Further, the Company had other commitments of $
2.2
 million and $
1.6
 million as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
Contingencies
From time to time, the Company may be involved in lawsuits, arbitration, claims, investigations and proceedings consisting of intellectual property, employment and other matters which arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that the Company concludes that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated.

Common Stock
On February 27, 2024, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") with certain investors for the private placement of (i) 
3,244,689
 shares of Denali's common stock at a price of $
17.07
 per share and (ii) pre-funded warrants to purchase an aggregate of 
26,046,065
 shares of Denali's common stock (the "Pre-Funded Warrants") at a purchase price of $
17.06
 per Pre-Funded Warrant, which represents the per share price for the common stock less the $
0.01
 exercise price. The private placement closed on February 29, 2024, at which time the Company received aggregate net proceeds of approximately $
499.3
 million, after deducting issuance costs of approximately $
0.5
 million.
The Pre-Funded Warrants were classified as a component of permanent equity in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as they are freestanding financial instruments that are immediately exercisable, do not embody an obligation for the Company to repurchase its shares and permit the holders to receive a fixed number of shares of common stock upon exercise. All of the Pre-Funded Warrants issued in the private placement were outstanding as of December 31, 2024.

Stock-Based Awards
Equity Incentive Plans
The Company's equity incentive plans, the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2017 Plan”), and previously, the 2015 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2015 Plan”), reserve shares of common stock for the issuance of stock options, restricted stock and other stock awards, to employees, non-employee directors, and consultants under terms and provisions established by the board of directors and approved by the stockholders. Upon adoption of the 2017 Plan, 
no
 new awards or grants are permitted under the 2015 Plan. The 2015 Plan 
continues to govern restricted stock awards and option awards previously granted thereunder.
Awards granted under the 2017 Plan and 2015 Plan expire no later than 
ten years
 from the date of grant. For stock options, the option price shall not be less than 
100
% of the estimated fair value of the Company's common stock on the day of grant. Options granted typically vest over a 
four
-
year
 period but may be granted with different vesting terms. 
The 2017 Plan provides that the number of shares reserved and available for issuance under the 2017 Plan will automatically increase each January 1, beginning on January 1, 2019, by the lesser of (i) 
10.0
 million shares, (ii) 
5
% of the outstanding shares on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year, or (iii) such number of shares determined by the administrator of the 2017 Plan. In 2024, common stock available for issuance under the 2017 Plan was increased by approximately 
6.8
 million shares as a result of this automatic increase provision. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were approxim
ately 
14.3
 million
 and 
12.5
 million common shares available for the Company to grant under the 2017 Plan, respectively.

requires various assumptions, including the fair value of the Company’s common stock, expected term, expected dividend yield, expected volatility, and the risk-free interest rate.

The fair value of the Company’s common stock is based on the current market price, unless an adjustment is determined to be required, through discussion with senior management, due to material non-public information known by the Company at the time of grant. The expected volatility of the Company’s stock options is estimated using a combination of average historical stock price volatility of the Company's stock and that of comparable public companies within the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry that are deemed to be representative of future stock price trends, since the Company does not have sufficient trading history to rely solely on the volatility of its common stock. The Company will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of its own stock price becomes available. Management considers whether the Company is in possession of material non-public information at the time of grants when making certain estimates, including volatility and the fair value of the Company's common stock. The expected term of stock options represents the period that the Company’s stock-options are expected to be outstanding and is determined using the simplified method (based on the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term). The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield currently available on U.S. treasury notes with terms approximately equal to the expected life of the option. The expected dividend rate is 
zero
 as the Company currently has no history or expectation of declaring cash dividends on the Company’s common stock.

Recognition of deferred tax assets
 is appropriate when realization of such assets is more likely than not. Based upon the weight of available evidence, especially the uncertainties surrounding the realization of deferred tax assets through future taxable income, the Company believes it is not more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be fully realizable. Accordingly, the Company has provided a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. There was an increase in the net valuation allowance of $
111.9
 million during the year ended December 31, 2024.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company has federal net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards of approximately 
$
436.6
 million
, which are available to reduce future taxable income, and has federal R&D and orphan drug tax credits of approximately 
$
64.2
 million
 and 
$
56.9
 million
 respectively, both of which may be used to offset future tax liabilities. The federal NOL and federal tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2034. The Company also has state NOL carryforwards of approximately 
$
310.9
 million
, which are available to reduce future taxable income, and has state tax credits of approximately 
$
44.4
 million
 which may be used to offset future tax liabilities. The state NOL will begin to expire in 2031 and the state tax credit carryforwards will be carried forward 
indefinitely. 
The NOL and tax credit carryforwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and state tax authorities and may become subject to an annual limitation in the event of certain future cumulative changes in the ownership interest of significant stockholders over a three-year period in excess of 50%, as defined under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. This could limit the amount of tax attributes that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities. 
Annual limitations may result in expiration of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before some or all of such amounts have been utilized.
The Company follows the provisions of ASC 740
, Accounting for Income Taxes
, and the accounting guidance related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. The Company determines its uncertain tax positions based on a determination of whether and how much of a tax benefit taken by the Company in its tax filings is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant income tax authorities.

no
 liability has been recorded for potential interest or penalties. The Company does 
no
t expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next 12 months.
Since the Company is in a loss carryforward position, the Company is generally subject to examination by the U.S. federal, state and local income tax authorities for all tax years in which a loss carryforward is available.

Divestiture of Preclinical Small Molecule Programs
On March 1, 2024, the Company divested certain assets, including specified intellectual property, tangible assets, and equipment used to conduct early stage small molecule drug discovery ("Divested Assets") through an Asset Purchase and License Agreement (the "Asset Purchase Agreement") executed with Tenvie. Additionally, certain of the Company’s employees terminated their employment with the Company and became employees of Tenvie. 
In exchange for the Divested Assets, the Company received equity consideration of $
15.0
 million in the form of a simple agreement for future equity (“SAFE”). In December 2024, the SAFE converted into 
15.0
 million shares of Tenvie's Series A Preferred Stock, par value $
0.0001
 per share, with a fair value of $
15.0
 million. Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company is eligible to receive certain market valuation, development and sales based milestone payments up to approximately $
1.2
 billion in the form of either cash or equity at the election of Tenvie. The Company will also be entitled to receive future royalties on aggregate net sales of certain products, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis during the periods of time commencing at the time of the first commercial sale of such product in such country, until the later of (i) the expiration of certain related patents, (ii) the expiration of Regulatory Exclusivity, or (iii) 
ten years
 after such first commercial sale.
In March 2024, Tenvie and the Company also entered into a sublease for approximately 
12,000
 square feet of office and lab space within the Company's corporate headquarters, and transition and research services agreement ("Service Agreements"). The sublease commenced in May 2024 and continues through September 2025, with 
one
 optional 
six month
 extension period. The Service Agreements provides access to the Company's equipment and the provision of certain specified administrative and research services to Tenvie for a period concurrent with the sublease term. 
This divestiture did not meet the criteria for reporting discontinued operations as the sale does not represent a strategic shift in the Company’s business. The Company recognized a gain on divestiture of approximately $
14.5
 million in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss during the year ended 
December 31, 2024
, representing the difference between the fair value of the consideration received and the carrying amount of the Divested Assets.
The Company recorded the investment in the shares of Series A Preferred Stock at $
15.0
 million which represents the fair value of the shares on the date of issuance. There have been no subsequent observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar equity securities of Tenvie, and as such, the measurement of this investment remains unchanged
, with the 
$
15.0
 million 
included within
 other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of 
December 31, 2024
.
14.    
Segment Information
The Company has 
one
 operating segment with the goal to discover, develop and commercialize therapeutics (“Therapeutics”). The Company has not generated any revenue from product sales, and has no marketing or commercial product distribution costs. All revenue to date has been collaboration and license revenue from the Company’s collaboration agreements.
The Company’s chief operating decision maker ("CODM"), its Chief Executive Officer, manages the Company’s operations on a consolidated basis for the purposes of allocating resources.
The CODM, in alignment with the Company's overall corporate strategy and goals, analyses a variety of data to guide segment resource allocation, including program and portfolio scientific data, product market information and projections, probability of regulatory and commercial success, and the competitive environment. The CODM also reviews certain financial results included in the segment Loss from Operations which is reported on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss as total Loss from Operations. The measure of segment assets is reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets

as Total Assets. The accounting policies of the Therapeutics segment are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies.

ITEM 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Conclusions Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of December 31, 2024, management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objective and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Under the supervision of and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in “Internal Control—Integrated Framework” (2013). Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Denali Therapeutics Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Denali Therapeutics Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Denali Therapeutics Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss
,
 stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated February 27, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 granted Takeda options with respect to the ATV:BACE1/Tau, ATV:TREM2 and PTV:PGRN programs in exchange for an upfront payment of $40.0 million and an additional $110.0 million
 under a February 2018 share purchase agreement. 
The Takeda Collaboration Agreement became effective in February 2018, following satisfaction of certain requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976.

The ATV:Tau program was substituted for the ATV:BACE1/Tau program via amendment of the Takeda Collaboration Agreement in February 2019, and in March 2022, the parties mutually agreed to terminate activity on the ATV:Tau program. Takeda exercised its option for the PTV:PGRN program in November 2021 and the parties have continuing obligations with r
espect to this program under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement. 
We are
 eligible to receive payments under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement for PTV:PGRN upon the achievement of certain clinical and sales-based milestones or upon achievement of certain regulatory milestones relating to regulatory approval in the United States, certain European countries, and Japan. 
Further, we and Takeda share equally the development and commercialization costs, and, if applicable, will share the profits, for the PTV:PGRN program.
Takeda exercised its option for the ATV:TREM2 program in December 2021. On February 26, 2025, after mutual agreement to discontinue preclinical activities on ATV:TREM2, we received notice of Takeda's election to terminate the ATV:TREM2 program effective sixty days following the date of the notice from Takeda, or earlier if mutually agreed by the parties. Takeda's notice terminated provisions of the Collaboration Agreement relating to the ATV:TREM2 program, including those related to future milestones, cost or profit sharing.
