Item 7A.
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
Market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. The primary market risks that we are exposed to are interest rate, prepayment, spread, liquidity, extension and credit risks.
Interest Rate Risk
We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with the fixed income nature of our assets and the short-term, variable rate nature of our financing obligations. Our operating results depend in large part on differences between the income earned on our assets and our cost of borrowing and hedging activities. The costs associated with our borrowings are generally based on prevailing market interest rates. During a period of rising interest rates, our borrowing costs generally will increase while the yields earned on our existing portfolio of leveraged fixed-rate assets will largely remain static. This can result in a decline in our net interest spread. Changes in the level of interest rates can also affect the rate of mortgage prepayments and the value of our assets. 
Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including fiscal and monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political considerations, as well as other factors beyond our control. Subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT, we engage in a variety of interest rate management techniques to mitigate the influence of interest rate changes on our net interest income and fluctuations of our tangible net book value. The principal instruments that we use to hedge our interest rate risk are interest rate swaps, swaptions, U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. Treasury futures contracts. Our hedging techniques are highly complex and are partly based on assumed levels of prepayments of our assets. If prepayments are slower or faster than assumed, the maturity of our investments will also differ from our expectations, which could reduce the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and may cause losses on such transactions and adversely affect our cash flow. 
The severity of potential declines in our tangible net book value due to fluctuations in interest rates would depend on our asset, liability, and hedge composition at the time, as well as the magnitude and duration of the interest rate change. Primary measures of an instrument's price sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations are its duration and convexity. Duration measures the estimated percentage change in market value of an instrument that would be caused by a parallel change in short and long-term interest rates. The duration of our assets will vary with changes in interest rates and tends to increase when interest rates rise 
43
and decrease when interest rates fall. This "negative convexity" generally increases the interest rate exposure of our investment portfolio in excess of what is measured by duration alone. 
We estimate the duration and convexity of our assets using a third-party risk management system and market data. We review the estimates for reasonableness, giving consideration to any unique characteristics of our securities, market conditions and other factors likely to impact these estimates, and based on our judgement we may make adjustments to the third-party estimates. Our estimated duration gap, which is a measure of the difference between the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and our liabilities, inclusive of interest rate hedges, was 0.3 years as of December 31, 2024, compared to -0.5 years as of 2023.
The table below quantifies the estimated changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio (including derivatives and other securities used for hedging purposes) and in our tangible net book value per common share as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 should interest rates go up or down by 25, 50 and 75 basis points, assuming instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve and including the impact of both duration and convexity. All values in the table below are measured as percentage changes from the base interest rate scenario. The base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates and prepayment projections as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. 
To the extent that these estimates or other assumptions do not hold true, which may be more likely during periods of elevated market volatility, actual results could differ materially from our projections. Moreover, if different models were employed in the analysis, materially different projections could result. Lastly, while the table below reflects the estimated impact of interest rate changes on a static portfolio, we actively manage our portfolio, and we continuously adjust the size and composition of our asset and hedge portfolio.

Includes the effect of derivatives and other securities used for hedging purposes. Interest rates are assumed to be floored at 0% in down rate scenarios.
Prepayment Risk and Extension Risk
Prepayment risk is the risk that our assets will be repaid at a faster rate than anticipated. Interest rates and numerous other factors affect the rate of prepayments, such as housing prices, general economic conditions, loan age, size and loan-to-value ratios, and GSE buyouts of delinquent loans underlying our securities. Generally, declining mortgage rates increase the rate of prepayments, while rising rates have the opposite effect. 
If our assets prepay at a faster rate than anticipated, we may be unable to reinvest the repayments at acceptable yields. If the proceeds are reinvested at lower yields than our existing assets, our net interest income would be negatively impacted. We also amortize or accrete premiums and discounts we pay or receive at purchase relative to the stated principal of our assets into interest income over their projected lives using the effective interest method. If the actual and estimated future prepayment experience differs from our prior estimates, we are required to record an adjustment to interest income for the impact of the cumulative difference in the effective yield.
Extension risk is the risk that our assets will be repaid at a slower rate than anticipated and generally increases when interest rates rise. In a rising or higher interest rate environment, we may be required to finance our investments at potentially higher costs without the ability to reinvest principal into higher yielding securities as a result of borrowers prepaying their 
44
mortgages at a slower pace than originally anticipated, adversely impacting our net interest spread, and thus our net interest income.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our investment securities (excluding TBAs) had a weighted average projected CPR of 7.7% and 11.4%, respectively, and a weighted average yield of 4.77% and 4.41%, respectively. The table below presents estimated weighted average projected CPRs and yields for our investment securities should interest rates go up or down instantaneously by 25, 50 and 75 basis points. Estimated yields exclude the impact of retroactive "catch-up" premium amortization adjustments for prior periods due to changes in the projected CPR assumption.

Spread Risk
Spread risk is the risk that the market spread between the yield on our assets and the yield on benchmark interest rates linked to our interest rate hedges, such as U.S. Treasury rates and interest rate swap rates, may vary. As a levered investor in mortgage-backed securities, spread risk is an inherent component of our investment strategy. Therefore, although we use hedging instruments to attempt to protect against moves in interest rates, our hedges are generally not designed to protect against spread risk, and our tangible net book value could decline if spreads widen. 
Fluctuations in mortgage spreads can occur due to a variety of factors, including changes in interest rates, prepayment expectations, actual or anticipated monetary policy actions by the U.S. and foreign central banks, liquidity conditions, required rates of returns on different assets and other market supply and demand factors. The table below quantifies the estimated changes in the fair value of our assets, net of hedges, and our tangible net book value per common share as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 should spreads widen or tighten by 10, 25 and 50 basis points. The estimated impact of changes in spreads is in addition to our interest rate shock sensitivity included in the interest rate shock table above. The table below assumes a spread duration of 5.1 and 4.7 years as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, based on interest rates and prices as of such dates; however, our portfolio's sensitivity to mortgage spread changes will vary with changes in interest rates and in the size and composition of our portfolio. Therefore, actual results could differ materially from our estimates.

Liquidity Risk
Our liquidity risk principally arises from financing long-term fixed rate assets with shorter-term variable rate borrowings. Future borrowings are dependent upon the willingness of lenders to finance our investments, lender collateral requirements and the lenders’ determination of the fair value of the securities pledged as collateral, which fluctuates with changes in interest rates and liquidity conditions within the commercial banking and mortgage finance industries. 
As of December 31, 2024, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources available to execute our business strategy (see 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 in this Form 10-K for additional details). However, should the value of our collateral or the value of our derivative instruments suddenly decrease, or margin requirements increase, we may be required to post additional collateral for these arrangements, causing an adverse change in our liquidity position. Furthermore, there is no assurance that we will always be able to renew (or roll) our short-term funding liabilities. In addition, our counterparties have the option to increase our haircuts (margin requirements) on the assets we pledge against our funding liabilities, thereby reducing the amount that can be borrowed against an asset even if they agree to renew or roll our funding liabilities. Significantly higher haircuts can reduce our ability to leverage our portfolio or may even force us to sell assets, especially if correlated with asset price declines or faster prepayment rates on our assets. 
Credit Risk
Our credit sensitive investments, such as CRT and non-Agency securities, expose us to the risk of nonpayment of principal, interest or other remuneration we are contractually entitled to. We are also exposed to credit risk in the event our repurchase agreement counterparties default on their obligations to resell the underlying collateral back to us at the end of the repo term or in the event our derivative counterparties do not perform under the terms of our derivative agreements.
We accept credit exposure related to our credit sensitive assets at levels we deem prudent within the context of our overall investment strategy. We attempt to manage this risk through careful asset selection, pre-acquisition due diligence, post-acquisition performance monitoring, and the sale of assets where we identify negative credit trends. We may also manage credit risk with credit default swaps or other financial derivatives that we believe are appropriate. Additionally, we may vary the mix of our interest rate and credit sensitive assets or our duration gap to adjust our credit exposure and/or improve the return profile of our assets, such as when we believe credit performance is inversely correlated with changes in interest rates. Our credit risk related to derivative and repurchase agreement transactions is largely mitigated by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions with acceptable credit ratings or to registered central clearinghouses and monitoring concentration levels with any one counterparty. We also continuously monitor and adjust the amount of collateral pledged based on changes in market value. However, our efforts to manage credit risk may be unsuccessful and we could suffer losses as a result. Excluding central clearing exchanges, as of December 31, 2024, our maximum amount at risk with any counterparty related to our repurchase agreements and derivative agreements was less than 2% and less than 1%, respectively, of tangible stockholders' equity.

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and Board of Directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, utilizing the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in its Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on this assessment and those criteria, management determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report included in this Form 10-K.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of AGNC Investment Corp.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AGNC Investment Corp. (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 21, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter

Agency securities and non-agency securities of high credit quality net premium amortization
Description 
of the Matter
As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s investment securities had a net unamortized premium balance of $1.0 billion, including interest and principal-only securities, and it recorded $123 million of net premium amortization for the year then ended. As explained in Note 2 to the financial statements, premiums or discounts associated with the purchase of Agency residential mortgage-backed securities (“Agency RMBS") and non-Agency mortgage-backed securities of high credit quality are amortized or accreted into interest income, respectively, over the projected lives of the securities, including contractual payments and estimated prepayments using the effective interest method. The effective yield on the Company’s Agency RMBS and non-Agency mortgage-backed securities of high credit quality is highly impacted by the Company’s estimate of future prepayments. The Company estimates long-term prepayment speeds of such securities using a third-party service provider and market data. The third-party service provider estimates long-term prepayment speeds using a prepayment model that incorporates the forward yield curve, current mortgage rates, mortgage rates of the outstanding loans, age and size of the outstanding loans, loan-to-value ratios, interest rate volatility and other factors. 
Auditing the Company's estimation of long-term prepayment speeds used for the amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts is subjective due to the significant judgments and estimates required by management and the third-party service provider, as inputs into prepayment models are prone to fluctuation based on changing macroeconomic conditions. 
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the estimation of long-term prepayment speeds, including management’s review of the estimated prepayment speeds provided by the third-party service provider. 
Our audit procedures included, among others, performing comparative analyses between the Company’s long-term prepayment speed estimates and long-term prepayment speed estimates data from independent third-party sources, reconciling the Company’s estimates of long-term prepayment speeds to source prepayment speeds data provided by management’s third-party service provider, evaluating the competency and objectivity of management’s third-party service provider, and identifying potential sources of contrary information, with the assistance of an internal valuation specialist.

AGNC INVESTMENT CORP.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Note 1. 
Organization
AGNC Investment Corp. (referred throughout this report as the "Company," "we," "us" and "our") was organized in Delaware on January 7, 2008 and commenced operations on May 20, 2008 following the completion of our initial public offering. Our common stock is traded on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol "AGNC."
We are a leading provider of private capital to the U.S. housing market, enhancing liquidity in the residential real estate mortgage markets and, in turn, facilitating home ownership in the U.S. We invest primarily in Agency residential mortgage-backed securities ("Agency RMBS") for which the principal and interest payments are guaranteed by a U.S. Government-sponsored enterprise ("GSE") or a U.S. Government agency. We also invest in other types of mortgage and mortgage-related securities, such as credit risk transfer ("CRT") securities and non-Agency residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities ("non-Agency RMBS" and "CMBS," respectively), where repayment of principal and interest is not guaranteed by a GSE or U.S. Government agency, and other assets related to the housing, mortgage or real estate markets. We fund our investments primarily through collateralized borrowings structured as repurchase agreements. 
We operate to qualify to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Internal Revenue Code"). As a REIT, we are required to distribute annually 
90
% of our taxable income, and we will generally not be subject to U.S. federal or state corporate income tax to the extent that we distribute our annual taxable income to our stockholders on a timely basis. It is our intention to distribute 
100
% of our taxable income within the time limits prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code, which may extend into the subsequent tax year.

We are internally managed with the principal objective of generating favorable long-term stockholder returns with a substantial yield component. We generate income from the interest earned on our investments, net of associated borrowing and hedging costs, and net realized gains and losses on our investment and hedging activities.
Note 2. 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation and Consolidation
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries and variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. Significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Investment Securities
Agency RMBS consist of residential mortgage pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations ("CMOs") guaranteed by the Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae"), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac," and together with Fannie Mae, the "GSEs") or the Government National Mortgage Association ("Ginnie Mae").
CRT securities are risk sharing instruments issued by the GSEs, and similarly structured transactions issued by third-party market participants, that synthetically transfer a portion of the risk associated with credit losses within pools of conventional residential mortgage loans from the GSEs and/or third parties to private investors. Unlike Agency RMBS, full repayment of the original principal balance of CRT securities is not guaranteed by a GSE or U.S. Government agency; rather, "credit risk transfer" is achieved by writing down the outstanding principal balance of the CRT securities if credit losses on a related pool of loans exceed certain thresholds. By reducing the amount that they are obligated to repay to holders of CRT securities, the GSEs and/or other third parties offset credit losses on the related loans. 
Non-Agency RMBS and CMBS (together, "Non-Agency MBS") are backed by residential and commercial mortgage loans, respectively, packaged and securitized by a private institution, such as a commercial bank. Non-Agency MBS typically benefit from credit enhancements derived from structural elements, such as subordination, over-collateralization or insurance, but nonetheless carry a higher level of credit exposure than Agency RMBS. 
55
All of our securities are reported at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet. Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 320, 
Investments—Debt and Equity Securities
, requires that at the time of purchase, we designate a security as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading, depending on our ability and intent to hold such security to maturity. Alternatively, we may elect the fair value option of accounting for securities pursuant to ASC Topic 825, 
Financial Instruments
. Prior to fiscal year 2017, we primarily designated our investment securities as available-for-sale. On January 1, 2017, we began electing the fair value option of accounting for all investment securities newly acquired after such date. Unrealized gains and losses on securities classified as available-for-sale are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income ("OCI"), whereas unrealized gains and losses on securities for which we elected the fair value option, or are classified as trading, are reported in net income through other gain (loss). Upon the sale of a security designated as available-for-sale, we determine the cost of the security and the amount of unrealized gain or loss to reclassify out of accumulated OCI into earnings based on the specific identification method. In our view, the election of the fair value option simplifies the accounting for investment securities and more appropriately reflects the results of our operations for a reporting period by presenting the fair value changes for these assets in a manner consistent with the presentation and timing of the fair value changes for our derivative instruments.
We generally recognize gains or losses through net income on available-for-sale securities only if the security is sold; however, if the fair value of a security declines below its amortized cost and we determine that it is more likely than not that we will incur a realized loss on the security when we sell the asset, we will recognize the difference between the amortized cost and the fair value in net income as a component of other gain (loss). We did not recognize any loss on available for sale securities through net income that we held as of December 31, 2024 because, as of such date, we neither intended to sell any securities in an unrealized loss position nor was it more likely than not that we would be required to sell such securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. Since all of our available-for-sale designated securities consist of Agency RMBS, we do not have an allowance for credit losses. We have not recognized impairment losses on our available-for-sale securities through net income for the periods presented in our consolidated financial statements.

Interest Income
Interest income is accrued based on the outstanding principal amount of the investment securities and their contractual terms. Premiums or discounts associated with the purchase of Agency RMBS and non-Agency MBS of high credit quality are amortized or accreted into interest income, respectively, over the projected lives of the securities, including contractual payments and estimated prepayments, using the effective interest method in accordance with ASC Subtopic 310-20, 
Receivables—Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs
.
We estimate long-term prepayment speeds of our mortgage securities using a third-party service and market data. The third-party service provider estimates prepayment speeds using models that incorporate the forward yield curve, primary to secondary mortgage rate spreads, current mortgage rates, mortgage rates of the outstanding loans, age and size of the outstanding loans, loan-to-value ratios, interest rate volatility and other factors. We review the prepayment speeds estimated by the third-party service for reasonableness with consideration given to both historical prepayment speeds and current market conditions. If based on our assessment, we believe that the third-party model does not fully reflect our expectations of the current prepayment landscape we may make adjustments to the models. We review our actual and anticipated prepayment experience on at least a quarterly basis and effective yields are recalculated when differences arise between (i) our previous estimate of future prepayments and (ii) actual prepayments to date and our current estimate of future prepayments. We are required to record an adjustment in the current period to premium amortization / discount accretion for the cumulative effect of the difference in the effective yields as if the recalculated yield had been in place as of the security's acquisition date through the reporting date.
At the time we purchase CRT securities and non-Agency MBS that are not of high credit quality, we determine an effective yield based on our estimate of the timing and amount of future cash flows and our cost basis. Our initial cash flow estimates for these investments are based on our observations of current information and events and include assumptions related to interest rates, prepayment rates, collateral call provisions, and the impact of default and severity rates on the timing and amount of credit losses. On at least a quarterly basis, we review the estimated cash flows and make appropriate adjustments based on inputs and analysis received from external sources, internal models, and our judgment regarding such inputs and other factors. Any resulting changes in effective yield are recognized prospectively based on the current amortized cost of the investment adjusted for credit impairments, if any.
Repurchase Agreements

We finance the acquisition of securities for our investment portfolio primarily through repurchase agreements with our lending counterparties. Repurchase arrangements involve the sale and a simultaneous agreement to repurchase the securities at a future date. We maintain a beneficial interest in the specific securities pledged during the term of each repurchase arrangement 
56
and we receive the related principal and interest payments. Pursuant to ASC Topic 860, 
Transfers and Servicing
, we account for repurchase agreements as collateralized financing transactions, which are carried at their contractual amounts (cost), plus accrued interest. Our repurchase agreements typically have maturities of less than one year.
Reverse Repurchase Agreements and Obligation to Return Securities Borrowed under Reverse Repurchase Agreements
We borrow securities to cover short sales of U.S. Treasury securities through reverse repurchase transactions under our master repurchase agreements (see 
Derivative Instruments
 below). We account for these as securities borrowing transactions and recognize an obligation to return the borrowed securities at fair value on the balance sheet based on the value of the underlying borrowed securities as of the reporting date. We may also enter into reverse repurchase agreements to earn a yield on excess cash balances. The securities received as collateral in connection with our reverse repurchase agreements mitigate our credit risk exposure to counterparties. Our reverse repurchase agreements typically have maturities of 30 days or less.
Derivative Instruments
We use a variety of derivative instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to market risks, including interest rate, prepayment, extension and liquidity risks. The objective of our risk management strategy is to reduce fluctuations in net book value over a range of interest rate scenarios. In particular, we attempt to mitigate the risk of the cost of our variable rate liabilities increasing during a period of rising interest rates. The primary instruments that we use are interest rate swaps, options to enter into interest rate swaps ("swaptions"), U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. Treasury futures contracts. We also use forward contracts in the Agency RMBS "to-be-announced" market, or TBA securities, to invest in and finance Agency securities and to periodically reduce our exposure to Agency RMBS. 
We account for derivative instruments in accordance with ASC Topic 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging 
("ASC 815"). ASC 815 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets and to measure those instruments at fair value. None of our derivative instruments have been designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes under the provisions of ASC 815, consequently changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments are reported in gain (loss) on derivative instruments and other securities, net in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
Our derivative agreements generally contain provisions that allow for netting or setting off derivative assets and liabilities with the counterparty; however, we report related assets and liabilities on a gross basis in our consolidated balance sheets. Derivative instruments in a gain position are reported as derivative assets at fair value and derivative instruments in a loss position are reported as derivative liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. Changes in fair value of derivative instruments and periodic settlements related to our derivative instruments are recorded in gain (loss) on derivative instruments and other securities, net in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Net cash receipts from and payments on our derivative instruments are classified in our consolidated statements of cash flows according to the underlying nature or purpose of the derivative transaction, generally in the investing section. 
Interest rate swap agreements
We use interest rate swaps to economically hedge the variable cash flows associated with our borrowings made under repurchase agreements. Under our interest rate swap agreements, we typically pay a fixed rate and receive a floating rate ("payer swaps") based on a short-term benchmark rate, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") and Overnight Index Swap Rate ("OIS"). Our interest rate swaps typically have terms from one to 10 years. Our interest rate swaps are centrally cleared through a registered commodities exchange. The clearing exchange requires that we post an "initial margin" amount determined by the exchange. The initial margin amount is intended to be set at a level sufficient to protect the exchange from the interest rate swap's maximum estimated single-day price movement and is subject to adjustment based on changes in market volatility and other factors. We also exchange daily settlements of "variation margin" based upon changes in fair value, as measured by the exchange. Pursuant to rules governing central clearing activities, we recognize variation margin settlements as a direct reduction of the carrying value of the interest rate swap asset or liability. 
Interest rate swaptions
We purchase interest rate swaptions to help mitigate the potential impact of larger, more rapid changes in interest rates on the performance of our investment portfolio. Interest rate swaptions provide us the option to enter into an interest rate swap agreement for a predetermined notional amount, stated term and pay and receive interest rates in the future. Our interest rate swaption agreements are not subject to central clearing. The difference between the premium paid and the fair value of the swaption is reported in gain (loss) on derivative instruments and other securities, net in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. If a swaption expires unexercised, the realized loss on the swaption would be equal to the premium 
57
paid. If we sell or exercise a swaption, the realized gain or loss on the swaption would be equal to the difference between the cash or the fair value of the underlying interest rate swap and the premium paid.
TBA securities
A TBA security is a forward contract for the purchase or sale of Agency RMBS at a predetermined price, face amount, issuer, coupon and stated maturity on an agreed-upon future date. The specific Agency RMBS to be delivered into the contract are not known until shortly before the settlement date. We may choose, prior to settlement, to move the settlement of these securities out to a later date by entering into an offsetting TBA position, net settling the offsetting positions for cash, and simultaneously purchasing or selling a similar TBA contract for a later settlement date (together referred to as a "dollar roll transaction"). The Agency securities purchased or sold for a forward settlement date are typically priced at a discount to equivalent securities settling in the current month. This difference, or "price drop," is the economic equivalent of interest income on the underlying Agency securities, less an implied funding cost, over the forward settlement period (referred to as "dollar roll income"). Consequently, forward purchases of Agency securities and dollar roll transactions represent a form of off-balance sheet financing. 
We account for TBA contracts as derivative instruments since either the TBA contracts do not settle in the shortest period of time possible or we cannot assert that it is probable at inception and throughout the term of the TBA contract that we will physically settle the contract on the settlement date. We account for TBA dollar roll transactions as a series of derivative transactions. 
U.S. Treasury securities and US Treasury futures contracts
We use U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. Treasury futures contracts to mitigate the potential impact of changes in interest rates on the performance of our portfolio. We enter into short-sales of U.S. Treasury securities by borrowing the securities under reverse repurchase agreements and selling them into the market. We account for these as securities borrowing transactions and recognize an obligation to return the borrowed securities at fair value on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets based on the value of the underlying U.S. Treasury security as of the reporting date. Treasury futures contracts are standardized contracts that obligate us to sell or buy U.S. Treasury securities for future delivery. Gains and losses associated with U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. Treasury futures contracts are recognized in gain (loss) on derivative instruments and other securities, net in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
Fair Value Measurements

We determine the fair value of financial instruments based on our estimate of the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We utilize a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of the instrument as of the measurement date. We categorize a financial instrument within the hierarchy based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 
The three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows:
•
Level 1 Inputs —Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical unrestricted assets and liabilities in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date.
•
Level 2 Inputs —Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.
•
Level 3 Inputs —Instruments with primarily unobservable market data that cannot be corroborated.
The majority of our financial instruments are classified as Level 2 inputs. The availability of observable inputs can be affected by a wide variety of factors, including the type of instrument, whether the instrument is new and not yet established in the marketplace and other characteristics particular to the instrument. We typically obtain price estimates from multiple third-party pricing sources, such as pricing services and dealers, or, if applicable, from the registered clearing exchange. We make inquiries of third-party pricing sources to understand the significant inputs and assumptions they used to determine their prices and that they are derived from orderly transactions, particularly during periods of elevated market turbulence and reduced market liquidity. We also review third-party price estimates and perform procedures to validate their reasonableness, including an analysis of the range of estimates for each position, comparison to recent trade activity for similar securities and for consistency with market conditions observed as of the measurement date. While we do not adjust prices we obtain from pricing sources, we will exclude prices for securities from our estimation of fair value if we determine based on our validation procedures and our market knowledge and expertise that the price is significantly different from what observable market data 
58
would indicate and we cannot obtain an understanding from the third-party source as to the significant inputs used to determine the price.
The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis classified as Level 2 inputs. These instruments trade in active markets such that participants transact with sufficient frequency and volume to provide transparent pricing information on an ongoing basis. The liquidity of these markets and the similarity of our instruments to those actively traded enable our pricing sources and us to utilize the observed quoted prices as a basis for formulating fair value measurements. 
Investment securities
 - are valued based on prices obtained from multiple third-party pricing sources. The pricing sources utilize various valuation approaches, including market and income approaches. For Agency RMBS, the pricing sources primarily utilize a matrix pricing technique that interpolates the estimated fair value based on observed quoted prices for TBA securities having the same coupon, maturity and issuer, adjusted to reflect the specific characteristics of the pool of mortgages underlying the Agency security, such as maximum loan balance, loan vintage, loan-to-value ratio, geography and other characteristics as may be appropriate. For other investment securities, the pricing sources primarily utilize discounted cash flow model-derived pricing techniques to estimate the fair value. Such models incorporate market-based discount rate assumptions based on observable inputs such as recent trading activity, credit data, volatility statistics, benchmark interest rate curves, spread measurements to benchmark curves and other market data that are current as of the measurement date and may include certain unobservable inputs, such as assumptions of future levels of prepayment, defaults and loss severities. 
TBA securities
 - are valued using prices obtained from third-party pricing sources based on pricing models that reference recent trading activity.
Interest rate swaps
 - are valued using the daily settlement price, or fair value, determined by the clearing exchange based on a pricing model that references observable market inputs, including current benchmark rates and the forward yield curve. 
Interest rate swaptions
 - are valued using prices obtained from the counterparty and other third-party pricing models. The pricing models are based on the value of the future interest rate swap that we have the option to enter into as well as the remaining length of time that we have to exercise the option based on observable market inputs, adjusted for non-performance risk, if any. 
U.S. Treasury securities and futures are valued based on quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets and are classified as Level 1 assets. None of our financial instruments are classified as Level 3 inputs.

Consolidated Variable Interest Entities
ASC Topic 810,
 Consolidation
 ("ASC 810"), requires an enterprise to consolidate a variable interest entity ("VIE") if it is deemed the primary beneficiary of the VIE. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our consolidated financial statements reflect the consolidation of certain VIEs for which we have determined we are the primary beneficiary. The consolidated VIEs consist of CMO trusts backed by fixed or adjustable-rate Agency RMBS. Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac guarantees the payment of interest and principal and acts as the trustee and administrator of their respective securitization trusts. Accordingly, we are not required to provide the beneficial interest holders of the CMO securities any financial or other support. Our maximum exposure to loss related to our involvement with the CMO trusts is the fair value of the CMO securities and interest and principal-only securities held by us, less principal amounts guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash held in bank accounts and cash held in money market funds on an overnight basis.
Restricted Cash
Restricted cash includes cash pledged as collateral for clearing and executing trades, repurchase agreements, and interest rate swaps and other derivative instruments.

Goodwill
Goodwill is the cost of an acquisition in excess of the fair value of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed and is recognized as an asset on our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $
526
 million of goodwill related to our acquisition of AGNC Management, LLC, our former manager, on July 1, 2016. Goodwill is not subject to amortization but must be tested for impairment at least annually and at interim periods when events or circumstances may make it more likely than not that an impairment has occurred. If a qualitative analysis indicates that there may be an impairment, a quantitative analysis is performed. The quantitative analysis requires that we compare the carrying value of the 
59
identified reporting unit comprising the goodwill to the reporting unit's fair value. If the reporting unit's carrying value is greater than its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. During the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2024, we did not recognize a goodwill impairment charge.

Stock-Based Compensation 
Under our Amended and Restated AGNC Investment Corp. 2016 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2016 Equity Plan" or "the Plan"), we may grant equity-based compensation to our officers and other employees and non-employee directors for the purpose of providing incentives and rewards for service or performance. Stock-based awards issued under the Plan include time-based and performance-based restricted stock unit awards ("RSU" and "PSU" awards, respectively), but may include other forms of equity-based compensation. RSU and PSU awards are an agreement to issue an equivalent number of shares of our common stock, plus any equivalent shares for dividends declared on our common stock, at the time the award vests, or later if distribution of such shares has been deferred beyond the vesting date. RSU awards vest over a specified service period. PSU awards vest over a specified service period subject to achieving long-term performance criteria. 
We measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards made to employees and non-employee directors based on their fair values. We value RSU and PSU awards based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. Compensation expense is recognized over each award’s respective service period. For PSU awards, we estimate the probability that the performance criteria will be achieved and recognize expense only for those awards expected to vest. We reevaluate our estimates each reporting period and recognize a cumulative effect adjustment to expense if our estimates change from the prior period. We do not estimate forfeiture rates; rather, we adjust for forfeitures in the periods in which they occur. 
Shares underlying RSU and PSU awards are issued when the awards vest, or later if distribution of such shares has been deferred beyond the vest date. Shares issued are net of shares withheld to cover minimum statutory tax withholding obligations. The fair value of shares withheld for tax withholdings is recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
We consider the applicability and impact of all ASUs issued by the FASB. There are no unadopted ASUs that are expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements when adopted or other recently adopted ASUs that had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
Note 3. 
Investment Securities
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our investment portfolio consisted of $66.3 billion and $54.8 billion investment securities, at fair value, respectively, $
6.9
 billion and $
5.4
 billion net TBA securities, at fair value, respectively, and other mortgage credit investments of $
64
 million and $
44
 million, respectively, which we account for under the equity method of accounting. Our TBA position is reported at its net carrying value totaling $(
26
) million and $
66
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, in derivative assets / (liabilities) on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The net carrying value of our TBA position represents the difference between the fair value of the underlying security and the cost basis or the forward price to be paid or received for the underlying security. 
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our investment securities had a net unamortized premium balance of $
1.0
 billion and $
1.2

Our CRT securities reference the performance of loans underlying Agency RMBS issued by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, which were subject to their underwriting standards. 
The actual maturities of our investment securities are generally shorter than their stated contractual maturities. The actual maturities of our Agency and high credit quality non-Agency RMBS are primarily affected by principal prepayments and to a lesser degree the contractual lives of the underlying mortgages and periodic contractual principal repayments. The actual maturities of our credit-oriented investments are primarily impacted by their contractual lives and default and loss recovery rates. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the weighted average expected constant prepayment rate ("CPR") over the remaining life of our Agency and high credit quality non-Agency RMBS investment portfolio was 
7.7
% and 
11.4
%, respectively. Our estimates can differ materially for different securities and thus our individual holdings have a wide range of projected CPRs.

Note 4. 
Repurchase Agreements and Reverse Repurchase Agreements
Repurchase Agreements
We pledge our securities as collateral under our borrowings structured as repurchase agreements with financial institutions. Amounts available to be borrowed are dependent upon the fair value of the securities pledged as collateral, which fluctuates with changes in interest rates, type of security and liquidity conditions within the banking, mortgage finance and real estate industries. If the fair value of our pledged securities declines, lenders will typically require us to post additional collateral or pay down borrowings to re-establish agreed upon collateral requirements, referred to as "margin calls." Similarly, if the fair value of our pledged securities increases, lenders may release collateral back to us. As of December 31, 2024, we had met all margin call requirements. For additional information regarding our pledged assets, please refer to Note 6. 
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $
60.8
 billion and $
50.4
 billion, respectively, of repurchase agreements outstanding used to fund our investment portfolio and temporary holdings of U.S. Treasury securities. The terms and conditions of our repurchase agreements are typically negotiated on a transaction-by-transaction basis or subject to a tri-party repo agreement. 
The following table summarizes our borrowings under repurchase agreements by their remaining maturities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions):

17.3
 billion of forward commitments to enter into repurchase agreements with a weighted average forward start date of 
2
 days and a weighted average interest rate of 
4.61

%. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
50
% and 
48
%, respectively, of our repurchase agreement funding was sourced through our wholly-owned captive broker-dealer subsidiary, Bethesda Securities, LLC ("BES"). Amounts sourced through BES include funding from the General Collateral Finance Repo service ("GCF Repo") offered by the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation ("FICC"), which totaled 
47
% and 
43
% of our repurchase agreement funding outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
Reverse Repurchase Agreements
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $17.1 billion and $11.6 billion, respectively, of reverse repurchase agreements outstanding used primarily to borrow securities to cover short sales of U.S. Treasury securities, for which we had associated obligations to return borrowed securities at fair value of $16.7 billion and $10.9 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, $
3.9
 billion and $
3.1
 billion, respectively, of our reverse repurchase agreements were with the FICC sourced through BES.

Note 5. 
Derivative and Other Hedging Instruments
For the periods presented, our interest rate based hedges primarily consisted of interest rate swaps, interest rate swaptions, U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. Treasury futures contracts. We also utilized forward contracts, primarily consisting of TBA securities, for the purchase and sale of investment securities. For additional information regarding our derivative instruments and our overall risk management strategy, please refer to the discussion of derivative and other hedging instruments in Note 2.

Net carrying value represents the difference between the fair market value and the cost basis (or the forward price to be paid/(received) for the underlying Agency security) of the TBA contract as of period-end and is reported in derivative assets/(liabilities), at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we held SOFR futures contracts with a long notional position of $
1.2
 billion and $
0.9
 billion, respectively, measured on a two-year swap equivalent basis, with a net carrying value of $(
7
) million and $(
10
) million, respectively.
As of December 31, 2023, we held centrally cleared credit default swaps ("CDS") with a notional value of $
95
 million that referenced the Markit CDX Investment Grade or High Yield Grade Index, maturing in December 2028. Under the terms of these contracts, we made fixed periodic payments equal to 1% per annum of the notional value and we were entitled to receive payments in the event of qualifying credit events. As of December 31, 2023, the credit default swaps had a market value of $(
6
) million and a carrying value of zero dollars, net of variation margin settlements. Pursuant to rules governing central clearing activities, we recognized variation margin settlements as a direct reduction of the carrying value of the CDS asset or liability.

Note 6. 
Pledged Assets
Our funding agreements require us to fully collateralize our obligations under the agreements based upon our counterparties' collateral requirements and their determination of the fair value of the securities pledged as collateral, which 
68
fluctuates with changes in interest rates, credit quality and liquidity conditions within the investment banking, mortgage finance and real estate industries. Our derivative contracts similarly require us to fully collateralize our obligations under such agreements, which will vary over time based on similar factors as well as our counterparties' determination of the value of the derivative contract. We are typically required to post initial margin upon execution of derivative transactions, such as under our interest rate swap agreements and TBA contracts, and subsequently post or receive variation margin based on daily fluctuations in fair value. Our brokerage and custody agreements and the clearing organizations utilized by our wholly-owned captive broker-dealer subsidiary, Bethesda Securities, LLC, also require that we post minimum daily clearing deposits. If we breach our collateral requirements, we will be required to fully settle our obligations under the agreements, which could include a forced liquidation of our pledged collateral. 
Our counterparties also apply a "haircut" to our pledged collateral, which means our collateral is valued at slightly less than market value and limits the amount we can borrow against our securities. This haircut reflects the underlying risk of the specific collateral and protects our counterparty against a change in its value. Our agreements do not specify the haircut; rather, haircuts are determined on an individual transaction basis. Consequently, our funding agreements and derivative contracts expose us to credit risk relating to potential losses that could be recognized if our counterparties fail to perform their obligations under such agreements. We minimize this risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions with acceptable credit ratings or to registered clearinghouses and U.S. government agencies, and we monitor our positions with individual counterparties. In the event of a default by a counterparty, we may have difficulty obtaining our assets pledged as collateral to such counterparty and may not receive payments as and when due to us under the terms of our derivative agreements. In the case of centrally cleared instruments, we could be exposed to credit risk if the central clearing agency or a clearing member defaults on its respective obligation to perform under the contract. However, we believe that the risk is minimal due to the clearing exchanges' initial and daily mark-to-market margin requirements, clearinghouse guarantee funds and other resources that are available in the event of a clearing member default. 
As of December 31, 2024, our maximum amount at risk with any counterparty related to our repurchase agreements, excluding the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, was less than 
2
% of our tangible stockholders' equity (or the excess/shortfall of the value of collateral pledged/received over our repurchase agreement liabilities/reverse repurchase agreement receivables). As of December 31, 2024, 
9
% of our tangible stockholder's equity was at risk with the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation.

Offsetting Assets and Liabilities 
Certain of our repurchase agreements and derivative transactions are governed by underlying agreements that generally provide for a right of setoff under master netting arrangements (or similar agreements), including in the event of default or in the event of bankruptcy of either party to the transactions. We present our assets and liabilities subject to such arrangements on a gross basis in our consolidated balance sheets. 
The following tables present information about our assets and liabilities that are subject to master netting arrangements and can potentially be offset on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 (in millions):

________________________________
1.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the net fair value of our interest rate swaps excluding the recognition of variation margin settlements as a direct reduction of carrying value was a net asset (liability) of $
2.3
 billion and $
2.9
 billion, respectively, based on "Level 2" inputs. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the net fair value of our credit default swaps excluding the recognition of variation margin settlements was a net asset (liability) of $
0
 million and $(
6
) million, respectively, based on "Level 2" inputs. See Notes 2 and 5 for additional details.
Excluded from the table above are financial instruments reported at cost and other mortgage credit investments reported under the equity method of accounting in our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair value of our repurchase agreements approximated cost, given their short-term nature (less than one year) and the rates on our outstanding repurchase agreements largely corresponded to prevailing rates observed in the repo market. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, receivables and other payables were determined to approximate cost as of such dates due to their short duration. We estimate the fair value of these instruments carried at cost using "Level 1" or "Level 2" inputs. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the carrying value of other mortgage credit investments reported under the equity method of accounting was $
64
 million and $
44
 million, respectively.

Note 8. 
Net Income (Loss) Per Common Share 
Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing (i) net income (loss) available (attributable) to common stockholders by (ii) the sum of our weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and the weighted-average number of vested but not yet issued time- and performance-based restricted stock units ("RSUs") that were outstanding during the period, which were granted under our long-term incentive program to employees and non-employee members of the Board of Directors ("the Board"). Diluted net income (loss) per common share assumes the issuance of all potential common stock equivalents unless doing so would reduce a loss or increase income per common share. Our potential common stock equivalents consist of unvested time- and performance-based RSUs. The following table presents the computations of basic and diluted net income (loss) per common share for the periods indicated (shares and dollars in millions):

Our preferred stock ranks senior to our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon a voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. Our preferred stock has no stated maturity, is not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption and each series of preferred stock ranks on parity with one another. Under certain circumstances upon a change of control, our preferred stock is convertible to shares of our common stock. Holders of our preferred stock and depositary shares underlying our preferred stock have no voting rights, except under limited conditions. Beginning on each series' optional redemption date, we may redeem shares at $
25.00
 per depositary share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends (whether or not declared), exclusively at our option.

Note 10. 
Segment Reporting
Our investment portfolio consists primarily of Agency RMBS, and we fund our investments primarily through collateralized borrowings structured as repurchase agreements. As part of our operations, we are exposed to market risks, including interest rate, prepayment, extension, spread, and credit risks.
76
Our portfolio is managed as a whole, with investment and hedging decisions assessed collectively by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM). The CODM, represented by our Chief Executive Officer with the support of our Executive Management Committee, allocates resources and evaluates financial performance by considering the market risks identified above. The CODM also considers factors such as total assets and repurchase agreements outstanding, as reported on the consolidated balance sheet; our TBA position, as disclosed in Note 5. 
Derivative and Other Hedging Instruments
; our ability to hedge certain risks; and our intention to qualify as a REIT. Consequently, the Company operates as a single reportable segment, as reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes.
The CODM assesses performance using comprehensive income (loss), as reported on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss). Comprehensive income (loss) is a key determinant of the Company’s economic return, calculated as the change in tangible stockholders’ equity attributable to common stockholders plus common stock dividends declared, divided by the prior period’s tangible stockholders’ equity attributable to common stockholders. This measure is used to monitor actual results, benchmark performance against peers, and inform management’s compensation. Additionally, the CODM also evaluates consolidated expense information, including interest expense, compensation and benefits, and other operating expenses, as significant metrics in decision-making.
Note 11. 
Stock-Based Compensation
During fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, we granted RSU awards to employees with a grant date fair value of $
10
 million, $
11
 million and $
8
 million, respectively, which generally vest annually over a three-year period, and we granted RSU awards to independent directors of $
1.2
 million, $
1.2
 million and $
1.0
 million, respectively, which vest at the end of a one-year period from grant date. We also granted PSU awards to employees which generally vest at the end of a three-year period provided that specified performance criteria are met. The performance criteria are based on a formula tied to our achievement of long-term economic returns consisting of the change in tangible net book value and dividends paid per common share on an absolute basis and relative to a select group of our peers. The fair value of the PSU awards granted during fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022 as of the grant date was $
10
 million, $
10
 million and $
11
 million, respectively, assuming the target levels of performance are achieved. The actual value of the awards will vary within a range of 0% to 200% of the target based on the actual performance achieved relative to the targets.
Our 2016 Equity Plan, as amended, authorizes a total of 
40
 million shares of our common stock that may be used to satisfy awards granted under the Plan, subject to the share counting rules set forth within the Plan. As of December 31, 2024, 
26.0
 million shares remained available for awards under the 2016 Equity Plan. For purposes of determining the total number of shares available for awards under the 2016 Equity Plan, available shares are reduced by (i) shares issued for vested awards, net of units withheld to cover minimum statutory tax withholding requirements paid by us in cash on behalf of the employee, (ii) outstanding unvested awards, (iii) outstanding previously vested awards, if distribution of such awards has been deferred beyond the vesting date ("deferred awards"), and (iv) accrued dividend equivalent units on outstanding awards through December 31, 2024. Unvested PSU awards assume the maximum potential payout under the terms of the award. As of December 31, 2024, 
2.0
 million of deferred awards, including accrued dividend equivalents, were outstanding.
During fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized total compensation expense of $
23.5
 million, $
15.0
 million and $
11.6
 million, respectively, for stock-based awards to employees, and we recognized other operating expense of $
1.2
 million, $
1.1
 million and $
1.0
 million, respectively, for stock-based awards to independent directors. Compensation expense for PSU awards is based on our estimate of the probability that the performance criteria for PSU awards will be achieved and, if applicable, includes a cumulative effect adjustment for changes in our estimate from the prior year period. As of December 31, 2024, we estimate that 
75.5
% of target for PSU awards granted in fiscal year 2022 will vest based on actual performance achieved through the end of the performance measurement period and that 
115
% and 
100
% of target will vest for PSU awards granted in fiscal years 2023 and 2024, respectively, based on our estimate of the probability that the performance criteria for these awards will be achieved. As of December 31, 2024, we had $
18
 million of unrecognized expense related to stock-based awards that we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of 
1.4
 years.

As of December 31, 2024, we estimate that 
115.0
% and 
100.0
% of the 2023 and 2024 PSU awards, respectively, will vest based on our estimate of the probability that the performance criteria for the awards will be achieved.

Income Taxes
We did not incur an income tax liability for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 and we do not expect to incur an income tax liability for the year ended December 31, 2024.
