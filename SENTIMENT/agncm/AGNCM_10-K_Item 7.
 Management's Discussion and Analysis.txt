EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
We are a leading provider of private capital to the U.S. housing market, enhancing liquidity in the residential real estate mortgage markets and, in turn, facilitating home ownership in the U.S. We invest primarily in Agency RMBS on a leveraged basis. These investments consist of residential mortgage pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations for which the principal and interest payments are guaranteed by a U.S. Government-sponsored enterprise, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, or by a U.S. Government agency, such as Ginnie Mae. We may also invest in other assets related to the housing, mortgage or real estate markets that are not guaranteed by a GSE or U.S. Government agency.
We are internally managed with the principal objective of generating favorable long-term stockholder returns with a substantial yield component. We generate income from the interest earned on our investments, net of associated borrowing and hedging costs, and net realized gains and losses on our investment and hedging activities. We fund our investments primarily through collateralized borrowings structured as repurchase agreements. We operate in a manner to qualify to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. 
We employ an active management strategy that is dynamic and responsive to evolving market conditions. The composition of our portfolio and our investment, funding, and hedging strategies are tailored to reflect our analysis of market conditions and the relative values of available options. Market conditions are influenced by a variety of factors, including interest rates, prepayment expectations, liquidity, housing prices, unemployment rates, general economic conditions, government participation in the mortgage market, regulations and relative returns on other assets. 
Trends and Recent Market Impacts
In 2024, an increasingly favorable market environment for Agency RMBS investors emerged as the Fed pivoted from its restrictive monetary policy and began lowering short-term rates toward a neutral level. Declining inflationary pressures and the Fed’s more accommodative monetary policy helped reduce interest rate volatility and steepen the yield curve. These dynamics provided an improved investment backdrop that enabled AGNC to generate a positive economic return of 13.2% in 2024, comprised of our monthly dividends totaling $1.44 per common share for the year and a modest decline of our tangible net book value of $0.29 per common share.
The U.S. presidential election and its implications for deficit spending, fiscal policy and future Treasury issuance tempered the positive investment sentiment that existed during the first three quarters of the year.  In addition, strong economic data late in the fourth quarter extended the Fed’s anticipated easing timeline as evidenced by its December Summary of Economic Projections, which indicated fewer expected rate cuts in 2025 and 2026 than previously projected.
Looking forward, our outlook for Agency mortgage-backed securities in 2025 remains very favorable. We anticipate that Agency RMBS spreads relative to benchmark rates will remain wide compared to historical averages and continue to trade within the well-defined range that has been established over the past several quarters. Agency RMBS spreads to benchmark rates in the current range offer investors attractive return opportunities. Further, longer-term interest rates have risen meaningfully, and as of year-end, the 30-year primary mortgage rate was once again near 7%. At current rate levels, we expect the supply of Agency RMBS in 2025 to be similar to that of 2024 and reasonably well-aligned with investor demand. Potential increases in bank demand as regulatory constraints ease could also provide incremental additional support for Agency RMBS valuations. Together, these positive dynamics create a constructive investment backdrop for AGNC in 2025.

Notwithstanding our favorable outlook for Agency RMBS as we begin 2025, financial market and macroeconomic uncertainty remains elevated as the new administration implements sweeping changes to tariff, immigration, fiscal, and regulatory policy. In addition, while GSE reform does not appear to be an immediate focus of the administration, it is possible that this topic could be revisited at some point during the next four years.  Favorably in our view, there also appears to be a growing consensus that any change to the structure of the GSE’s and the Agency RMBS market should be done in a way that preserves the current functionality of the conventional mortgage market, avoids disrupting the real estate market and ensures that housing affordability does not decline further.
