Market Information and Holders

Bancorp’s common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “CATY.” As of February 14, 2025, Bancorp had outstanding approximately 70,285,292 shares of common stock with approximately 1,440 holders of record. Bancorp believes, however, that the actual number of beneficial holders of its common stock may be substantially greater than the stated number of holders of record because a substantial portion of the common stock is held in street name.
