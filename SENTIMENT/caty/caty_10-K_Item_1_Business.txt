Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
 Cathay General Bancorp:

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cathay General Bancorp and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control 
–
 Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 28, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Allowance for loan losses for loans evaluated on a collective basis modeled using an econometric methodology.

As discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s total allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2024 was $161.8 million, a substantial portion of which relates to the allowance for loan losses on loans evaluated on a collective basis over residential mortgages, commercial and industrial loans, construction loans, commercial real estate for multifamily loans, commercial real estate for owner-occupied loans, and other commercial real estate loans (hereafter “six portfolios”). As discussed in Note 1, the collective ALL includes the measure of expected credit losses on a collective basis by pooling those loans that share similar risk characteristics into these six portfolios. The collective ALL methodology uses historical credit loss experience as a basis for estimation of expected credit losses at the collective pool basis over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. The Company calculates the collective ALL by estimating the probability of default during the reasonable and supportable forecast period using separate econometric regression models developed to correlate macroeconomic variables to loan risk rating performance for each of the six portfolios. Loss given default rates are computed based on the net charge-offs recognized and then applied to the expected exposure at default of defaulted loans. The probability of default and the loss given default rates are applied to the expected amount at default at the loan level based on contractual scheduled payments and estimated prepayments. The collective ALL incorporates reasonable and supportable forecasts of various macroeconomic variables over a two-year reasonable and supportable forecast period, reverting linearly to long-term loss rates over the one-year reversion period. Management relies on multiple forecasts, which are weighted in determining a single loss estimate. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics as well as for changes in environmental conditions. The adjustments, or qualitative loss factors, consider idiosyncratic risk factors, conditions that may not be reflected in quantitatively derived results, or other relevant factors to seek to ensure the allowance for credit losses reflects the Company’s best estimate of current expected credit losses.

We identified the assessment of the collective ALL as a critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and knowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment due to significant measurement uncertainty. This included our assessment of the collective ALL methodology, including the econometric models used to estimate expected credit losses and their significant assumptions. Such significant assumptions included portfolio segmentation, the weighting of the economic forecast scenarios, the selection of macroeconomic variables, the length of the reasonable and supportable forecast period, and risk ratings. The assessment also included the evaluation of the qualitative loss factors. In addition, auditor judgment was required to evaluate the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained.

      F-2

Table of Contents

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company’s measurement of the collective ALL, including controls related to the:

●

continued use and appropriateness of the collective ALL methodology

●

continued use and appropriateness of the econometric models

●

identification and determination of the significant assumptions used in the econometric models

●

continued use and appropriateness of changes in certain qualitative loss factors

●

determination of risk ratings

●

analysis of the collective ALL results, trends, and ratios.

We evaluated the Company’s process to develop the collective ALL by testing certain sources of data, factors, and assumptions used, and considered the relevance and reliability of such data, factors, and assumptions. In addition, we involved credit risk professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:

●

evaluating the collective ALL methodology for compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles

●

evaluating judgments made relative to the development and performance monitoring of the econometric models by comparing them to Company-specific metrics and trends and the applicable industry and regulatory practices

●

assessing the conceptual soundness and performance testing of the econometric models by inspecting the model validation documentation to determine whether the models are suitable for their intended use

●

evaluating the judgments made by the Company in selecting the macroeconomic variables, including the reasonable and supportable forecast period and economic scenario weightings used, by comparing them to the Company’s business environment and relevant industry practice

●

determining whether the loan portfolio is segmented by similar risk characteristics by comparing to specific portfolio risk characteristics and trends

●

testing individual risk ratings for a selection of loans by evaluating the financial performance of the borrower, sources of repayment, and any relevant guarantees or underlying collateral

●

evaluating the methodology used to develop certain qualitative loss factors and the effect of those qualitative loss factors on the collective ALL compared with relevant credit risk factors and consistency with credit trends and identified limitations of the econometric models.

We also assessed the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained related to the collective ALL by evaluating the:

●

cumulative results of the audit procedures

●

qualitative aspects of the Company’s accounting practices

●

potential bias in the accounting estimates

CATHAY GENERAL BANCORP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Cathay General Bancorp (the “Bancorp”), a Delaware corporation, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Cathay Bank (the “Bank”), a California state-chartered bank, and 
eleven
 limited partnerships investing in affordable housing projects (together, the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and general practices within the banking industry.

Organization and Background
.

The Bancorp’s primary business is to act as the holding company for the Bank.

The Bank is a commercial bank, servicing primarily the individuals, professionals, and small to medium-sized businesses in the local markets in which its branches are located. Its operations include the acceptance of checking, savings, and time deposits, and the making of commercial, real estate, and consumer loans. The Bank also offers trade financing, letters of credit, wire transfer, foreign currency spot and forward contracts, Internet banking, investment services, and other customary banking services to its clients. The Bank owns 
100
% of the common securities of Cathay Holdings LLC.

Use of Estimates. 
The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP requires management of the Company to make several estimates and assumptions relating to the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The significant estimates subject to change relate to the allowance for credit losses.

Concentrations. 
The Bank was incorporated in California and started its business from California. Therefore, loans originated, and deposits solicited were mainly from California. As of 
 December 31, 2024
, gross loans were primarily comprised of 
51.8
% of commercial real estate loans, 
29.4
% of residential mortgage loans, and 
16.0
% of commercial loans. As of 
 December 31, 2024
, approximately 
49.2
% of the Bank’s residential mortgages were for properties located in California.

Securities Available for Sale.
 Debt securities Available For Sale (“AFS”) are measured at fair value and subject to impairment testing. When an AFS debt security is considered impaired, the Company must determine if the decline in fair value has resulted from a credit-related loss or other factors and then, (
1
) recognize an allowance for credit loss by a charge to earnings for the credit-related component (if any) of the decline in fair value, and (
2
) recognize in other comprehensive income (loss) any non-credit related components of the fair value change. If the amount of the amortized cost basis expected to be recovered increases in a future period, the valuation reserve would be reduced, but 
not
 more than the amount of the current existing reserve for that security.

Interest income includes amortization of premiums and discounts as an adjustment of yield on a level-yield basis. Premiums on callable debt securities are amortized to their earliest call date. Gains and losses on sales are recorded on the trade date and determined using the specific identification method.

A debt security is placed on nonaccrual status at the time any principal or interest payments become delinquent by 
90
 days or greater. Interest accrued but 
not
 received for a security placed on non-accrual is reversed against interest income. 
No
 interest was reversed against interest income during the period.

Allowance for Credit Losses on Available for Sale Securities. 
For AFS debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company 
first
 assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more likely than 
not
 that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If an entity intends to sell the debt security, or more likely than 
not
 will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, any allowance for credit losses shall be written off and the amortized cost basis shall be written down to the debt security's fair value at the reporting date with any incremental impairment reported in earnings. For AFS debt securities that do 
not
 meet the aforementioned criteria, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, the payment structure of the security, failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. Any fair value changes that have 
not
 been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income.

Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for credit loss expense. Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of an available-for-sale security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met.

The amortized cost of the Company’s AFS debt securities exclude accrued interest, which is included in “accrued interest receivable” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company has made an accounting policy election 
not
 to measure an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivables on AFS debt securities since the Company timely reverses any previously accrued interest when the debt security remains in default for an extended period. As each AFS debt security has a unique security structure, where the accrual status is clearly determined when certain criteria listed in the terms are met, the Company assesses the default status of each security as defined by the debt security’s specific security structure.

Trading securities
 are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses included in income.

Investment in Federal Home Loan Bank (
“
FHLB
”
) Stock.

 As a member of the FHLB system the Bank is required to maintain an investment in the capital stock of the FHLB.  The amount of investment is also affected by the outstanding advances under the line of credit the Bank maintains with the FHLB. FHLB stock is carried at cost and is pledged as collateral to the FHLB.  FHLB stock is periodically evaluated for impairment based on ultimate recovery of par value.  The carrying amount of the FHLB stock were $
17.3
 million and $
17.7
 million at 
 December 31, 
2024
, and 
2023
, respectively. As of 
 December 31, 
2024
, the Company owned 
172,500
 shares of FHLB stock, which exceeded the minimum stock requirement of 
150,000
 shares.

        NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)

Loans Held for Investment. 
Loans receivable that the Company has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity are stated at their outstanding principal, reduced by an allowance for loan losses and net of deferred loan fees or costs on originated loans and unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans. Nonrefundable fees and direct costs associated with the origination or purchase of loans are deferred and netted against outstanding loan balances. The deferred net loan fees and costs are recognized in interest income as an adjustment to yield over the loan term using the effective interest method or straight-line method. Discounts or premiums on purchased loans are accreted or amortized to interest income using the effective interest method or straight-line method over the remaining period to contractual maturity. Interest on loans is calculated using the simple-interest method on daily balances of the principal amounts outstanding based on an actual or 
360
-day basis.

Generally, loans are placed on nonaccrual status when they become 
90
 days past due. Loans are considered past due when contractually required principal or interest payments have 
not
 been made on the due dates. Loans are also placed on nonaccrual status when management believes, after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts, that the borrower’s financial condition is such that full collection of principal or interest becomes uncertain, regardless of the length of past due status. Once a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, interest accrual is discontinued, and all unpaid accrued interest is reversed against interest income. As a result, accrued interest receivable does 
not
 carry a credit loss reserve. Interest payments received on nonaccrual loans are reflected as a reduction of principal and 
not
 as interest income. A loan is returned to accrual status when the borrower has demonstrated a satisfactory payment trend subject to management’s assessment of the borrower’s ability to repay the loan.

Loans held for sale
. Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value. Gains and losses are recorded in non-interest income based on the difference between sales proceeds, net of sales commissions, and carrying value. When a determination is made at the time of commitment to originate or purchase loans as held-for-investment, it is the Company’s intent to hold these loans to maturity or for the “foreseeable future,” subject to periodic review under the Company’s management evaluation processes, including asset/liability management. When the Company subsequently changes its intent to hold certain loans, the loans are transferred from the loans held-for-investment portfolio at amortized cost to the loans held-for-sale portfolio at lower of aggregate cost or fair value and the existing ACL on the loans transferred is reversed.

Allowance for Credit Losses (
“
ACL
”
) on Loans Held for Investment.
 The Company uses the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) approach for financial instruments measured at amortized cost and other commitments to extend credit. CECL requires the immediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur over the estimated remaining life of the asset. The forward-looking concept of CECL requires loss estimates to consider historical experience, adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts, which 
 may 
include forecasts of items such as GDP, unemployment rates, CRE and home price indexes, and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts of future events and circumstances.

The ACL is the combination of the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded loan commitments. The allowance for loan losses is reported as a reduction of the amortized cost basis of loans, while the reserve for unfunded loan commitments is included within "other liabilities" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amortized cost basis of loans does 
not
 include accrued interest receivable, which is included in "accrued interest receivable" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The "Provision for credit losses" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income is a combination of the provision for loan losses and the provision for unfunded loan commitments.

Under the Company’s CECL approach, management estimates the ACL using relevant available information from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts that vary by loan portfolio. We use economic forecasts from Moody’s Analytics in this process. The economic forecast is updated monthly; therefore, the 
one
 used for each quarter-end calculation is generally based on a 
one
-month lag based on the timing of when the forecast is released. The Company does 
not
 consider a 
one
-month lag to create a material difference but considers any subsequent material changes to our estimated loss forecasts as deemed appropriate. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level, or term as well as for changes in environmental conditions, such as changes in gross domestic product (or “GDP”), unemployment rates, property values, or other relevant factors.

Under the CECL methodology, quantitative and qualitative loss factors are applied to our population of loans on a collective pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist. The Company evaluates loans for expected credit losses on an individual basis if, based on current information and events, the loan does 
not
 share similar credit risk characteristics with other loans. The Company 
 may 
choose to measure expected credit losses on an individual loan basis by using 
one
 of the following methods: (
1
) the present value of the expected future cash flows of the loan discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate, or (
2
) if the loan is collateral dependent, the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell. For loans that are 
not
 collateral-dependent, the Company uses the present value of future cash flows.

Under the Company’s CECL methodology, 
nine
 portfolio segments with similar risk characteristics are evaluated for expected loss. Six portfolios are modeled using econometric models and 
three
 smaller portfolios are evaluated using a simplified loss-rate method that calculates lifetime expected credit losses for the respective pools (simplified approach). The 
six
 portfolios subject to econometric modeling include residential mortgages; commercial and industrial loans (“C&I”); construction loans; commercial real estate (“CRE”) for multifamily loans; CRE for owner-occupied loans; and other CRE loans. We estimate the probability of default during the reasonable and supportable forecast period using separate econometric regression models developed to correlate macroeconomic variables, (GDP, unemployment, CRE prices and residential mortgage prices) to loan risk rating performance for each of the 
six
 loan portfolios from the 
fourth
 quarter of 
2007
 to the 
fourth
 quarter of 
2022.
 Loss given default rates are computed based on the net charge-offs recognized divided by the exposure at default of defaulted loans starting with the 
fourth
 quarter of 
2007
 through the 
fourth
 quarter of 
2022.
 The probability of default and the loss given default rates are applied to the expected amount at default at the loan level based on contractual scheduled payments and estimated prepayments. The amounts so calculated comprise the quantitative portion of the allowance for credit losses.

        NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)

The Company’s CECL methodology utilizes an 
eight
-quarter reasonable and supportable (“R&S”) forecast period, and a 
four
-quarter reversion period. Management relies on multiple forecasts, which are weighted in determining a single loss estimate. Generally speaking, the blended scenario approach would include the Baseline, the Alternative Scenario 
1
 – Upside – 
10th
 Percentile and the Alternative Scenario 
3
 – Downside – 
90th
 Percentile forecasts. After the R&S period, the Company reverts linearly for the 
four
-quarter reversion period to the long-term loss rates for each of the 
six
 portfolios of loans.

The Company’s CECL methodology estimates expected credit losses over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals, and modifications unless the extension or renewal options are included in the original or modified contract at the reporting date and are 
not
 unconditionally cancellable by the Company.

The simplified approach portfolios include Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loans, Home Equity Lines of Credit (“HELOCs”) and cash-secured loans, which are 
not
 modelled econometrically due to the low loss history for these 
three
 pools of loans. The forecasted loss rate is based on the forecasted GDP and unemployment rates during the 
first

eight
 quarters of the portfolio’s contractual life, reversion loss rates for the next 
four
 quarters of the portfolio’s contractual life on a linear declining rate, and the long-term loss rate projected over the remainder of the portfolio’s contractual life.

Under the Company’s CECL methodology, the qualitative portion of the reserve on pooled loans represents management’s judgment of additional considerations to account for internal and external risk factors that are 
not
 adequately measured in the quantitative reserve. The qualitative loss factors consider idiosyncratic risk factors, conditions that 
 may 
not
 be reflected in quantitatively derived results, or other relevant factors to seek to ensure the allowance for credit losses reflects our best estimate of current expected credit losses. The qualitative reserves include reserves for policy exceptions, experience of management and staff, level of competition in the lending environment, weak risk identification, lack of historical loss experience with residential mortgage loans made to non-U.S. residents, oil & gas, the higher risk characteristics of purchased syndicated loans, model uncertainty, and loans with potential risk of loss given the current environment, including CRE and Office loans, but have 
not
 degraded to the point of qualifying for a specific reserve.  Current and forecasted economic trends and underlying market values for collateral dependent loans also are considered within the econometric models described above.

The Company’s CECL methodology requires a significant amount of management judgment in determining the appropriate allowance for credit losses. Several of the steps in the methodology involve judgment and are subjective in nature including, among other things: segmenting the loan portfolio; determining the period over which loss history to consider; selecting predictive econometric regression models that use appropriate macroeconomic variables; determining the methodology to forecast prepayments; selecting the most appropriate economic forecast scenario; determining the length of the R&S forecast and reversion periods; estimating expected utilization rates on unfunded loan commitments; and assessing relevant and appropriate qualitative factors. In addition, the CECL methodology is dependent on economic forecasts that are inherently imprecise and will change from period to period. Although the allowance for credit losses is considered by management to be appropriate, there can be 
no
 assurance that it will be sufficient to absorb future losses.

Management believes the allowance for credit losses is appropriate for the current expected credit losses in our loan portfolio and associated unfunded commitments, and the risk ratings and inherent loss rates currently assigned are reasonable and appropriate as of the reporting date. It is possible that others, given the same information, 
 may 
at any point in time reach different conclusions that could result in a significant impact to the Company’s financial statements.

Individually Evaluated Loans
.  Loans that do 
not
 share similar risk characteristics with other financial assets are individually evaluated for impairment and excluded from loan pools used within the collective evaluation of estimated credit losses. We defined the following criteria for what constitutes a “default”, which results in a loan 
no
 longer sharing similar risk characteristics with other loans, and therefore requires an individual evaluation for expected credit losses. The criteria for default 
 may 
include any 
one
 of the following: on nonaccrual status, modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, or payment delinquency of 
90
 days or more.

The Company has adopted ASU 
2022
-
02,
 “Financial Instruments – Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures” effective 
 January 1, 2023. 
As part of the adoption, the Company has elected to apply the pending content prospectively and the practical expedient to exclude the accrued interest receivable balance from the disclosed amortized cost basis of loan modifications to debtors experiencing financial difficulty, consistent with our ACL approach discussed further below in this footnote.

Under the new guidance on loan modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, when a loan held for investment is modified and is considered to be a continuation of the original loan, the Company uses the post-modification contractual rate to derive the effective interest rate when using a discounted cash flow method to determine the allowance for credit loss.

The amendments in this new guidance eliminate the previous TDR recognition and measurement guidance and, instead, require that an entity evaluate whether the modification represents a new loan or a continuation of an existing loan.

Under the prior TDR guidance, a TDR is a formal modification of the terms of a loan when the lender, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower’s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower. The concessions 
 may 
be granted in various forms, including a change in the stated interest rate, a reduction in the loan balance or accrued interest, or an extension of the maturity date. Although these loan modifications were considered TDRs, TDR loans that had, pursuant to the Bank’s policy, performed under the restructured terms and had demonstrated sustained performance under the modified terms for 
six
 months were returned to accrual status. The sustained performance considered by management pursuant to its policy included the periods prior to the modification if the prior performance met or exceeded the modified terms. This would include cash paid by the borrower prior to the restructuring to set up interest reserves. Loans classified as TDRs were reported as individually evaluated loans.

The allowance for credit loss on a TDR was measured using the same method as all other loans held for investment, except when the value of a concession cannot be measured using a method other than the discounted cash flow method. Under the prior guidance when the value of a concession was measured using the discounted cash flow method, the allowance for credit loss was determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at the original interest rate of the loan.

        NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)

Unfunded Loan Commitments. 
Unfunded loan commitments are generally related to providing credit facilities to clients of the Bank and are 
not
 actively traded financial instruments. These unfunded commitments are disclosed as off-balance sheet financial instruments in Note 
13
 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company, using the same loss factors as used for the allowance for loan losses. The reserve for unfunded loan commitments uses the expected historical usage rate of the unfunded commitments during the contractual life of the commitments. The allowance for unfunded commitments is included in “other liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the allowance for unfunded commitments are included in the provision for loan losses.

Letter of Credit Fees
. Issuance and commitment fees received for the issuance of commercial or standby letters of credit are recognized over the term of the instruments.

Other Real Estate Owned (
“
OREO
”
).
 Real estate acquired in the settlement of loans is initially recorded at fair value, less estimated costs to sell. Specific valuation allowances on other real estate owned are recorded through charges to operations to recognize declines in fair value subsequent to foreclosure. Gain or loss on sale is recognized when certain criteria relating to the buyer’s initial and continuing investment in the property are met.

Investments in Affordable Housing Partnerships and Other Tax Credit Investments.
  The Company is a limited partner in limited partnerships that invest in low-income housing projects that are intended to qualify for Federal and/or State income tax credits and limited partnerships that invests in alternative energy systems that are intended to qualify for alternative energy tax credits.  As further discussed in Note 
5
 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the partnership interests are accounted for utilizing the equity method of accounting. As of 
 December 31, 2024
, 
eleven
 of the limited partnerships in which the Company has an equity interest were determined to be variable interest entities for which the Company is the primary beneficiary.  The Company therefore consolidated the financial statements of these 
eleven
 limited partnerships into the Consolidated Financial Statements.  The tax credits from these partnerships are recognized in the consolidated financial statements to the extent they are utilized on the Company’s income tax returns.  The investments are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurred that would trigger potential impairment.

Investments in Venture Capital.
 The Company invests in limited partnerships that invest in nonpublic companies. These are commonly referred to as venture capital investments. These limited partnership interests are carried under the cost method with impairment charged against net income.

Premises and Equipment. 
Premises and equipment are carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method based on the following estimated useful lives of the assets:

Type

Estimated Useful Life (years)

Buildings

15
 to 
45

Building improvements

5
 to 
20

Furniture, fixtures, and equipment

3
 to 
25

Leasehold improvements

Shorter of useful lives or the terms of the leases

Improvements are capitalized and amortized to occupancy expense based on the above table. Construction in process is carried at cost and includes land acquisition cost, architectural fees, general contractor fees, capitalized interest and other costs related directly to the construction of a property.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
  Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in an acquisition. Goodwill and other intangible assets are assessed for impairment annually as of 
 December 31 
or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount 
 may 
not
 be recoverable. The Company performed its annual impairment test and determined 
no
 impairment existed as of 
 December 31, 2024
, and 
2023
.

Other intangible assets.
 Other intangible assets are mainly comprised of core deposit intangible ("CDI"), which represents the purchase price over the fair value of the deposits acquired from other financial institutions. CDI is amortized over its estimated useful life to its residual value in proportion to the economic benefits consumed.  If a pattern of consumption cannot be reliably determined, straight-line amortization is used.  The Company assesses the recoverability of this intangible asset by determining whether the amortization of the premium balance over its remaining life can be recovered through the remaining deposit portfolio and amortizes core deposit premium over its estimated useful life.

Bank-Owned Life Insurance.
  We have purchased single premium life insurance policies (“bank-owned life insurance”) on certain officers. The Bank is the beneficiary under each policy. In the event of the death of a covered officer, we will receive the specified insurance benefit from the insurance carrier and pay a fixed dollar amount to the beneficiary designated by the officer. Bank-owned life insurance is recorded at the amount that can be realized under the insurance contract at the balance sheet date, which is the cash surrender value adjusted for other charges or other amounts due, if any, that are probable at settlement.

Stock-Based Compensation. 
 The Company grants time-based RSUs, which include service conditions for vesting. Compensation cost for these time-based awards is based on the quoted market price of the Company’s common stock at the grant date. Compensation costs for time-based RSUs that will be settled in cash instead of shares are adjusted to fair value based on changes in the Company’s stock price up to the settlement date. In addition, the Company grants performance-based RSUs, which contain additional performance goals and market conditions that are required to be met in order for the awards to vest. Compensation expense for these performance-based RSUs is based on the grant-date fair value considers both performance and market conditions. Subsequently, the Company evaluates the probable outcome of the performance conditions quarterly and makes cumulative adjustments for current and prior periods in compensation expense in the period of change. Market conditions subsequent to the grant date have 
no
 impact on the amount of compensation expense the Company will recognize over the life of the award. Compensation cost is amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award, which is generally the maximum vesting period of the award. Excess tax benefits and deficiencies on share-based payment awards are recognized within Income tax expense on the Consolidated Statement of Income. As stock-based compensation expense is estimated based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it is reduced by the expense related to awards expected to be forfeited. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and are updated quarterly. If the estimated forfeitures are revised, a cumulative effect of changes in estimated forfeitures for the current and prior periods is recognized in compensation expense in the period of change.

        NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)

Stock option compensation expense is calculated based on the fair value of the award at the grant date for those options expected to vest and is recognized as an expense over the vesting period of the grant using the straight-line method.  The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the value of granted options.  This model takes into account the option exercise price, the expected life, the current price of the underlying stock, the expected volatility of the Company’s stock, expected dividends on the stock and a risk-free interest rate.  The Company estimates the expected volatility based on the Company’s historical stock prices for the period corresponding to the expected life of the stock options. Restricted stock units are valued at the closing price of the Company’s stock on the date of the grant.

Derivatives
.  The Company follows ASC Topic 
815
 that establishes accounting and reporting standards for financial derivatives, including certain financial derivatives embedded in other contracts, and hedging activities. It requires the recognition of all financial derivatives as assets or liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.  The accounting treatment of changes in fair value is dependent upon whether or 
not
 a financial derivative is designated as a hedge and, if so, the type of hedge.  Fair value is determined using 
third
-party models with observable market data. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) and are reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction is reflected in earnings.  For derivatives designated as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are reflected in current earnings, together with changes in the fair value of the related hedged item if there is a highly effective correlation between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps and changes in the fair value of the underlying asset or liability that is intended to be hedged.  If there is 
not
 a highly effective correlation between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap and changes in the fair value of the underlying asset or liability that is intended to be hedged, then only the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Foreign Exchange Forwards and Foreign Currency Option Contracts.

We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts with correspondent banks to mitigate the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for foreign currency certificates of deposit, foreign exchange contracts or foreign currency option contracts entered into with our clients. These contracts are 
not
 designated as hedging instruments and are recorded at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of these contracts as well as the related foreign currency certificates of deposit, foreign exchange contracts or foreign currency option contracts, are recognized immediately in net income as a component of non-interest income. Period end gross positive fair values are recorded in other assets and gross negative fair values are recorded in other liabilities.

Income Taxes. 
The provision for income taxes is based on income reported for financial statement purposes, and differs from the amount of taxes currently payable, since certain income and expense items are reported for financial statement purposes in different periods than those for tax reporting purposes.  The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability approach, the objective of which is to establish deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company’s assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled.  A valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than 
not
 that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will 
not
 be realized.

Comprehensive Income/(loss). 
Comprehensive income/(loss) is defined as the change in equity during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources.  Comprehensive income/(loss) generally includes net income/(loss), unrealized gains and losses on investments in securities available-for-sale, and cash flow hedges.  Comprehensive income/(loss) and its components are reported and displayed in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.   

Net Income per Common Share
. Earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed on a basic and diluted basis. Basic EPS excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shares in the earnings of the Company. Potential dilution is excluded from computation of diluted per-share amounts when a net loss from operations exists.

Foreign Currency Translation.

The Company considers the functional currency of its foreign operations to be the United States dollar. Accordingly, the Company remeasures monetary assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates, while nonmonetary items are remeasured at historical rates. Income and expense accounts are remeasured at the average rates in effect during the year, except for depreciation, which is remeasured at historical rates.  Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recognized in income in the period of occurrence.

Statement of Cash Flows
.  Cash and cash equivalents include short-term highly liquid investments that generally have an original maturity of 
three
 months or less.

Segment Reporting.
  The Company operates as a single operating segment.  Our Chief Executive Officer is our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”).  The CODM uses net income to evaluate financial performance and allocate resources based on net income that also is reported on the income statement as consolidated net income and compares to budgeted amounts. The accounting policies of the operating segment are the same as those of our consolidated entity and described in the summary of significant accounting policies.  The measure of segment assets is reported on the balance sheet as total assets.   

The Company’s operations primarily consist of commercial banking services, servicing primarily the individuals, professionals, and small to medium-sized businesses in the local markets in which its branches are located.  Its operations include the acceptance of checking, savings, and time deposits, and the making of commercial, real estate, and consumer loans.  The Bank also offers trade financing, letters of credit, wire transfer, foreign currency spot and forward contracts, internet banking, investment services, and other customary banking services to its customers within the United States.  As such the Company does 
not
 report any disaggregated financial information.

The Company generates substantially all its revenues from banking services and does 
not
 have material operations outside the United States.

Allowance for Credit Losses

The AFS securities that were in an unrealized loss position as of 
 December 31, 2024
, were evaluated to determine whether the decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis resulted from a credit loss or other factors. For a discussion of the factors and criteria the Company uses in analyzing securities for impairment related to credit losses, see Note 
1
 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Allowance for Credit Losses on Available for Sale Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company concluded the unrealized losses were primarily attributed to yield curve movement, together with widened liquidity spreads and credit spreads. The issuers have 
not,
 to the Company’s knowledge, established any cause for default on these securities. The Company expects to recover the amortized cost basis of its securities and has 
no
 present intent to sell and will 
not
 be required to sell securities AFS that have declined below their cost before their anticipated recovery. Accordingly, 
no
 allowance for credit losses was recorded as of 
 December 31, 2024
, and 
2023
, against these securities, and there was 
no
 provision for credit losses recognized for the years ended 
 December 31, 2024
, 
2023
 and 
2022
.

 collateral-dependent non-accrual loans were secured by real estate and personal property.  The Bank generally seeks to obtain current appraisals, sales contracts, or other available market price information intended to provide updated factors in evaluating potential loss. The allowance for the collateral-dependent loans is calculated based on the difference between the outstanding loan balance and the value of the collateral as determined by recent appraisals, sales contracts, or other available market price information, less cost to sell. The allowance for collateral-dependent loans varies from loan to loan based on the collateral coverage of the loan at the time of designation as non-performing. We continue to monitor the collateral coverage of these loans, based on recent appraisals, on a quarterly basis and adjust the allowance accordingly.

        CATHAY GENERAL BANCORP AND SUBSIDIARIES

        NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)

The Company has adopted ASU 
2022
-
02,
 “Financial Instruments – Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures” effective 
 January 1, 2023.  
As part of the adoption, the Company has elected to apply the pending content prospectively and the practical expedient to exclude the accrued interest receivable balance from the disclosed amortized cost basis of loan modifications to debtors experiencing financial difficulty, consistent with our Allowance for Credit Losses ("ACL") approach discussed further below in this footnote.

Under this guidance on loan modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, when a loan held for investment is modified and is considered to be a continuation of the original loan, the Company uses the post-modification contractual rate to derive the effective interest rate when using a discounted cash flow method to determine the allowance for credit loss.

The amendments in this guidance require that an entity evaluate whether the modification represents a new loan or a continuation of an existing loans. 

Under the prior TDR guidance, a TDR is a formal modification of the terms of a loan when the lender, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower’s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower.  The concessions 
 may 
be granted in various forms, including a change in the stated interest rate, a reduction in the loan balance or accrued interest, or an extension of the maturity date. Although these loan modifications were considered TDRs, TDR loans that had, pursuant to the Bank’s policy, performed under the restructured terms and had demonstrated sustained performance under the modified terms for 
six
 months were returned to accrual status.  The sustained performance considered by management pursuant to its policy included the periods prior to the modification if the prior performance met or exceeded the modified terms.  This would include cash paid by the borrower prior to the restructuring to set up interest reserves.  Loans classified as TDRs were reported as individually evaluated loans.

The allowance for credit loss on a TDR was measured using the same method as all other loans held for investment, except when the value of a concession could 
not
 be measured using a method other than the discounted cash flow method. Under the prior guidance when the value of a concession was measured using the discounted cash flow method, the allowance for credit loss was determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at the original interest rate of the loan.

 The Company establishes a specific reserve for individually evaluated loans that do 
not
 share similar risk characteristics with the loans included in the collective reserve. These individually evaluated loans are removed from the pooling approach for the quantitative baseline, and include non-accrual loans, loan modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, and other loans as deemed appropriate by management.  The Company applies the loan refinancing and restructuring guidance provided in ASU 
2022
-
02
 to determine whether a modification made to a borrower results in a new loan or a continuation of an existing loan.  

 If economic conditions or other factors worsen relative to the assumptions the Company utilized, the expected loan losses will increase accordingly in future periods.

As of 
 December 31, 2022, 
under the prior TDR guidance, there was accruing TDRs of $
15.1
 million and non-accrual TDRs of $
6.3
 million.  As of 
 December 31, 2022, 
the Company allocated 
zero
 in reserves to accruing TDRs and $
427
 thousand to non-accrual TDRs. 

The following table presents TDRs that were modified during 
2022,
 their specific reserve as of 
 December 31, 2022,

The Company considers a loan to be in payment default once it is 
60
 to 
90
 days contractually past due under the modified terms. The Company tracks the performance of modified loans.  There were 
no
 loans that received a modification for the 
twelve
 months ended 
 December 31, 2024
, and 
2023
, that subsequently defaulted.

A modified loan 
 may 
become delinquent and 
 may 
result in a payment default (generally 
90
 days past due) subsequent to modification.  There were 
no
 loans that received modifications which subsequently defaulted for the 
twelve
 months ended 
 December 31, 2024
, and 
2023
.

  The Company closely monitors the performance of modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty to understand the effectiveness of its modification efforts. 

The following table presents the performance of loans that were modified during the 
twelve
 months ended 
 December 31, 2024
, and 
2023
.

Under the Company’s internal underwriting policy, an evaluation is performed of the probability that the borrower will be in payment default on any of its debt in the foreseeable future without the modification in order to determine whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty.

As of 
 December 31, 2024
, there were 
no
 commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty and whose loans were modified.

As part of the on-going monitoring of the credit quality of our loan portfolio, the Company utilizes a risk grading matrix to assign a risk rating to each loan.  Loans are risk rated based on analysis of the current state of the borrower’s credit quality.  The analysis of credit quality includes a review of sources of repayment, the borrower’s current financial and liquidity status and other relevant information. The risk rating categories can be generally described by the following grouping for non-homogeneous loans:

●

Pass/Watch 
–

These loans range from minimal credit risk to higher than average, but still acceptable, credit risk. The loans have sufficient sources of repayment to repay the loans in full, in accordance with all the terms and conditions and remains currently well protected by collateral values.

●

Special Mention
 – Borrower is fundamentally sound, and the loan is currently protected but adverse trends are apparent that, if 
not
 corrected, 
 may 
affect ability to repay.  Primary source of loan repayment remains viable but there is increasing reliance on collateral or guarantor support.

●

Substandard
 – These loans are inadequately protected by current sound worth, paying capacity or collateral.  Well-defined weaknesses exist that could jeopardize repayment of debt. Loss 
 may 
not
 be imminent, but if weaknesses are 
not
 corrected, there is a good possibility of some loss.  

●

Doubtful 
– The possibility of loss is extremely high, but due to identifiable and important pending events (which 
 may 
strengthen the loan), a loss classification is deferred until the situation is better defined.

●

Loss 
– These loans are considered uncollectible and of such little value that to continue to carry the loans as an active asset is 
no
 longer warranted.

Investments in Affordable Housing and Alternative Energy Partnerships 

The Company holds ownership interests in a number of limited partnerships that were formed to develop and operate housing for lower-income tenants throughout the United States and alternative energy partnerships that qualify for energy tax credits. The Company evaluates its interests in these partnerships to determine whether they meet the definition of a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”) and whether the Company is required to consolidate these entities. A VIE is consolidated by its primary beneficiary, which is the party that has both (i) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and (ii) a variable interest that could potentially be significant to the VIE. To determine whether or 
not
 a variable interest the Company holds could potentially be significant to the VIE, the Company considers both qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the nature, size and form of the Company's involvement with the VIE. While the Company has determined that its interests in these entities meet the definition of a variable interest in accordance with ASC 
810,
 the Company has determined that the Company is 
not
 the primary beneficiary in all but 
eleven
 of these partnerships because the Company does 
not
 have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the entities including operational and credit risk management activities.  As the Company is 
not
 the primary beneficiary, the Company did 
not
 consolidate the entities.

The investment in these entities approximates the maximum exposure to loss as a result of the Company’s involvement with these unconsolidated entities. The balance of the Company’s investments in these entities was $
289.6
 million and $
315.7
 million as of 
 December 31, 2024
, and 
2023
, respectively.

The Company’s investments in these partnerships, net, are presented in the table below:

The consolidation of these limited partnerships in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements increased total assets and liabilities by $
26.0
 million as of 
 December 31, 2024
, and by $
25.3

Each of the partnerships must meet regulatory requirements for affordable housing and alternative energy projects, including long-term minimum compliance periods (such as a 
15
-year minimum compliance period for certain affordable housing tax credits) to fully utilize the tax credits. If the partnerships cease to qualify during the compliance period, the credits 
 may 
be denied for any period in which the projects are 
not
 in compliance and a portion of the credits previously taken is subject to recapture with interest. The remaining tax credits to be utilized over a multiple-year period are $
252.4
 million for Federal and $
5.1
 million for State as of 
 December 31, 2024
. The possible inability to realize these tax credits and other returns from our investments in these partnerships can have a negative impact on our financial results. The risk of 
not
 being able to realize the tax credits and other returns depends on many factors, including changes in the applicable provisions of the tax code, the ability of the projects to be completed and properly managed and other factors that are outside of our control.  Losses in excess of the Bank’s investment in 
three
 limited partnerships have 
not
 been recorded in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements because the Company had fully satisfied all capital commitments required under the respective limited partnership agreements. In 
2024
 and 
2023
, non-interest expense included $
6.1
 million and $
7.7
 million in impairment charges for investments in low-income housing partnerships.

Other Liabilities.

On 
 November 23, 2004, 
the Company entered into an agreement with Mr. Dunson K. Cheng, pursuant to which he agreed to defer any bonus amounts in excess of $
225
 thousand for the year ended 
 December 31, 2005, 
until the later of 
 January 1 
of the 
first
 year following his separation from service from the Company or the 
first
 day of the 
seventh
 month following his separation from service from the Company. Accordingly, an amount equal to $
610
 thousand was deferred in 
2004
 and was accrued in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The Company agreed to accrue interest on the deferred portion of the bonus at 
7.0
% per annum compounded quarterly.  The deferred amount will be increased each quarter by the amount of interest computed for that quarter.  On 
 November 23, 2014, 
the interest rate was reset to 
5.06
% based on 
275
 basis points above the interest rate on the 
ten
-year Treasury Note on that date. On 
 March 13, 2014, 
the Compensation Committee of the Company awarded Mr. Cheng a cash bonus in the amount of $
300
 thousand for the quarter ended 
 December 31, 2013 
and provided as part of the award that payment of the bonus would be deferred until the later of 
 January 1 
of the 
first
 year following his separation from service from the Company or the 
first
 day of the 
seventh
 month following his separation from service from the Company. The Company accrues interest on the deferred bonus at 
5.02
% per annum compounded quarterly. On 
 March 28, 2019, 
the interest rate was reset to 
5.72
% based on 
350
 basis points above the interest rate on the 
five
-year Treasury Note on that date.

The balance of deferred bonuses was $
2.6
 million and $
2.4
 million at 
 December 31, 2024
, and 
2023
, respectively. Accrued interest of deferred bonuses were $
129
 thousand during 
2024
, $
122
 thousand during 
2023
, and $
116
 thousand during 
2022
.    

We established 
three
 special purpose trusts in 
2003
 and 
two
 in 
2007
 for the purpose of issuing Guaranteed Preferred Beneficial Interests in their Subordinated Debentures to outside investors (“Capital Securities”). The proceeds from the issuance of the Capital Securities as well as our purchase of the common stock of the special purpose trusts were invested in Junior Subordinated Notes of the Company (“Junior Subordinated Notes”). The trusts exist for the purpose of issuing the Capital Securities and investing in Junior Subordinated Notes.  Subject to some limitations, payment of distributions out of the monies held by the trusts and payments on liquidation of the trusts, or the redemption of the Capital Securities, are guaranteed by the Company to the extent the trusts have funds on hand at such time. The obligations of the Company under the guarantees and the Junior Subordinated Notes are subordinate and junior in right of payment to all indebtedness of the Company and will be structurally subordinated to all liabilities and obligations of the Company’s subsidiaries. The Company has the right to defer payments of interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes at any time or from time to time for a period of up to 
twenty
 consecutive quarterly periods with respect to each deferral period. Under the terms of the Junior Subordinated Notes, the Company 
 may 
not,
 with certain exceptions, declare or pay any dividends or distributions on its capital stock or purchase or acquire any of its capital stock if it has deferred payment of interest on any Junior Subordinated Notes.

As of 
 December 31, 2024
, and 
2023
, Junior Subordinated Notes totaled $
119.1
 million, with a weighted average interest rate of 
7.75
% and 
7.54
%, respectively.  The Junior Subordinated Notes have a stated maturity term of 
30
 years. Interest expense on the Junior Subordinated Notes was $
8.1
 million, $
6.5
 million, and $
5.5
 million for years ended 
 December 31, 2024
, 
2023
 and 
2022
, respectively. Included in the 
2022
 and 
2023
 interest expense is the amortization of the gain on cash flow interest rate swaps, early terminated in 
2022.

Capital Resources 

Total equity was $

, an increase of $
109.1
 million, or 
4.0
%, from $
2.74
 billion at 
 December 31, 
2023
, primarily due to net income of $
286.0
 million, stock based compensation of $
6.0
 million, proceeds from dividend reinvestment of $
2.9
 million, and stock issued to directors of $
0.9

98.0
 million, purchases of treasury stock of $
84.7
 million, shares withheld related to net share settlement of RSU’s of $
3.7
 million, and other comprehensive loss of $
0.2

1.36
 per common share in 
2024
, $
1.36
 per common share in 
2023
, and $
1.36
 per common share in 
2022
.

On 
 May 
28th,

2024,
 the Company announced a new stock repurchase program to buy back up to $
125.0
 million of the Company's common stock.  The previous $
125.0
 million share repurchase program announced on 
 May 26, 2022, 
was completed on 
 February 21, 2023, 
with the repurchase of 
2,897,628
 shares at an average cost of $
43.14
. Through 
 December 31, 2024
, the Company repurchased 
2,028,581
 shares of common stock for a total of $
83.9
 million, at an average cost of $
41.37
 per share under the 
 May 2024 
buyback program.

The 
five
 special purpose trusts established for the purpose of issuing the Capital Securities are considered variable interest entities.  Because the Bancorp is 
not
 the primary beneficiary of the trusts, the financial statements of the trusts are 
not
 included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company. The Junior Subordinated Notes, all of which were issued before 
 May 19, 2010, 
are currently included in the Tier 
2
 capital of the Bancorp for regulatory capital purposes.  Under the Dodd-Frank Act, trust preferred securities issued before 
 May 19, 2010, 
by bank holding companies with assets of less than 
$15.0
 billion as of 
 December 31, 2009, 
continue to qualify for Tier 
1
 capital treatment. As of 
 December 31, 2024
, and 
2023
, the Company’s assets exceeded the 
$15.0
 billion threshold and, as a result, the Junior Subordinated Notes 
no
 longer qualify as Tier 
1
 capital for regulatory reporting purposes.

Amounts for the current year are based upon estimates and assumptions and could vary from amounts shown on the tax returns as filed.

At 
 December 31, 2024
, the Company has California NOL carryovers of $
33.5
 million for which a California deferred tax asset of $
3.2
 million has been recorded reflecting the expected benefit of these California NOL carryovers.  The annual IRC Section 
382
 limitation is 
$7.3
 million per year. If 
not
 utilized, a portion of the Company’s state NOL’s will begin to expire in 
2030.
 At 
 December 31, 2024
, the Company’s federal tax credit carryovers total $
28.7
 million .  If 
not
 utilized, the federal tax credit carryovers will begin to expire in 
2028.
  The AMT tax credit carryovers can be carried forward indefinitely.

In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than 
not
 that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will 
not
 be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than 
not
 the Company will realize all benefits related to these deductible temporary differences.

 Equity and Earnings per Share

As a bank holding company, the Bancorp’s ability to pay dividends will depend upon the dividends it receives from the Bank and on the income it 
 may 
generate from any other activities in which it 
 may 
engage, either directly or through other subsidiaries. 

Under California banking law, the Bank 
 may 
not,
 without regulatory approval, pay a cash dividend that exceeds the lesser of the Bank’s retained earnings or its net income for the last 
three
 fiscal years, less any cash distributions made during that period.  Under this regulation, the amount of retained earnings available for cash dividends to the Company immediately after 
 December 31, 2024
, is restricted to approximately $
433.6
 million. The amount of retained earnings available for cash dividends is restricted to approximately $
420.4
 million for 
 December 31,
2023
.

Commitments and Contingencies

Legal Proceedings.

The Company is involved in various claims and legal proceedings that arise in the course of conducting the Company’s business. The outcome of such claims and legal proceedings are inherently difficult to predict. Management, after consultation with legal counsel and based upon its assessment of information currently available to the Company, believes that any liability resulting from the resolution of any claims and proceedings currently pending against the Company will 
not
 have a material effect upon the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity taken as a whole. 

In accordance with ASC 
450,
 “Contingencies,” the Company accrues reserves for outstanding lawsuits, claims and proceedings when a loss contingency is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company estimates the amount of loss contingencies using current available information from legal proceedings, advice from legal counsel, and available insurance coverage. Due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcomes of the legal proceedings, any amounts accrued or included in this aggregate amount 
 may 
not
 represent the ultimate loss to the Company from the legal proceedings in question. Thus, the Company’s exposure and ultimate losses 
 may 
be higher, and possibly significantly more than the amounts accrued.

Lending
.  In the normal course of business, the Company becomes a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk to meet the financing needs of its clients. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit in the form of loans or through commercial or standby letters of credit and financial guarantees. Those instruments represent varying degrees of exposure to risk in excess of the amounts included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The contractual or notional amount of these instruments indicates a level of activity associated with a particular class of financial instrument and is 
not
 a reflection of the level of expected losses, if any.

The Company’s exposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments.  The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. Unless noted otherwise, the Company does 
not
 require collateral or other security to support financial instruments with credit risk.

Financial instruments for which contract amounts represent the amount of credit risk include the following:

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a client provided there is 
no
 violation of any condition established in the commitment agreement. These commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and are expected to expire without being drawn upon. The total commitment amounts do 
not
 necessarily represent future cash requirements.  The Company evaluates each client’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit is based on management’s credit evaluation of the borrowers.

As of 
 December 31, 2024
, the Company does 
not
 have fixed-rate or variable-rate commitments with characteristics similar to options, which provide the holder, for a premium paid at inception to the Company, the benefits of favorable movements in the price of an underlying asset or index with limited or 
no
 exposure to losses from unfavorable price movements. 

As of 
 December 31, 2024
, commitments to extend credit of $
3.47
 billion include commitments to fund fixed rate loans of $
63.4
 million and adjustable-rate loans of $
3.41
 billion. As of 
 December 31, 
2023
, commitments to extend credit of $
3.81
 billion and included commitments to fund fixed rate loans of $
130.3
 million and adjustable-rate loans of $
3.69
 billion.

Commercial letters of credit and bill of lading guarantees are issued to facilitate domestic and foreign trade transactions while standby letters of credit are issued to make payments on behalf of clients if certain specified future events occur.  The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit and bill of lading guarantees is essentially the same as that involved in making loans to clients.

Leases

The Company enters into operating leases in the normal course of business primarily for branch offices, office spaces and certain equipment. The Company 
 may 
seek to include options to extend or terminate a lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise those options.

ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated present value of the lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of its lease liabilities. The Company has elected to 
not
 separate lease and non-lease components. The Company has also elected 
not
 to recognize a ROU asset and lease liability for leases with original lease term of 
12
 months or less (short-term leases). The Company does 
not
 possess any leases that have variable lease payments or residual value guarantees as of 
 December 31, 2024
, and 
2023
.

The following table represents the operating lease amounts reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and other supplemental information as of

Financial Derivatives

The Company does 
not
 speculate on the future direction of interest rates. As part of the Company’s asset and liability management, however, the Company enters into financial derivatives to seek to mitigate exposure to interest rate risks related to its interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.  The Company believes that these transactions, when properly structured and managed, 
 may 
provide a hedge against inherent interest rate risk in our assets or liabilities and against risk in specific transactions. In such instances, the Company 
 may 
protect its position through the purchase or sale of interest rate future contracts for a specific cash or interest rate risk position.  Other hedging transactions 
 may 
be implemented using interest rate swaps, interest rate caps, floors, financial futures, forward rate agreements, and options on futures or bonds. Prior to considering any hedging activities, the Company seeks to analyze the costs and benefits of the hedge in comparison to other viable alternative strategies. All hedges will require an assessment of basis risk and must be approved by the Bancorp or the Bank’s Investment Committee.

Table of Contents

        CATHAY GENERAL BANCORP AND SUBSIDIARIES

        NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)

The Company follows ASC Topic 
815
 that establishes accounting and reporting standards for financial derivatives, including certain financial derivatives embedded in other contracts, and hedging activities. It requires the recognition of all financial derivatives as assets or liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and measurement of those financial derivatives at fair value.  The accounting treatment of changes in fair value is dependent upon whether or 
not
 a financial derivative is designated as a hedge and, if so, the type of hedge. Fair value is determined using 
third
-party models with observable market data. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income and are reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction is reflected in earnings.  For derivatives designated as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are reflected in current earnings, together with changes in the fair value of the related hedged item if there is a highly effective correlation between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps and changes in the fair value of the underlying asset or liability that is intended to be hedged. If there is 
not
 a highly effective correlation between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap and changes in the fair value of the underlying asset or liability that is intended to be hedged, then only the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

The Company offers various interest rate derivative contracts to its clients. When derivative transactions are executed with its clients, the derivative contracts are offset by paired trades with 
third
-party financial institutions including with central counterparties (“CCP”). Certain derivative contracts entered with CCPs are settled-to-market daily to the extent the CCP’s rulebooks legally characterize the variation margin as settlement. Derivative contracts are intended to allow borrowers to lock in attractive intermediate and long-term fixed rate financing while 
not
 increasing the interest rate risk to the Company. These transactions are generally 
not
 linked to specific Company assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets or to forecasted transactions in a hedging relationship and, therefore, are economic hedges. The contracts are marked to market at each reporting period. The changes in fair values of the derivative contracts traded with 
third
-party financial institutions are expected to be largely comparable to the changes in fair values of the derivative transactions executed with clients throughout the terms of these contracts, except for the credit valuation adjustment component.  The Company records credit valuation adjustments on derivatives to properly reflect the variances of credit worthiness between the Company and the counterparties, considering the effects of enforceable master netting agreements and collateral arrangements. As of 
 December 31, 2024
, and 
2023
, the Company had outstanding interest rate derivative contracts with certain clients and 
third
-party financial institutions with a notional amount of $
680.5
 million and $
650.9
 million, respectively, with a fair value of $
32.7
 million and $
38.6
 million, respectively, for both clients and 
third
-party financial institutions.  As of 
 December 31, 2024
, and 
2023
, for borrower swap transactions, there were 
no
 notional amount of interest rate swaps cleared through the CCP.

In 
 May 2014, 
Bancorp entered into interest rate swap contracts in the notional amount of $
119.1
 million for a period of 
ten
 years.  The objective of these interest rate swap contracts, which were designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedges, was to hedge the quarterly interest payments on Bancorp’s $
119.1
 million of Junior Subordinated Debentures that had been issued to 
five
 trusts, throughout the 
ten
-year period beginning in 
 June 2014 
and ending in 
 June 2024, 
from the risk of variability of these payments resulting from changes in the 
three
-month LIBOR interest rate. The Company early terminated these cash flow derivative swaps in 
2022
 and realized a gain of $
4.0
 million for the year ended 
 December 31, 2022, 
and is recognizing the amount as a reduction of long-term debt interest expense over the remaining life of the swaps on a straight-line basis ending in 
 June 2024. 

As of 
 December 31, 2024
, and 
2023
, the Bank’s outstanding fair value interest rate swap contracts matched to individual fixed-rate commercial real estate loans had a notional amount of $
81.3
 million and $
88.5
 million with a fair value of $
3.3
 million and $
4.2
 million, respectively, and for various terms from 
three
 to 
ten
 years.   These contracts have been designated as hedging instruments to hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of the underlying commercial real estate loans due to changes in interest rates. The swap contracts are structured so that the notional amounts reduce over time to match the contractual amortization of the underlying loan and allow prepayments with the same pre-payment penalty amounts as the related loan.  As of 
 December 31, 2024
, and 
2023
, the ineffective portion of these interest rate swaps was 
not
 significant.

The Company has designated as a partial-term hedging election $
793.8
 million and $
1.07
 billion notional with a fair value of $
321
 thousand and $
3.8
 million as last-of-layer hedge on pools of loans with a notational value of $
1.32
 billion and $
1.78
 billion as of 
 December 31, 2024
, and 
2023
, respectively.  The loans are 
not
 expected to be affected by prepayment, defaults, or other factors affecting the timing and amount of cash flows under the last-of-layer method. The Company has entered into these pay-fixed and receive 
1
-Month Term SOFR interest rate swaps to convert the last-of-layer $
793.8
 million portion of a $
1.32
 billion fixed rate loan pools in order to reduce the Company’s exposure to higher interest rates for the last-of-layer tranches. As of 
 December 31, 2024
, and 
2023
, the last-of-layer loan tranche had a net fair value basis adjustment of $
1.2
 million and $
2.0
 million, respectively.  The interest rate swap converts this last-of-layer tranche into a floating rate instrument. The Company’s risk management objective with respect to this last-of-layer interest rate swap is to reduce interest rate exposure as to the last-of-layer tranche.

Interest rate swap contracts involve the risk of dealing with institutional derivative counterparties and their ability to meet contractual terms. Institutional counterparties must have a strong credit profile and be approved by the Company’s Board of Directors. The Company’s credit exposure on interest rate swaps is limited to the net favorable value and interest payments of all swaps by each counterparty. Credit exposure 
 may 
be reduced by the amount of collateral pledged by the counterparty.  Bancorp’s interest rate swaps have been assigned by the counterparties to a derivative clearing organization and daily margin is indirectly maintained with the derivative clearing organization.

The notional amount and net unrealized loss of the Company’s fair value hedge derivative financial instruments as of

Fair Value Measurements and Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Company uses fair value to measure certain assets and liabilities on a recurring basis, primarily securities available for-sale and derivatives. For assets measured at the lower of cost or fair value, the fair value measurement criteria 
 may 
or 
 may 
not
 be met during a reporting period and such measurements are therefore considered “nonrecurring” for purposes of disclosing our fair value measurements. Fair value is used on a nonrecurring basis to adjust carrying values for individually evaluated loans and other real estate owned and also to record impairment on certain assets, such as goodwill, CDI, and other long-lived assets.

The Company used valuation methodologies to measure assets at fair value under ASC Topic 
820
 and ASC Topic 
825,
 as amended by ASU 
2016
-
01
 and ASU 
2018
-
03,
 to estimate the fair value of financial instruments 
not
 recorded at fair value. The fair value of the Company’s assets and liabilities is classified and disclosed in 
one
 of the following 
three
 categories:

●

Level 
1
 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

●

Level 
2
 – Observable prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities; prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are 
not
 active; directly observable market inputs for substantially the full term of the asset and liability; market inputs that are 
not
 directly observable but are derived from or corroborated by observable market data.

●

Level 
3
 – Unobservable inputs based on the Company’s own judgment about the assumptions that a market participant would use.

The classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether inputs to the valuation methodology used are observable or unobservable, and the significance of those inputs in the fair value measurement. The Company’s assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to their fair value measurements.

Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis

The Company uses the following methodologies to measure the fair value of its financial assets and liabilities on a recurring basis:

Securities Available for Sale and Equity Securities
. For certain actively traded agency preferred stocks, mutual funds, U.S. Treasury securities, and other equity securities, the Company measures the fair value based on quoted market prices in active exchange markets at the reporting date, a Level 
1
 measurement.  The Company also measures securities by using quoted market prices for similar securities or dealer quotes, a Level 
2
 measurement.  This category generally includes U.S. Government agency securities, U.S. Government sponsored entities, state and municipal securities, mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”), collateralized mortgage obligations and corporate bonds.  

Warrants
. The Company measures the fair value of warrants based on unobservable inputs based on assumptions and management judgment, a Level 
3
 measurement.

Financial assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair value on a non-recurring basis.

Certain assets or liabilities are required to be measured at estimated fair value on a nonrecurring basis subsequent to initial recognition. Generally, these adjustments are the result of lower-of-cost-or-fair value or other impairment write-downs of individual assets. In determining the estimated fair values during the period, the Company determined that substantially all the changes in estimated fair value were due to declines in market conditions versus instrument specific credit risk. For the periods ended 
 December 31, 2024
, and 
 December 31, 
2023
, there were 
no
 material adjustments to fair value for the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with GAAP.

During the 
second
 quarter of 
2024,
 the Company entered into a restructuring support agreement and received equity securities in a private company, a Level 
3
 measurement.  The fair value of the Company’s Level 
3
 equity securities were measured using the private company’s projected earnings plus cash on hand. The primary inputs and assumptions used in the fair value measurement was derived from the issuer’s projected earnings and collateral, which included cash on hand, the financial standing of the issuer, the business and financial plan of the issuer, among other factors. Significant increases or decreases in any of the inputs or assumptions could result in a significant increase or decrease in the fair value measurement.

For financial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis that were still reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of 
 December 31, 2024
, and 
2023
, the following tables set forth the level of valuation assumptions used to determine each adjustment, the carrying value of the related individual assets at 
 December 31, 2024
, and

 Other real estate owned balance of $
19.4
 million in the Consolidated Balance Sheets is net of estimated disposal costs. 

The significant unobservable (Level 
3
) inputs used in the fair value measurement of collateral for collateral-dependent individually evaluated loans are primarily based on the appraised value of collateral adjusted by estimated sales cost and commissions.  The Company generally obtains new appraisal reports every 
twelve
 months as appropriate.  As the Company’s primary objective in the event of default would be to monetize the collateral to settle the outstanding balance of the loan, less marketable collateral would receive a larger discount. In the current year, the Company used borrower specific collateral discounts with various discount levels.

The fair value of individually evaluated loans is calculated based on the net realizable fair value of the collateral or the observable market price of the most recent sale or quoted price from loans held for sale. The Company does 
not
 record loans at fair value on a recurring basis. Nonrecurring fair value adjustments to collateral dependent individually evaluated loans are recorded based on the current appraised value of the collateral, a Level 
2
 measurement, or management’s judgment and estimation of value using discounted future cash flows or old appraisals which are then adjusted based on recent market trends, a Level 
3
 measurement.

        CATHAY GENERAL BANCORP AND SUBSIDIARIES

        NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)

Loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value upon transfer. Loans held for sale 
 may 
be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when fair value is less than cost. Fair value is generally determined based on available market data for similar loans and therefore, are classified as Level 
2
 measurement.

The significant unobservable inputs (Level 
3
) used in the fair value measurement of other real estate owned (“OREO”) are primarily based on the appraised value of OREO adjusted by estimated sales cost and commissions. The Company applies estimated sales cost and commissions ranging from 
3
% to 
6
% of the collateral value of individually evaluated loans, quoted price, or loan sale price of loans held for sale, and appraised value of OREO.

Fair value is estimated in accordance with ASC Topic 
825.
  Fair value estimates are made at specific points in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument.  These estimates do 
not
 reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at 
one
 time the Bank’s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument.    Because 
no
 market exists for a significant portion of the Bank’s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors.  These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.

The major revenue streams by fee type that are within the scope of ASC 
606
 presented in the above tables are described in additional detail below:

Fees and Services Charges on Deposit Accounts

Fees and service charges on deposit accounts include charges for analysis, overdraft, cash checking, ATM, and safe deposit activities executed by our deposit clients, as well as interchange income earned through card payment networks for the acceptance of card-based transactions. Fees earned from our deposit clients are governed by contracts that provide for overall custody and access to deposited funds and other related services and can be terminated at will by either party. Fees received from deposit clients for the various deposit activities are recognized as revenue once the performance obligations are met.  

Wealth Management Fees

The Company employs financial consultants to provide investment planning services for clients including wealth management services, asset allocation strategies, portfolio analysis and monitoring, investment strategies, and risk management strategies. The fees the Company earns are variable and are generally received monthly. The Company recognizes revenue for the services performed at quarter end based on actual transaction details received from the broker dealer the Company engages.

Practical Expedients and Exemptions

The Company applies the practical expedient in ASC 
606
-
10
-
50
-
14
 and does 
not
 disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations as the Company’s contracts with clients generally have a term that is less than 
one
 year, are open-ended with a cancellation period that is less than 
one
 year or allow the Company to recognize revenue in the amount to which the Company has the right to invoice.

In addition, given the short-term nature of the Company’s contracts, the Company also applies the practical expedient in ASC 
606
-
10
-
32
-
18
 and does 
not
 adjust the consideration from clients for the effects of a significant financing component, if at contract inception, the period between when the entity transfers the goods or services and when the client pays for that good or service is 
one
 year or less.

Employee Benefit Plans

Employee Stock Ownership Plan. 
Under the Company’s Amended and Restated Cathay Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”), the Company can make annual contributions to a trust in the form of either cash or common stock of the Bancorp for the benefit of eligible employees.  Employees are eligible to participate in the ESOP after completing 
two
 years of service for salaried full-time employees or 
1,000
 hours for each of 
two
 consecutive years for salaried part-time employees. The amount of the annual contribution is discretionary except that it must be sufficient to enable the trust to meet its current obligations.  The Company also pays for the administration of this plan and of the trust.  The Company has 
not
 made contributions to the trust since 
2004
 and does 
not
 expect to make any contributions in the future.  Effective 
 June 17, 2004, 
the ESOP was amended to provide the participants the election either to reinvest the dividends on the Company stock allocated to their accounts or to have these dividends distributed to the participant. The ESOP trust purchased 
21,218
 shares in 
2024
, 
16,555
 shares in 
2023
, and 
18,808

2022
, of the Bancorp’s common stock at an aggregate cost of $
867
 thousand in 
2024
, $
613
 thousand in 
2023
, and $
814
 thousand in 
2022
.  The distribution of benefits to participants totaled 
25,697
 shares in 
2024
, 
33,554
 shares in 
2023
, and 
29,363
 shares in 
2022
.  As of 
 December 31, 2024
, the ESOP owned 
642,745
 shares, or 
0.91
%, of the Company’s outstanding common stock.

401
(k) Plan.

In 
1997,
 the Board approved the Company’s 
401
(k) Profit Sharing Plan, which began on 
 March 
1,

1997.
 Salaried employees who have completed 
one
 month of service and have attained the age of 
21
 are eligible to participate.  Enrollment dates are on the 
first
 of each month. Participants 
 may 
contribute up to 
75
% of their eligible compensation for the year but 
not
 to exceed the dollar limit set by the Internal Revenue Code. Participants 
 may 
change their contribution election on the enrollment dates. Effective 
 October 1, 2022, 
the vesting schedule for the matching contribution is 
0
% for less than 
three
 years of service and 
100
% after 
three
 years of service.  Effective on 
 June 1, 2018, 
the Company matches 
100
% on the 
first

5.0
% of eligible compensation contributed per pay period by the participant, on the 
first
 day of the following month after 
30
 days of service. The Company’s contribution amounted to $
4.3
 million in 
2024
, $
4.5
 million in 
2023
, and $
3.9
 million in 
2022
. The Plan allows participants to withdraw all or part of their vested amount in the Plan due to certain financial hardship as set forth in the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury Regulations.  Participants 
 may 
also borrow up to 
50
% of the vested amount, with a maximum of $
50
 thousand.  The minimum loan amount is $
1
 thousand. 

Bank-Owned Life Insurance. 
As of 
 December 31, 2024
, and 
2023
, cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance was $
52.1
 million and $
50.9
 million, respectively. The Bank is the beneficiary under the policy. In the event of the death of a covered officer, we will receive the specified insurance benefit from the insurance carrier and pay a fixed dollar amount to the beneficiary designated by the officer.

Equity Incentive Plans

Pursuant to the Company’s 
2005
 Incentive Plan, as amended and restated in 
 May 2015, 
the Company 
 may 
grant incentive stock options (employees only), non-statutory stock options, common stock awards, restricted stock, RSUs, stock appreciation rights and cash awards to non-employee directors and eligible employees.

As of 
 December 31, 2024
, 
1,240,607
 shares were available under the 
2005
 Incentive Plan for future grants.

In addition to stock options, the Company also grants restricted stock units (“RSUs”) that are generally granted at 
no
 cost to the recipient. RSUs generally vest ratably over 
three
 years or cliff vest after 
one
 or 
three
 years of continued employment from the date of the grant. While a portion of RSUs 
 may 
be time-vesting awards, others 
 may 
vest subject to the attainment of specified performance goals and are referred to as “performance-based RSUs.” All RSUs are subject to forfeiture until vested.

Performance-based RSUs are granted at the target amount of awards. Based on the Company’s attainment of specified performance goals and consideration of market conditions, the number of shares that vest can be adjusted to a minimum of 
zero
 and to a maximum of 
150
% of the target. The amount of performance-based RSUs that are eligible to vest is determined at the end of each performance period and is then added together to determine the total number of performance shares that are eligible to vest. Performance-based RSUs generally cliff vest 
three
 years from the date of grant.

Compensation costs for the time-based awards are based on the quoted market price of the Company’s stock at the grant date. Compensation costs associated with performance-based RSUs are based on grant date fair value, which considers both market and performance conditions. Compensation costs of both time-based and performance-based awards are recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date until the vesting date of each grant.

Regulatory Matters

The Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Bank’s financial statements.  Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Bank’s assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.  The Bank’s capital amounts, and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has established 
five
 capital ratio categories: “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” and “critically undercapitalized.” A well-capitalized institution must have a common equity tier 
1
 capital ratio equal to or greater than 
6.5
%, a Tier 
1
 risk-based capital ratio equal to or greater than 
8
%, a total risk-based capital ratio equal to or greater than 
10
%, and a Tier 
1
 leverage capital ratio equal to or greater than 
5
%.  As of 
 December 31, 2024
, and 
2023
, the Bank qualified as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.

Balance Sheet Offsetting

Certain financial instruments, including resell and repurchase agreements, securities lending arrangements and derivatives, 
 may 
be eligible for offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and/or subject to master netting arrangements or similar agreements. The Company’s securities sold with agreements to repurchase and derivative transactions with upstream financial institution counter parties are generally executed under International Swaps and Derivative Association master agreements which include “right of set-off” provisions. In such cases, there is generally a legally enforceable right to offset recognized amounts and there 
 may 
be an intention to settle such amounts on a net basis.  Nonetheless, the Company does 
not
 generally offset such financial instruments for financial reporting purposes.

Financial instruments that are eligible for offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, as of 
 December 31, 2024
, and 
 December 31, 
2023
, are presented in the following tables:
