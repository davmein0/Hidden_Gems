Overview
We are a technology company with a mission to advance the state-of-the-art of EV technology for the benefits of all. We are setting new standards with the world’s most advanced EVs, the award-winning Lucid Air and all-new Lucid Gravity. Our focus on in-house hardware and software innovation, vertical integration, and a “clean sheet” approach to engineering and design led to the development of the award-winning Lucid Air and Lucid Gravity.
We sell vehicles directly to consumers through our retail sales network and through direct online sales, including utilizing Lucid Financial Services. We believe that owning and operating our sales network provides an opportunity to closely manage the customer experience, gather direct customer feedback, and ensure that customer interactions are tailored to our customers’ needs. We own and operate a vehicle service network comprised of service centers in major metropolitan areas and a fleet of mobile service vehicles. In addition to our in-house service capabilities, we established and continue to grow an approved list of specially trained collision repair shops which also serve in some cases as repair hubs for our mobile service offerings. 
We began delivering the Lucid Air to customers in October 2021. We have leveraged and expanded the technological advancements from the Lucid Air to the Lucid Gravity, which offers an unprecedented combination of performance, interior space, and efficiency, and started commercial production in December 2024. Beyond the Lucid Air and the Lucid Gravity, we plan to expand our vehicle lineup with the upcoming Midsize platform, which is scheduled for start of production in late 2026.
Recent Developments
2024 Underwriting Agreement
On October 16, 2024, we entered into an underwriting agreement (the “2024 Underwriting Agreement”) with BofA Securities, Inc. (the “Underwriter”), under which the Underwriter agreed to purchase 262,446,931 shares of our common stock. We also granted the Underwriter an Overallotment Option to purchase additional shares of our common stock (the “Overallotment Option”). On October 17, 2024, the Underwriter exercised the Overallotment Option to purchase an additional 15,037,594 shares. On October 18, 2024, we completed the public offering pursuant to the 2024 Underwriting Agreement, at a price per share of $2.59, for aggregate net proceeds of $718.4 million after deducting issuance costs of $0.6 million. 
2024 Subscription Agreement
On October 16, 2024, we also entered into a subscription agreement (the “2024 Subscription Agreement”) with Ayar Third Investment Company, our controlling stockholder (“Ayar”), pursuant to which Ayar agreed to purchase from us 374,717,927 shares of our common stock in a private placement. In addition, given the Underwriter’s exercise of the Overallotment Option, Ayar agreed to purchase an additional 21,470,459 shares of our common stock. On October 31, 2024, we consummated the private placement of shares to Ayar pursuant to the 2024 Subscription Agreement, at a price per share of $2.59, for aggregate net proceeds of $1,025.7 million after deducting issuance costs of $0.8 million.
Potential Impact of an Economic Downturn on our Business
A global economic recession or other economic downturn, whether due to inflation, global conflicts or other geopolitical events, public health crises, interest rate increases or other policy actions by major central banks, 
government closures of banks and liquidity concerns at other financial institutions, 
or other factors, may have an adverse impact on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Adverse economic conditions as well as uncertainty about the current and future global economic conditions may cause our customers to defer purchases or cancel their orders in response to higher interest rates, availability of consumer credit, decreased cash availability, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and weakened consumer confidence. Reduced demand for our products may result in significant decreases in our product sales, which in turn would have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Due to our premium brand positioning and pricing, an economic downturn is likely to have a heightened adverse effect on us compared to many of our electric vehicle and traditional automotive industry competitors, to the extent that consumer demand for luxury goods is reduced in favor of lower-priced alternatives. In addition, an economic recession or other economic downturn could also cause logistical challenges and other operational risks if any of our suppliers, sub-suppliers or partners become insolvent or are otherwise unable to continue their operations, fulfill their obligations to us, or meet our future demand. In addition, the deterioration of conditions in global credit markets may limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures on terms favorable to us, if at all. See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report for more information regarding risks associated with a global economic recession, including under the caption 
“A global economic recession, government closures of banks and liquidity concerns at other financial institutions, or other downturn may have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.”

Key Factors Affecting Our Performance

We believe that our future success and financial performance depend on a number of factors that present significant opportunities for our business, but also pose risks and challenges, including those discussed below and in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report.
Design and Technology Leadership

We believe that we are positioned to be a leader in the electric vehicle market by unlocking the potential for advanced, high-performance, and long-range electric vehicles to co-exist. We design the Lucid Air and the Lucid Gravity with race-proven battery and powertrain technologies, offering robust performance together with a sleek exterior design and expansive interior space due to our miniaturized key drivetrain components. The Lucid Gravity is a groundbreaking new class of SUV, conceived from the ground up. Enabled by our revolutionary technology, the Lucid Gravity provides the interior space and practicality of a full-size SUV within the exterior footprint of a mid-size SUV. As a result, it provides a sophisticated space for up to seven adults, game-changing versatility, and an unparalleled driving experience.
The Lucid Air and the Lucid Gravity are true software-defined vehicles, designed to improve over time, with OTA software updates and key hardware already in place in the vehicle. This holistic systems approach to the integration of hardware and software is what allows us to provide these value-add updates and is what sets us apart in the automotive industry.
The Lucid Gravity is designed to share components with the Lucid Air where possible, and we continue to evaluate opportunities to apply components developed for the Lucid Gravity to the Lucid Air, further expanding the number of common parts while also enhancing the customer experience in the Lucid Air. We anticipate that all of these measures will enable efficiency in design, engineering, and capital expenditure deployment for the Lucid Gravity. We anticipate continued consumer demand for the Lucid Air based on its luxurious design, high-performance technology, sustainability leadership, and the growing acceptance of and demand for electric vehicles as substitutes for gasoline-fueled vehicles. We also expect that these attributes will drive customer demand for the Lucid Gravity, and our future models, including our Midsize platform.
Direct-to-Consumer Model

We operate a direct-to-consumer sales and service model, which we believe allows us to offer a personalized experience for our customers based on their purchase and ownership preferences. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses in our sales, service and marketing operations for sale of the Lucid Air, the Lucid Gravity, and other electric vehicles that we may offer over the coming decade, including to open additional studios, expand our sales force, grow marketing and brand awareness, and establish a robust service center operation. As of December 31, 2024, we have opened 57 studios and service centers (excluding temporary and satellite service centers): 37 in the United States (12 in California, four in each of Florida and New York, two in each of Arizona, Illinois, Massachusetts, Texas, Virginia and Washington, and one in each of Colorado, Georgia, Michigan, New Jersey and Pennsylvania), five in Canada, seven in Germany, two in Switzerland, one in Netherlands, one in Norway, three in Saudi Arabia, and one in the United Arab Emirates. We also plan to hire additional sales, customer service, and service center personnel. We believe that investing in our direct-to-consumer sales and service model will be critical to delivering and servicing the Lucid electric vehicles we manufacture and sell. 
Establishing Manufacturing Capacity

Achieving commercialization and growth for each generation of our electric vehicles requires us to make significant capital expenditures to scale our production capacity and improve our supply chain processes in the United States and internationally. We expect our capital expenditures to increase as we continue constructing the completely-built-up (“CBU”) portion of AMP-2 and expanding AMP-1. The amount and timing of our future manufacturing capacity requirements, and resulting capital expenditures, will depend on many factors, including the pace and results of our research and development efforts to meet technological development milestones, our ability to develop and launch new electric vehicles, our ability to achieve sales and meet customer demand at anticipated levels, our ability to utilize planned capacity in our existing facilities and our ability to enter new markets. 
Technology Innovation
We develop in-house battery and powertrain technology, which requires significant capital investment in research and development. The electric vehicle market is highly competitive, including both established automotive manufacturers and new entrants. To establish market position and attract customers, we plan to continue making substantial investments in research and development for the commercialization and continued enhancements of the Lucid Air and the Lucid Gravity, the development of our Midsize platform, as well as future generations of our electric vehicles and other products.

We recognize revenue from vehicle sales when the customer obtains control of the vehicle, which is upon delivery. We also generate revenue from non-warranty after-sales vehicle services and parts, sales of battery pack systems, powertrain kits, retail merchandise, and regulatory credits. We generate regulatory credits revenue from the sale of tradable credits we earn under various regulations. This include credits related to zero emission vehicles and greenhouse gas, and the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (“CAFE”) credits.
Revenue increased by $212.6 million, or 36%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by an increase of 4,240 in deliveries of the Lucid Air vehicles and an increase of $29.1 million of regulatory credit sales, partially offset by a lower average selling price of vehicles for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.

Cost of vehicle sales includes direct parts, materials, shipping and handling costs, allocable overhead costs such as depreciation of manufacturing related equipment and facilities, information technology costs, personnel costs, including wages and stock-based compensation, estimated warranty costs, charges to reduce inventories to their net realizable value, charges for any excess or obsolete inventories, and losses from firm purchase commitments. Cost of vehicle sales also includes depreciation of operating lease vehicles. Manufacturing credits earned are recorded as a reduction to cost of vehicle sales.
Cost of other revenue includes direct parts, material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including depreciation of tooling costs, shipping and logistic costs. Cost of other revenue also includes costs associated with providing non-warranty after-sales services and costs for retail merchandise.
Cost of revenue decreased by $205.1 million, or 11%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to the decreases in inventory write-downs including losses from firm purchase commitments, and lower material and other cost, partially offset by higher deliveries of the Lucid Air vehicles.

We expect our cost per vehicle to improve in fiscal year 2025 as compared to fiscal year 2024 while ramping up production volumes. In the near term, we expect our production volume of vehicles to continue to be less than our manufacturing capacity.
We recorded write-downs of $617.4 million and $926.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, to reduce our inventories to their net realizable values, for any excess or obsolete inventories, and losses from firm purchase commitments. The decrease in the inventory write-downs and losses from firm purchase commitments and reduction of inventory obsolescence was primarily due to improvement of cost per unit and lower inventory balance for the year ended December 31, 2024. We expect inventory write-downs could negatively affect our costs of vehicle sales in upcoming periods in the near term as we ramp production volumes up toward our manufacturing capacity.
On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”) was enacted with clean energy incentives. For the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the impact of the IRA on our results of operations was not material. We will continue to evaluate the expected future impact of the IRA on our business and financial statements upon the issuance of additional regulatory guidance.
81
Gross profit losses decreased by $417.7 million, or 31% for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily driven by improvement in costs, decrease in inventory write-downs and losses from firm purchase commitments, partially offset by a lower average selling price of vehicles.

Research and Development

Our research and development efforts have primarily focused on the development of our battery and powertrain technology, the Lucid Air, the Lucid Gravity, and future generations of our electric vehicles, including our Midsize platform. Research and development expenses primarily consist of materials, supplies and personnel-related expenses for employees involved in the engineering, designing, and testing of electric vehicles. Personnel-related expenses primarily include salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation. In addition, research and development expenses include prototype material, engineering, design and testing services, and allocated facilities costs, such as office and rent expense and depreciation expense.
Research and development expense increased by $239.4 million, or 26%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to higher personnel-related expenses of $198.5 million ($164.0 million increase due to our growth in headcount and $34.5 million higher stock-based compensation expenses) and an increase of $54.3 million for prototype material, engineering, design and testing services primarily related to Lucid Gravity, partially offset by lower utilization of contractors and professional fees of $26.5 million.
Selling, General, and Administrative

Selling, general, and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses for employees involved in general corporate, selling and marketing functions, including executive management and administration, legal, human resources, facilities and real estate, accounting, finance, tax, and information technology. Personnel-related expenses primarily include salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation. Selling, general, and administrative expenses also include allocated facilities costs, such as office, rent and depreciation expenses, professional services fees, sales and marketing expenses and other general corporate expenses. As we continue to grow as a company, build out our sales force, and commercialize the Lucid Air and Lucid Gravity, and future generations of our electric vehicles, including the development of our Midsize platform, we expect that our selling, general and administrative costs will increase. 
Selling, general, and administrative expense increased by $103.7 million, or 13%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to higher personnel-related expenses of $82.6 million ($89.2 million increase due to our growth in headcount, partially offset by $6.6 million lower stock-based compensation expense), an increase in sales and marketing expenses of $19.9 million, and an increase of $14.6 million in allocated facilities costs, partially offset by a decrease of $12.6 million in other general corporate expenses.
Restructuring Charges
On May 24, 2024, we announced a restructuring plan (the “2024 Restructuring Plan”) intended to optimize operating expenses in response to evolving business needs and productivity improvement through a reduction in workforce. We substantially completed the 2024 Restructuring Plan in 2024. 
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded restructuring charges of $20.3 million related to the 2024 Restructuring Plan within restructuring charges in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The restructuring charges were primarily related to severance payments, employee benefits, employee transition and stock-based compensation, net of a reversal of previously recognized stock-based compensation expense. 
82
On March 28, 2023, we announced a restructuring plan (the “2023 Restructuring Plan”) intended to reduce operating expenses in response to evolving business needs and productivity improvement through a reduction in workforce. We completed the 2023 Restructuring Plan during the first quarter of 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded restructuring charges of $24.5 million. The restructuring charges were primarily related to severance payments, employee benefits, employee transition and stock-based compensation, net of a reversal of previously recognized stock-based compensation expense.

Change in Fair Value of Common Stock Warrant Liability 
Our common stock warrant liability relates to the privately placed common stock warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) to purchase shares of our common stock that were effectively issued upon the closing in connection with the merger. Our common stock warrant liability is subject to remeasurement to fair value at each reporting period. 
The Private Placement Warrants remained unexercised as of December 31, 2024. The liability was remeasured to fair value, resulting in gains of $34.2 million and $86.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and was classified within change in fair value of common stock warrant liability in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. See Note 7 “Common Stock Warrant Liability” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for more information.
Change in Fair Value of Equity Securities of a Related Party
On November 6, 2023, pursuant to the terms of the Implementation Agreement, integration and supply arrangements became effective, under which we will provide Aston Martin access to our powertrain, battery system, and software technologies, work with Aston Martin to integrate our powertrain and battery components with Aston Martin’s battery electric vehicle chassis, and supply powertrain and battery components to Aston Martin (collectively, the “Strategic Technology Arrangement”). In connection with the commencement of the Strategic Technology Arrangement with Aston Martin, we received 28,352,273 ordinary shares of Aston Martin (subject to a lock-up provision of 365 days from its issuance). The ordinary shares of Aston Martin are subject to remeasurement to fair value at each reporting period. Such shares were initially measured at a fair value of $73.2 million and were remeasured to a fair value of $37.8 million and $81.5 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in fair value resulted in an unrealized loss of $43.1 million and an unrealized gain of $6.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and was classified within change in fair value of equity securities of a related party in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. See Note 5 “Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments” and Note 16 “Related Party Transactions” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for more information.
Change in Fair Value of Derivative Liabilities Associated with Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock (Related Party)
In March 2024, we entered into a subscription agreement (the “Series A Subscription Agreement”) with Ayar. Pursuant to the Series A Subscription Agreement, Ayar agreed to purchase from us 100,000 shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock”) for an aggregate purchase price of $1.0 billion in a private placement. Subsequently, in March 2024, we issued the shares to Ayar pursuant to the Series A Subscription Agreement and received aggregate net proceeds of $997.6 million after deducting issuance costs of $2.4 million.
In August 2024, we entered into the Series B Subscription Agreement with Ayar. Pursuant to the Series B Subscription Agreement, Ayar agreed to purchase from us 75,000 shares of our Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $750.0 million in a private placement. Subsequently, in August 2024, we issued the shares to Ayar pursuant to the Series B Subscription Agreement and received aggregate net proceeds of $749.4 million after deducting issuance costs of $0.6 million.

We concluded that the conversion features, inclusive of all settlement outcomes where the pay-off is indexed to the if-converted value, meets all the requirements to be separately accounted for as a bifurcated derivative. As a result, we bifurcated the Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock”) between (i) the host contracts which are accounted for within mezzanine equity, and (ii) the bifurcated derivative liabilities related to the conversion features. The bifurcated derivatives are remeasured to fair value at each reporting period with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. 
The derivative liabilities of the Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock were initially measured at fair values of $497.1 million and $297.7 million, respectively. The derivative liabilities of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock were remeasured to a fair value of $639.4 million as of December 31, 2024. We recognized a gain of $88.3 million related to the Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily driven by the decreases in term to maturity and credit spread, partially offset by an increase in our stock price. We also recognized a gain of $67.1 million related to the Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily driven by decreases in term to maturity, credit spread, and our stock price. We recognized the combined gains of $155.4 million related to the Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock for the year ended December 31, 2024 within change in fair value of derivative liabilities associated with redeemable convertible preferred stock (related party) in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. See Note 8 “Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for more information.
Interest Income
Interest income increased by $8.8 million, or 4%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to higher interest rates from cash on hand and our investments of available for sale securities.
Interest Expense
Interest expense primarily consists of contractual interest and amortization of debt discounts and debt issuance costs incurred related to the 2026 Notes issued in December 2021, commitment fees and amortization of deferred issuance costs from the five-year senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (“ABL Credit Facility”) and the $750.0 million five-year unsecured delayed draw term loan credit facility (the “DDTL Credit Facility”), interest on committed SAR 1.0 billion (approximately $266.1 million) revolving credit facility (the “2023 GIB Credit Facility” and on our finance leases, and capitalized interest on construction in progress related to significant capital asset construction.
Interest expense increased by $8.0 million, or 32%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher interest expense of $4.3 million from the 2023 GIB credit facility resulting from higher average borrowings and commitment fees related to the DDTL Credit Facility, and a decrease of $2.7 million in interest capitalized on construction in progress related to significant capital asset construction during the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.
Other Income (Expense), net
Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses and changes in residual value guarantee reserve. Our foreign currency exchange gains and losses relate to transactions and monetary asset and liability balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We expect our foreign currency gains and losses to continue to fluctuate in the future due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Other income (expense), net changed by $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to changes in foreign exchange rates and residual value guarantee reserve.

Our provision for income taxes consists primarily of U.S., state and foreign income taxes in jurisdictions in which we operate. We maintain a valuation allowance against the full value of our U.S. and state net deferred tax assets because we believe it is more likely than not that the recoverability of these deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Sources of Liquidity
As of December 31, 2024, we had $5,043.2 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments and $37.8 million of investment in equity securities of a related party. We also had $750.0 million, $163.8 million, and $139.2 million of unused available credit amounts from the DDTL Credit Facility, the ABL Credit Facility, and the 2023 GIB Credit Facility, respectively, as of December 31, 2024. Our existing sources of liquidity include cash, cash equivalents, investments, and credit facilities. We funded operations primarily with issuances of common stock, convertible preferred stock and convertible notes.
We expect that our current sources of liquidity together with our projection of cash flows from operating activities will provide us with adequate liquidity for at least the next 12 months, including investment in funding (i) ongoing operations, (ii) research and development projects for new products/ technologies, (iii) further construction of AMP-1 phase 2 in Casa Grande, Arizona, (iv) construction of the CBU portion of AMP-2 in Saudi Arabia, (v) vendor tooling, (vi) expansion of retail studios and service centers, and (vii) other initiatives related to the sale of vehicles and/or technology.
We anticipate our cumulative spending on capital expenditures to be approximately $1.4 billion for the fiscal year 2025 to support our continued commercialization and growth objectives as we strategically invest in manufacturing capacity and capabilities, our retail studios and service center capabilities throughout North America and across the globe, development of different products and technologies, and other areas supporting the growth of Lucid’s business. We expect to continue to receive financing and support for certain capital expenditures in connection with AMP-2 construction and purchases of machinery, tooling, and equipment. Refer to Note 6 “Debt” and Note 16 “Related Party Transactions” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for more information. Our future capital expenditures may vary and will depend on many factors including the timing and extent of spending and other growth initiatives. In addition, we expect our operating expenses to increase in order to grow and support the operations of a global technology automotive company targeting volumes in line with Lucid’s aspirations.
As of December 31, 2024, our total minimum lease payments are $472.7 million, of which $71.3 million is due in fiscal year 2025. We also have non-cancellable long-term commitments of approximately $2.7 billion, primarily relating to certain inventory component purchases. For details regarding these obligations, refer to Note 11 “Leases” and Note 12 “Commitments and Contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for more information. 
2026 Notes
In December 2021, we issued $2,012.5 million of the 2026 Notes. The 2026 Notes accrue interest at a rate of 1.25% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on June 15, 2022. The 2026 Notes will mature on December 15, 2026, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Before the close of business on the business day immediately before September 15, 2026, noteholders will have the right to convert their Notes only upon the occurrence of certain events. From and after September 15, 2026, noteholders may elect at any time to convert their Notes until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. We will settle conversions by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. The initial conversion rate is 18.2548 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $54.78 per share of common stock. The conversion rate and conversion price will be subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, if certain corporate events that constitute a “Make-Whole Fundamental Change” (as defined in the indenture) occur, then the conversion rate will, in certain circumstances, be increased for a specified period of time. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we were in compliance with applicable covenants under the indenture governing the 2026 Notes.
International Manufacturing Expansion
On February 27, 2022, we announced the selection of King Abdullah Economic City (“KAEC”) in Saudi Arabia as the location of our first international manufacturing plant and signed related agreements with the Ministry of Investment of Saudi Arabia, the Saudi Industrial Development Fund, and the Economic City at KAEC. We started the AMP-2 operations with re-assembly of the Lucid Air vehicle “kits” pre-manufactured in the U.S. and, over time, will commence production of complete vehicles.
85
Saudi Industrial Development Fund (“SIDF”) Loan Agreement
On February 27, 2022, Lucid LLC, a limited liability company established in Saudi Arabia and our subsidiary (“Lucid LLC”) entered into a loan agreement (as subsequently amended, the “SIDF Loan Agreement”) with SIDF, a related party of the Public Investment Fund (“PIF”), which is an affiliate of Ayar. Under the SIDF Loan Agreement, SIDF has committed to provide loans (the “SIDF Loans”) to Lucid LLC in an aggregate principal amount of up to SAR 5.19 billion (approximately $1.4 billion); provided that SIDF may reduce the availability of SIDF Loans under the facility in certain circumstances. SIDF Loans will be subject to repayment in semi-annual installments in amounts ranging from SAR 25 million (approximately $6.7 million) to SAR 350 million (approximately $93.1 million), commencing on April 3, 2026 and ending on November 12, 2038. SIDF Loans are financing and will be used to finance certain costs in connection with the development and construction of AMP-2. Lucid LLC may repay SIDF Loans earlier than the maturity date without penalty. Obligations under the SIDF Loan Agreement do not extend to us or any of our other subsidiaries.
SIDF Loans will not bear interest. Instead, Lucid LLC will be required to pay SIDF service fees, consisting of follow-up and technical evaluation fees, ranging, in aggregate, from SAR 415 million (approximately $110.4 million) to SAR 1.77 billion (approximately $471.1 million), over the term of the SIDF Loans. SIDF Loans will be secured by security interests in the equipment, machines and assets funded thereby.
The SIDF Loan Agreement contains certain restrictive financial covenants and imposes annual caps on Lucid LLC’s payment of dividends, distributions of paid-in capital, or certain capital expenditures. The SIDF Loan Agreement also defines customary events of default, including abandonment of or failure to commence operations at the plant in KAEC, and drawdowns under the SIDF Loan Agreement are subject to certain conditions precedent. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, no amount was outstanding under the SIDF Loan Agreement.
Ministry of Investment of Saudi Arabia
 (“
MISA”)
 Agreements 
In February 2022, Lucid LLC entered into agreements with MISA, a related party of the PIF, which is an affiliate of Ayar, pursuant to which MISA has agreed to provide economic support for certain capital expenditures in connection with Lucid LLC’s on-going design and construction of AMP-2. The support by MISA is subject to Lucid LLC’s completion of certain milestones related to the construction and operation of AMP-2. Following the commencement of construction, if operations at the plant do not commence within 30 months, or if the agreed scope of operations is not attained within 55 months, MISA may suspend availability of subsequent support. 
Pursuant to the agreements, MISA has the right to require Lucid LLC to transfer the ownership of AMP-2 to MISA, at the fair market value thereof, reduced by an amortized value of the support provided in the event of customary events of default including abandonment or material and chronically low utilization of AMP-2. Alternatively, Lucid LLC is entitled to avoid the transfer of the ownership of AMP-2 by electing to pay such amortized value. The agreements will terminate on the fifteenth anniversary of the commencement of CBU operations at AMP-2 at the latest.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, we received support of SAR 366 million (approximately $97.3 million) in cash, of which $64.0 million was recorded as deferred liability within other long-term liabilities and $33.3 million was recorded as a deduction in calculating the carrying amount of the related assets in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. Subsequently, we recorded $64.0 million as a deduction in calculating the carrying amount of the related assets in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023. 
During the year ended December 31, 2023, we received support of SAR 366 million (approximately $97.5 million) in cash, of which $62.5 million was recorded as deferred liability within other long-term liabilities and $35.0 million was recorded as a deduction in calculating the carrying amount of the related assets in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2024, we recorded $97.5 million as a deduction in calculating the carrying amount of the related assets in the consolidated balance sheet. There were no unfulfilled conditions and contingencies attached to the payments received. 
GIB Facility Agreement
On April 29, 2022, Lucid LLC entered into a revolving credit facility agreement (the “GIB Facility Agreement”) with GIB, maturing on February 28, 2025. GIB is a related party of the PIF, which is an affiliate of Ayar. The GIB Facility Agreement provided for two committed revolving credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of SAR 1.0 billion (approximately $266.1 million). SAR 650 million (approximately $173.0 million) under the GIB Facility Agreement was available as bridge financing (the “Bridge Facility”) of Lucid LLC’s capital expenditures in connection with AMP-2. The remaining SAR 350 million (approximately $93.1 million) might be used for general corporate purposes (the “Working Capital Facility”). Loans under the Bridge Facility and the Working Capital Facility had a maturity of no more than 12 months. The Bridge Facility incurred interest at a rate of 1.25% per annum over 3-month SAIBOR and the Working Capital Facility incurred interest at a rate of 1.70% per annum over 1~3-month SAIBOR and associated fees. 
86
On March 12, 2023, Lucid LLC entered into an amendment of the GIB Facility Agreement (together with the GIB Facility Agreement, the “2023 Amended GIB Facility Agreement”) to combine the Bridge Facility and the Working Capital Facility into a committed SAR 1.0 billion (approximately $266.1 million) revolving credit facility (the “2023 GIB Credit Facility”) which may be used for general corporate purposes. Loans under the 2023 Amended GIB Credit Facility Agreement have a maturity of no more than 12 months and bear interest at a rate of 1.40% per annum over SAIBOR (based on the term of borrowing) and associated fees.
We are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee of 0.15% per annum based on the unutilized portion of the 2023 GIB Credit Facility. Commitments under the 2023 Amended GIB Facility Agreement will terminate, and all amounts then outstanding thereunder would become payable, on the maturity date of the 2023 Amended GIB Facility Agreement. The 2023 Amended GIB Facility Agreement contains certain conditions precedent to drawdowns, representations and warranties and covenants of Lucid LLC and events of default.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had outstanding borrowings of SAR 475 million (approximately

$126.4 million) and SAR 272 million (approximately $72.5 million), respectively. The weighted average interest rate on the outstanding borrowings was 7.04%

and 7.49% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, availability under the 2023 GIB Credit Facility was SAR 523 million (approximately $139.2 million) and SAR 727 million (approximately $193.9 million), respectively, after giving effect to the outstanding letters of credit. The outstanding borrowings were recorded within other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we were in compliance with applicable covenants under the 2023 Amended GIB Facility Agreement.
On February 24, 2025, Lucid LLC entered into an agreement to renew the 2023 GIB Credit Facility (the “2025 GIB Credit Facility”) maturing on February 24, 2028 to increase the credit facility committed amount from SAR 1.0 billion (approximately $266.1 million) to SAR 1.9 billion (approximately $506.7 million). Loans under the 2025 GIB Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes, have a maturity of no more than 12 months, and bear interest at a rate of 1.40% per annum over SAIBOR (based on the term of borrowing) and associated fees. See Note 18 “Subsequent Event” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for more information.
ABL Credit Facility
In June 2022, we entered into the ABL Credit Facility with a syndicate of banks that may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. The ABL Credit Facility provides for an initial aggregate principal commitment amount of up to $1.0 billion (including a $350.0 million letter of credit subfacility and a $100.0 million swingline loan subfacility) and has a stated maturity date of June 9, 2027. Borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility bear interest at the applicable interest rates specified in the credit agreement governing the ABL Credit Facility. 
In June 2024, we amended the ABL Credit Facility to update the Canadian reference rate.
 Availability under the ABL Credit Facility is subject to the value of eligible assets in the borrowing base and is reduced by outstanding loan borrowings and issuances of letters of credit which bear customary letter of credit fees. Subject to certain terms and conditions, we may request one or more increases in the amount of credit commitments under the ABL Credit Facility in an aggregate amount up to the sum of $500.0 million plus certain other amounts. We are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee of 0.25% per annum based on the unutilized portion of the ABL Credit Facility. 
The ABL Credit Facility contains customary covenants that limit our ability and our restricted subsidiaries to, among other activities, pay dividends, incur debt, create liens and encumbrances, redeem or repurchase stock, dispose of certain assets, consummate acquisitions or other investments, prepay certain debt, engage in transactions with affiliates, engage in sale and leaseback transactions or consummate mergers and other fundamental changes. The ABL Credit Facility also includes a minimum liquidity covenant which, at our option following satisfaction of certain pre-conditions, may be replaced with a springing, minimum fixed charge coverage ratio financial covenant, in each case on terms set forth in the credit agreement governing the ABL Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we were in compliance with applicable covenants under the ABL Credit Facility.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility. Outstanding letters of credit under the ABL Credit Facility were $56.9 million and $45.4 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Availability under the ABL Credit Facility was $354.9 million (including $191.1 million cash and cash equivalents) and $413.4 million (including $144.0 million cash and cash equivalents) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, after giving effect to the borrowing base and the outstanding letters of credit. 
DDTL Credit Facility
In August 2024, we entered into the DDTL Credit Facility with Ayar that may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. The DDTL Credit Facility provides for a delayed draw term loan credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $750.0 million and has a stated maturity date of August 4, 2029. Borrowings under the DDTL Credit Facility bear interest at the applicable interest rates specified in the credit agreement governing the DDTL Credit Facility. We are required to pay a quarterly undrawn fee of 0.50% per annum based on the unutilized portion of the DDTL Credit Facility.
87
The DDTL Credit Facility contains customary covenants that limit our ability and our restricted subsidiaries to, among other activities, pay dividends, incur debt, create liens and encumbrances, redeem or repurchase stock, dispose of certain assets, consummate acquisitions or other investments, prepay certain debt, engage in sale and leaseback transactions or consummate mergers and other fundamental changes. The DDTL Credit Facility also includes a minimum liquidity covenant. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with applicable covenants under the DDTL Credit Facility.
As of December 31, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under the DDTL Credit Facility.
At-the-Market Offering, Subscription Agreements and Underwriting Agreements
In December 2022, we completed our at-the-market offering program (the “At-the-Market Offering”) pursuant to the equity distribution agreement for net proceeds of $594.3 million after deducting commissions and other issuance costs and also consummated a private placement of shares to Ayar (the “2022 Subscription Agreement”) pursuant to the 2022 Subscription Agreement for $915.0 million. 
In June 2023, we completed the public offering pursuant to the 2023 Underwriting Agreement for aggregate net proceeds of $1.2 billion and also consummated a private placement of shares to Ayar pursuant to the 2023 Subscription Agreement for aggregate net proceeds of $1.8 billion after deducting issuance costs. See Note 9 “Stockholders’ Equity” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for more information.
In March 2024, we issued 100,000 shares of our Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock to Ayar pursuant to the Series A Subscription Agreement and received aggregate net proceeds of $997.6 million after deducting issuance costs. In August 2024, we also issued 75,000 shares of our Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock to Ayar pursuant to the Series B Subscription Agreement and received aggregate net proceeds of $749.4 million after deducting issuance costs. See Note 8 “Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for more information.
In October 2024, we completed the public offering pursuant to the 2024 Underwriting Agreement and received net proceeds of $718.4 million and also consummated the private placement of shares to Ayar pursuant to the 2024 Subscription Agreement for net proceeds of $1,025.7 million after deducting issuance costs. See Note 9 “Stockholders’ Equity” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for more information. 
We have generated significant losses from our operations as reflected in our accumulated deficit of $12.9 billion and $10.2 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Additionally, we have generated significant negative cash flows from operations and investing activities as we continue to support the growth of our business. 
The expenditures associated with the development and commercial launch of our vehicles, the anticipated increase in manufacturing capacity, and the international expansion of our business operations are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and therefore, may affect the timing and magnitude of these anticipated expenditures. These risk and uncertainties are described in more detail in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report.

Cash Used in Operating Activities
Our cash flows used in operating activities to date have been primarily comprised of cash outlays to support overall growth of the business, especially the costs related to inventory and sale of our vehicles, costs related to research and development, payroll and other general and administrative activities. As we continue to ramp up hiring after starting commercial operations, we expect our cash used in operating activities to increase significantly before it starts to generate any material cash flows from our business. 
88
Net cash used in operating activities decreased by $470.1 million to $2,019.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to an overall decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of $635.7 million, partially offset by an increase in net loss excluding non-cash expenses and gains of $165.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The change in net operating assets and liabilities was primarily attributable to a decrease in inventory of $323.8 million due to lower purchases of raw materials and continuous improvement in inventory management, and a decrease in accounts payable of $174.3 million due to timing of payments. The decreases were partially offset by an increase in other current assets of $145.9 million due to an increase in advanced payments to suppliers recorded during the year ended December 31, 2024.
Cash Used in Investing Activities
Our cash flows used in investing activities primarily relate to purchases of investments and capital expenditures to support our growth, net of proceeds from maturities of investments. 
Net cash used in investing activities increased by $347.5 million to $1,294.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in purchases of investments of $624.6 million, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from maturities of investments of $391.2 million. The increase was also attributable to $97.5 million of proceeds from a government grant we received during the year ended December 31, 2023.
Cash Provided by Financing Activities
Since inception, we have financed our operations primarily from the issuances of equity securities, including the At-the-Market Offering, the private placements to Ayar, convertible preferred stock, the proceeds of the merger, and the 2026 Notes.
Net cash provided by financing activities increased by $478.8 million to $3,549.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. We received net proceeds of $1,744.0 million from the issuance of common stock under the 2024 Subscription Agreement and Underwriting Agreement, $997.6 million from the issuance of Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock, and $749.4 million from the issuance of Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock during the year ended December 31, 2024. We also received net proceeds of $2,996.9 million from the issuance of common stock under the 2023 Subscription Agreement and the 2023 Underwriting Agreement during the year ended December 31, 2023.
Critical Accounting Estimates

The consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures in our financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates and any such differences may be material.
We believe that the following accounting policies involve a high degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of our operations. For more information about our accounting policies, see Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Revenue Recognition
We follow a five-step process in which we identify the contract, identify the related performance obligations, determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction price to the identified performance obligations, and recognize revenue when (or as) the performance obligations are satisfied. 
Vehicle Sales
Vehicle Sales without Residual Value Guarantee
Vehicle sales revenue is generated from the sale of electric vehicles to customers. There are two performance obligations identified in vehicle sale arrangements. These are the vehicle including an onboard advanced driver assistance system (“ADAS”), and the right to unspecified over-the-air (“OTA”) software updates to be provided as and when available over the term of the basic vehicle warranty, which is generally four years. Shipping and handling provided by us is considered a fulfillment activity.
89
Payment is typically received at the time of delivery or shortly after delivery of the vehicle to the customer, except for vehicle sales under the EV Purchase Agreement. Generally, control transfers to the customer at the time of delivery when the customer takes physical possession of the vehicle, which may be at a Lucid studio or other destination chosen by the customer. Our vehicle contracts do not contain a significant financing component. We have elected to exclude sales taxes from the measurement of the transaction price. We estimate the standalone selling price of all performance obligations by considering costs used to develop and deliver the good or service, third-party pricing of similar goods or services and other information that may be available. The transaction price is allocated among the performance obligations in proportion to the standalone selling price of our performance obligations. 
We recognize revenue related to the vehicle when the customer obtains control of the vehicle which occurs at a point in time either upon completion of delivery to the agreed upon delivery location or upon pick up of the vehicle by the customer. As the unspecified OTA software updates are provided when-and-if they become available, revenue related to OTA software updates is recognized ratably over the basic vehicle warranty term, commencing when control of the vehicle is transferred to the customer.
At the time of revenue recognition, we reduce the transaction price and record a sales return reserve against revenue for estimated variable consideration related to future product returns. Such return rate estimates are based on historical experience.
We provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all vehicles sold. The warranty covers the rectification of reported defects via repair, replacement, or adjustment of faulty parts or components. The warranty does not cover any item where failure is due to normal wear and tear. This assurance-type warranty does not create a performance obligation separate from the vehicle. The estimated cost of the assurance-type warranty is accrued at the time of vehicle sale.
Vehicle Sales with Residual Value Guarantee
We provide a residual value guarantee (“RVG”) to our commercial banking partners in connection with its vehicle leasing program. Under the vehicle leasing program, we generally receive payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery or shortly after delivery, do not bear casualty and credit risks during the lease term, and are contractually obligated (or entitled) to share a portion of the shortfall (or excess) between the resale value realized by the commercial banking partners and a predetermined resale value. At the lease inception, we are required to deposit cash collateral equal to a contractual percentage of the residual value of the leased vehicles with the commercial banking partners. The cash collateral is held in a restricted bank account owned by the commercial banking partner until it is used, as applicable, in settlement of the RVG at the end of the lease term. Cash collateral is recorded in other noncurrent assets, subject to an asset impairment review at each reporting period. 
We account for the vehicle leasing program in accordance with ASC 842, 
Leases, 
ASC 460, 
Guarantees
 and ASC 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
. We are the lessor at inception of a lease and immediately transfer the lease as well as the underlying vehicle to our commercial banking partners, with the transaction being accounted for as a sale under ASC 606. We recognize revenue when control transfers upon delivery when the consumer-lessee takes physical possession of the vehicle, and bifurcate the RVG at fair value and account for it as a guarantee liability. The remaining amount of the transaction price is allocated among the performance obligations, including the vehicle, the right to unspecified 
OTA
 software updates and remarketing activities, in proportion to the standalone selling price of our performance obligations. Any fees or incentives that are paid or payable by us to commercial banking partners are recognized as a reduction to vehicle sales revenue.
The guarantee liability represents the estimated amount we expect to pay at the end of the lease term. We are released from residual risk upon either expiration or settlement of the RVG. We evaluate variables such as third-party residual value publications, risk of future price deterioration due to changes in market conditions and reconditioning costs to determine the estimated residual value guarantee liability. As we accumulate more data related to the resale value of our vehicles or as market conditions change, there could be material changes to the estimated guarantee liabilities.
Vehicle Operating Lease Revenue
We account for sales of vehicles with repurchase obligations as operating leases. We sell vehicles primarily to rental companies with an obligation to repurchase the vehicles at an agreed upon repurchase price. We record the difference between the proceeds received and the agreed upon repurchase price as vehicle leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Deferred leasing revenue and repurchase obligation were recorded in other current liabilities and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
Inventory Valuation
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts. If inventory on-hand is in excess of future demand forecast and market conditions, the excess amounts are written-off. 
90
Inventory is also reviewed to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires an assessment to determine the selling price of the vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written down, a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. 
In the event there are changes in our estimates of future selling prices or production costs, we might be required to record additional and potentially material write-downs. A small change in our estimates may result in a material change in our reported financial results.
We periodically review and record write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts, considering shelf-life and technological obsolescence of certain inventories. Our current and future demand forecasts are based on our historical sales, market share performance, macroeconomic factors and trends in quantities or prices of orders for our products. We evaluate whether raw materials are approaching the end of their shelf-lives or becoming technologically obsolete, and the likelihood that we will be able to use the raw materials in production. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of future demand forecast and market conditions, the excess amounts are provisioned or written-down. 
Once inventory is written-down, a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.
Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock
Accounting for the redeemable convertible preferred stock requires an evaluation to determine if liability classification is required under ASC 480-10. Liability classification is required for freestanding financial instruments that are (1) subject to an unconditional obligation requiring the issuer to redeem the instrument by transferring assets, such as those that are mandatorily redeemable, (2) instruments other than equity shares that embody an obligation of the issuer to repurchase its equity shares, or (3) certain types of instruments that obligate the issuer to issue a variable number of equity shares. 
Securities that do not meet the scoping criteria to be classified as a liability under ASC 480 are subject to redeemable equity guidance, which prescribes securities that may be subject to redemption upon an event not solely within the control of the issuer to be classified as temporary equity. Securities classified in temporary equity are initially measured at the proceeds received, net of issuance costs and excluding the fair value of bifurcated embedded derivatives, if any. Subsequent measurement of the carrying value of the redeemable convertible preferred stock is required as the instrument is probable of becoming redeemable. We accrete the redeemable convertible preferred stock to its redemption value. In certain circumstances, the redemption price may vary based on changes in stock price, in which case we will recognize changes in the redemption value immediately as they occur and adjust the carrying value of the security to equal the then current maximum redemption value at the end of each reporting period.
Derivative Liabilities 
In connection with the issuance of the redeemable convertible preferred stock, we evaluated the instruments for any features that must be bifurcated and separately accounted for as embedded derivatives. We concluded that the conversion features, inclusive of all settlement outcomes where the pay-off is indexed to the if-converted value, meets all the requirements to be separately accounted for as a bifurcated derivative. As a result, we bifurcated the redeemable convertible preferred stock between (i) the host contracts which are accounted for within mezzanine equity, and (ii) the bifurcated derivative liabilities. The proceeds from issuance are first allocated to the fair value of the bifurcated derivatives with the residual being allocated to the host contracts. The bifurcated derivatives are remeasured to fair value each reporting period with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. We estimated the fair value of the derivative liabilities using a binomial lattice model. Inherent in a binomial lattice model are unobservable inputs and assumptions. The inputs for the valuation of the derivative liabilities included the volatility, credit spread, and term. Assumptions used in the valuation also consider the contractual terms as well as the quoted price of our common stock in an active market. Significant changes in any of those inputs in isolation would result in significant changes to the fair value measurement. We remeasure the derivative liabilities at each reporting period and recognize the changes in fair value in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. 
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
See Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for more information.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates, equity price and inflationary pressure. 
91
Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates applicable to our cash and cash equivalents, and investments. We had cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaling approximately $5.04 billion as of December 31, 2024. Our investment policy is focused on the preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity needs. Under the policy, we invest in highly rated securities, primarily issued by the U.S. government or liquid money market funds. We do not invest in financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We utilize external investment managers who adhere to the guidelines of our investment policy. Based on investment positions as of December 31, 2024, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in $26.5 million incremental decline in the fair market value of our portfolio.
Equity Price Risk 
We hold equity securities of Aston Martin Lagonda Global Holdings plc (together with its subsidiaries, “Aston Martin”). The fair value of these equity securities was $37.8 million as of December 31, 2024. Changes in fair value of these equity securities are impacted by the volatility of the stock market and changes in general economic conditions, among other factors. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the stock price of these equity securities would decrease the fair value as of December 31, 2024 by $3.8 million.
Supply Risk
We are dependent on our suppliers, the majority of which are single-source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of its products according to the schedule and at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or its inability to efficiently manage these components, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders 
Lucid Group, Inc.:
Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Lucid Group, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, redeemable convertible preferred stock and stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
Basis for Opinions
The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Evaluation of net realizable value of certain inventories
As discussed in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has inventories with a carrying value of $407.8 million as of December 31, 2024. The Company adjusts the carrying value of inventory when the cost of inventory exceeds the estimated net realizable value. The Company records inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts. Additionally, the Company reviews inventory to determine whether the carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory, requiring the Company to determine the estimated selling price of vehicles and the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product.
We identified the evaluation of the Company’s determination of net realizable value of certain inventories as a critical audit matter. Subjective auditor judgment and significant audit effort were required to assess key inputs within the Company’s determination of net realizable value of certain inventories. Specifically, the key inputs within the calculation include the estimated selling prices and the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s inventory process, including controls related to the estimated selling prices and the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product. We evaluated estimated selling prices by comparing them to internal sales documentation, actual sales, peer company data, and relevant market information. We evaluated the Company’s ability to accurately forecast the estimated cost to convert inventory on-hand by comparing historical production projections to actual results. We assessed the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand by comparing it to future sales projections. For certain inventories, we also evaluated the estimated cost to convert inventory on-hand by comparing the historical estimated cost to convert to actual results. 
Evaluation of redeemable convertible preferred stock issuances
As discussed in Notes 2, 8 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements, in March 2024, the Company entered into the Series A Subscription Agreement with a related party. Pursuant to the Series A Subscription Agreement, the related party purchased 100,000 shares of the Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $1.0 billion in a private placement. In addition, in August 2024, the Company entered into the Series B Subscription Agreement with the same related party. Pursuant to the Series B Subscription Agreement, the related party purchased 75,000 shares of the Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $750.0 million in a private placement. The Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock and the Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock (the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock) are convertible at the option of the holder (i) at any time the closing price per share of the common stock on the trading date immediately preceding the date on which the holder delivers the relevant notice of conversion is at least a certain price threshold or (ii) during specified periods preceding a fundamental change or optional redemption by the Company under the terms of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock. As of December 31, 2024, the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock mezzanine equity and derivative liabilities were $1.3 billion and $639.4 million, respectively. 
We identified the assessment of the initial US GAAP accounting treatment of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock as a critical audit matter. Specifically, the evaluation of the appropriate accounting treatment, including: 1) determination of whether the preferred stock was a debt or equity host, 2) identification of the embedded features, and 3) determination of whether any of the embedded features require bifurcation and separate accounting, involved complex, challenging and subjective auditor judgments. In addition, a high degree of auditor judgment was involved in determining the nature and extent of the procedures performed and audit evidence obtained to evaluate the Company's conclusions.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of an internal control related to the initial accounting treatment of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock. We obtained and reviewed the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock agreements to understand the terms, conditions, and features within the agreements to assist in (i) evaluating relevant contract terms and conditions of the agreements in relation to the appropriate accounting literature, (ii) comparing the relevant terms and provisions to management’s analysis, and (iii) assessing the appropriateness of conclusions reached by the Company with respect to the initial accounting treatment, including the determination of the host contract, and identification and bifurcation of embedded features within the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock. We evaluated the conclusions made by the Company related to the accounting treatment for issuance of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock, including the Company’s conclusions of relevant accounting standards to analyze and assess the identification and determination of embedded features requiring bifurcation and separate accounting of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock.

LUCID GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2024
NOTE 1
 – 
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Overview
Lucid Group, Inc. (“Lucid”) is a technology company that is setting new standards with the world’s most advanced electric vehicles (“EV”), the award-winning Lucid Air and all-new Lucid Gravity.
Throughout the notes to the consolidated financial statements, unless otherwise noted, the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” and similar terms refer to Legacy Lucid and its subsidiaries prior to the consummation of the merger, and Lucid and its subsidiaries after the consummation of the merger.
Liquidity
The Company devotes its efforts to business planning, selling and servicing of vehicles, providing technology access, research and development, construction and expansion of manufacturing facilities, expansion of retail studios and service center capacities, recruiting of management and technical staff, acquiring operating assets, and raising capital.
From inception through December 31, 2024, the Company has incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from operating activities. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company has incurred net losses of $
2.7
 billion, $
2.8
 billion and $
1.3
 billion, respectively. The Company had an accumulated deficit of $
12.9
 billion as of December 31, 2024. 
The Company completed the first phase of the construction of its Advanced Manufacturing Plant-1 in Casa Grande, Arizona (“AMP-1”) in 2021, transitioned general assembly to the AMP-1 phase 2 manufacturing facility and completed the semi knocked-down (“SKD”) portion of its Advanced Manufacturing Plant-2 in Saudi Arabia (“AMP-2”) in September 2023. The Company also completed key manufacturing activities, including the paint shop, stamping, a new body shop for the Lucid Gravity, and a majority of the powertrain shop, of the AMP-1 phase 2 manufacturing facility in 2024. The Company began commercial production of its first vehicle, the Lucid Air, in September 2021 and delivered its first vehicles in late October 2021. Currently, the AMP-1 phase 2 facility manufactures the Lucid Air and the Lucid Gravity. The Company continues to expand AMP-1, construct the completely-built-up (“CBU”) portion of AMP-2, and build a network of retail sales and service locations. The Company has plans for continued development of additional vehicle model types for future release. The aforementioned activities will require considerable capital, which is above and beyond the expected cash inflows from the initial sales of the Lucid Air. As such, the future operating plan involves considerable risk if secure funding sources are not identified and confirmed.
The Company’s existing sources of liquidity include cash, cash equivalents, investments, and credit facilities. The Company funded operations primarily with issuances of common stock, convertible preferred stock, and convertible notes.
In 2022, the Company entered into a loan agreement with the Saudi Industrial Development Fund (“SIDF”) with an aggregate principal amount of up to approximately $
1.4
 billion, a 
five-year
 senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (“ABL Credit Facility”) with an initial aggregate principal commitment amount of up to $
1.0
 billion, and revolving credit facilities (the “GIB Facility Agreement”) with Gulf International Bank (“GIB”) in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $
266.1
 million. The GIB Facility Agreement provided for 
two
 committed revolving credit facilities, of which $
173.0
 million was available as a bridge financing (the “Bridge Facility”) and $
93.1
 million was for general corporate purposes (the “Working Capital Facility”). 
In March 2023, the Company amended the GIB Facility Agreement (together with the GIB Facility Agreement, the “2023 Amended GIB Facility Agreement”) to combine the Bridge Facility and the Working Capital Facility into a committed $
266.1
 million revolving credit facility (the “2023 GIB Credit Facility”), which bears interest at a rate of 
1.40
% per annum over SAIBOR (based on the term of borrowing) and associated fees. See Note 6 “Debt” for more information. 
In February 2025, Lucid LLC, a limited liability company established in Saudi Arabia and a subsidiary of the Company (“Lucid LLC”), entered into an agreement to renew the 2023 GIB Credit Facility (the “2025 GIB Credit Facility”) maturing on February 24, 2028 to increase the credit facility committed amount from SAR 
1.0
 billion (approximately $
266.1
 million) to SAR 
1.9
 billion (approximately $
506.7
 million). Loans under the 2025 GIB Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes, have a maturity of no more than 
12
 months, and bear interest at a rate of 
1.40
% per annum over SAIBOR (based on the term of borrowing) and associated fees. See Note 18 “Subsequent Event” for more information.
102
In November 2022, the Company entered into an equity distribution agreement (the “Equity Distribution Agreement”) with BofA Securities, Inc., Barclays Capital Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., under which the Company could offer and sell shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price up to $
600.0
 million (the “At-the-Market Offering”).

103
Certain Significant Risks and Uncertainties
The Company’s current business activities consist of (i) generating sales from the deliveries and service of vehicles, (ii) research and development efforts to design, engineer and develop high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components, including battery pack systems, (iii) construction of the CBU portion of AMP-2 in Saudi Arabia, (iv) further construction of AMP-1 phase 2 in Casa Grande, Arizona, (v) expansion of its retail studios and service centers capabilities throughout North America and across the globe, and (vi) providing its technology access to third parties. The Company is subject to the risks associated with such activities, including the need to further develop its technology, its marketing, and distribution channels; the need to further develop its supply chain and manufacturing; and the need to hire additional management and other employees. Successful completion of the Company’s development program and, ultimately, the attainment of profitable operations are dependent upon future events, including our ability to access potential markets, and secure long-term financing on commercially reasonable terms.
The Company participates in a dynamic high-technology industry. Changes in any of the following areas could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s future financial position, results of operations, and/or cash flows: changes in the overall demand for its products and services; advances and trends in new technologies; competitive pressures; acceptance of the Company’s products and services; litigation or claims against the Company based on intellectual property (including patents), regulatory, or other factors; and the Company’s ability to attract and retain employees necessary to support its business operations.
A global economic recession or other economic downturn, whether due to inflation, global conflicts or other geopolitical events, public health crises, interest rate increases or other policy actions by major central banks, government closures of banks and liquidity concerns at other financial institutions, or other factors, may have an adverse impact on the Company’s business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Adverse economic conditions as well as uncertainty about the current and future global economic conditions may cause the Company’s customers to defer purchases or cancel their orders in response to higher interest rates, availability of consumer credit, decreased cash availability, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and weakened consumer confidence. Reduced demand for the Company’s products may result in significant decreases in product sales, which in turn would have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Because of the Company’s premium brand positioning and pricing, an economic downturn is likely to have a heightened adverse effect on the Company compared to many of its electric vehicle and traditional automotive industry competitors, to the extent that consumer demand for luxury goods is reduced in favor of lower-priced alternatives. In addition, any economic recession or other economic downturn could also cause logistical challenges and other operational risks if any of the Company’s suppliers, sub-suppliers or partners become insolvent or are otherwise unable to continue their operations, fulfill their obligations to the Company, or meet the Company’s future demand. In addition, the deterioration of conditions in the broad financing markets may limit the Company’s ability to obtain external financing to fund its operations and capital expenditures on terms favorable to the Company, if at all. See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I of this 
Annual Report 
on Form 10-K (the “Annual Report”) for more information regarding risks associated with a global economic recession, including under the caption “
A global economic recession, government closures of banks and liquidity concerns at other financial institutions, or other downturn may have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition
.
”
In the current circumstances, any impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the future continues to be difficult to estimate and predict, as it depends on future events that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with accuracy.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries.

All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Certain prior-period amounts have been reclassified in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in order to conform to the current period presentation.
Segment Reporting
Operating segments are defined as components of an entity for which separate financial information is available and that is regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources to an individual segment and in assessing performance. The Company’s CODM is its Chief Executive Officer. The Company has determined that it operates in 
one
 operating and 
one
 reportable segment, as the CODM reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions, allocating resources, and evaluating financial performance.
104
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates, assumptions and judgments made by management include, among others, inventory valuation, warranty reserve, useful lives of property, plant and equipment, fair value of common stock warrants, fair value of derivative liabilities associated with the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock, estimates of residual value guarantee (“RVG”) liability, deferred revenue related to technology access fees and over-the-air (“OTA”) software updates, sales return reserves, assumptions used to measure stock-based compensation expense, income taxes, and estimated incremental borrowing rates for assessing operating and finance leases. These estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best estimates and judgment. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The Company adjusts such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Changes in those estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity at the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 
Restricted cash in other current assets is primarily related to letters of credit issued to the landlords for certain of the Company’s leased facilities.
The following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash to amounts shown in the statements of cash flows (in thousands):

Investments 
The Company’s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale and they are stated at fair value. The Company classifies its investments as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument’s underlying contractual maturity date. Unrealized gains and losses on our investments of available-for-sale securities are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) which is included within stockholders’ equity. Interest, as well as amortization and accretion of purchase premiums and discounts on its investments of available-for-sale securities are included in interest income. The cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method. Realized gains and losses on the sale of available-for-sale securities are recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 
The Company regularly reviews its investment portfolio of 
available-for-sale securities
 for allowance for 
credit lo
sses. Factors considered include severity of declines in fair values below amortized costs, adverse conditions related to securities, creditworthiness of the security issuers, and collectability of principal and interest payments.

Equity Securities
The Company’s equity securities with readily determinable fair value are measured and stated at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

Accounts Receivable, Net
Accounts receivable consists of receivables from our customers and from financial institutions offering financing products to our customers for the sale of vehicles, sales of powertrain kits, services, and regulatory credits. The Company provides an allowance against accounts receivable for any potential uncollectible amounts.
 The Company recorded immaterial allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
105
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, investments and accounts receivable. The Company places its cash primarily with domestic financial institutions that are federally insured within statutory limits, but its deposits exceed federally insured limits.
 As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, accounts receivable from the EV purchase agreement with the Government of Saudi Arabia, a related party of the Public Investment Fund (“PIF”), which is an affiliate of Ayar, as represented by the Ministry of Finance (the “EV Purchase Agreement”), represented 
51.7
% and 
68.5
% of the total accounts receivable balance, respectively. See Note 16 “Related Party Transactions” for more information.
Concentration of Supply Risk
The Company is dependent on its suppliers, the majority of which are single-source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of its products according to the schedule and at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to the Company, or its inability to efficiently manage these components, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.
Inventory
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. The Company records inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts. If inventory on-hand is in excess of future demand forecast and market conditions, the excess amounts are written-off. 
Inventory is also reviewed to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires an assessment to determine the selling price of the vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written down, a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. 
In the event there are changes in our estimates of future selling prices or production costs, the Company may be required to record additional and potentially material write-downs. A small change in the Company’s estimates may result in a material change in its reported financial results.
Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net
Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. 
Interest expense capitalized for significant capital asset construction in progress is included within property, plant and equipment, net and is amortized over the life of the related assets. The Company capitalizes qualified costs incurred during the application development stage of internal use software. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage and post-implementation stage are expensed. 
The Company classifies vehicles sold with repurchase obligations that are accounted for as operating leases within Property, plant and equipment, which are initially measured at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis to the estimated residual value over the contractual period. 
The Company generally uses the following estimated useful lives for each asset category: 
Asset Category
Life (years)
Machinery, tooling and vehicles
3
 - 
15
Computer equipment and software
3
Furniture and fixtures
5
Finance leases
Shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets
Building and improvements
5
 - 
40
Leasehold improvements
Shorter of remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets
Management determines the useful lives of the Company’s property and equipment when those assets are initially recognized and routinely reviews the remaining estimated useful lives. Current estimate of useful lives represents the best estimate of the useful lives based on the Company’s current facts and circumstances, but may differ from the actual useful lives due to changes to its business operations, changes in the planned use of assets, and the technological advancements. When management changes the estimate useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining carrying amount of the asset is accounted for prospectively and depreciated over the revised estimated useful life.
106
Expenditures for repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred, and expenditures for major renewals and improvements that increase functionality of the asset are capitalized and depreciated ratably over the identified useful life. Upon disposition or retirement of property and equipment, the related cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed, and any gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss.
 The disposition loss on fixed assets recorded for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was immaterial.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and 
right-of-use (“ROU”) assets 
are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group be tested for potential impairment, the Company first compares undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the underlying asset exceeds its fair value.
 The Company recognized 
impairment loss
 of 
$
15.3
 million

for the year ended 
December 31, 2023. I
mpairment loss recognized for the years ended 
December 31, 2024 and 2022 was 
immaterial
.
Leases
The Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components and has elected not to utilize the practical expedient to account for lease and non-lease components together, rather the Company accounts for the lease and non-lease components separately in the consolidated financial statements. The Company has also elected not to record ROU assets and corresponding lease liabilities for short-term leases having initial terms of 12 months or less if the leases do not contain a purchase option or renewal term that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise. Instead, the Company recognizes lease payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Operating lease assets are included within operating lease ROU assets. Finance lease assets are included within property, plant and equipment, net. The corresponding operating lease liabilities are included within other current liabilities and other

long-term liabilities; the finance lease liabilities are included within finance lease liabilities, current portion and finance lease liabilities, net of current portion on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
All lease assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company estimates the Company’s incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.
Foreign Currency
The Company determines the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries based on the primary currency in which they operate. The Company translates all assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars at the current exchange rate as of each balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate prevailing during the period. Any resulting translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries whose local currency is not their functional currency are remeasured from their local currency to their functional currency and then translated to U.S. Dollars. 
Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. Gains and losses arising from foreign currency transactions and the effects of remeasurements are recorded within other income (expense), net within the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
 Foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

Revenue from Contracts with Customers
The Company follows a five-step process in which the Company identifies the contract, identifies the related performance obligations, determines the transaction price, allocates the transaction price to the identified performance obligations, and recognizes revenue when (or as) the performance obligations are satisfied. 
Vehicle Sales
Vehicle Sales without Residual Value Guarantee
Vehicle sales revenue is generated from the sale of electric vehicles to customers. There are 
two
 performance obligations identified in vehicle sale arrangements. These are the vehicle including an onboard advanced driver assistance system (“ADAS”), and the right to unspecified OTA software updates to be provided as and when available over the term of the basic vehicle warranty, which is generally 
four years
. Shipping and handling provided by the Company is considered a fulfillment activity.
107
Payment is typically received at the time of delivery or shortly after delivery of the vehicle to the customer, except for vehicle sales under the EV Purchase Agreement. Generally, control transfers to the customer at the time of delivery when the customer takes physical possession of the vehicle, which may be at a Lucid studio or other destination chosen by the customer. The Company’s vehicle contracts do not contain a significant financing component. The Company has elected to exclude sales taxes from the measurement of the transaction price. The Company estimates the standalone selling price of all performance obligations by considering costs used to develop and deliver the good or service, third-party pricing of similar goods or services and other information that may be available. The transaction price is allocated among the performance obligations in proportion to the standalone selling price of the Company’s performance obligations.
The Company recognizes revenue related to the vehicle when the customer obtains control of the vehicle which occurs at a point in time either upon completion of delivery to the agreed upon delivery location or upon pick up of the vehicle by the customer. As the unspecified OTA software updates are provided when-and-if they become available, revenue related to OTA software updates is recognized ratably over the basic vehicle warranty term, commencing when control of the vehicle is transferred to the customer.
At the time of revenue recognition, the Company reduces the transaction price and records a sales return reserve against revenue for estimated variable consideration related to future product returns. Return rate estimates are based on historical experience and the sales return reserve balance was not material as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
The Company provides a manufacturer’s warranty on all vehicles sold. The warranty covers the rectification of reported defects via repair, replacement, or adjustment of faulty parts or components. The warranty does not cover any item where failure is due to normal wear and tear. This assurance-type warranty does not create a performance obligation separate from the vehicle. The estimated cost of the assurance-type warranty is accrued at the time of vehicle sale.
Vehicle Sales with Residual Value Guarantee
The Company provides an RVG to its commercial banking partners in connection with its vehicle leasing program. Vehicle sales with RVG totaled $
442.7
 million, $
190.9
 million, and $
31.1
 million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Under the vehicle leasing program, the Company generally receives payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery or shortly after the delivery, does not bear casualty and credit risks during the lease term, and is contractually obligated (or entitled) to share a portion of the shortfall (or excess) between the resale value realized by the commercial banking partners and a predetermined resale value. At the lease inception, the Company is required to deposit cash collateral equal to a contractual percentage of the residual value of the leased vehicles with the commercial banking partners. The cash collateral is held in a restricted bank account owned by the commercial banking partner until it is used, as applicable, in settlement of the RVG at the end of the lease term. Cash collateral is recorded in other current assets and other noncurrent assets on consolidated balance sheets, subject to an asset impairment review at each reporting period. 
The Company accounts for the vehicle leasing program in accordance with ASC 842, 
Leases, 
ASC 460, 
Guarantees
 and ASC 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
. The Company is the lessor at inception of a lease and immediately transfers the lease as well as the underlying vehicle to its commercial banking partners, with the transaction being accounted for as a sale under ASC 606. The Company recognizes revenue when control transfers upon delivery when the consumer-lessee takes physical possession of the vehicle, and bifurcates the RVG at fair value and accounts for it as a guarantee liability. The remaining amount of the transaction price is allocated among the performance obligations, including the vehicle, the right to unspecified 
OTA
 software updates and remarketing activities, in proportion to the standalone selling price of the Company’s performance obligations. Any fees or incentives that are paid or payable by the Company to commercial banking partners are recognized as a reduction to vehicle sales revenue.
The guarantee liability represents the estimated amount the Company expects to pay at the end of the lease term. The Company is released from residual risk upon either expiration or settlement of the RVG. The Company evaluates variables such as third-party residual value publications, risk of future price deterioration due to changes in market conditions and reconditioning costs to determine the estimated RVG liability. As of December 31, 2024, the Company recorded $
58.0
 million of RVG liabilities. The RVG liabilities were 
not
 material as of December 31, 2023. As the Company accumulates more data related to the resale value of our vehicles or as market conditions change, there could be material changes to the estimated guarantee liabilities. The maximum potential amount of future payments (in excess of RVG liabilities recorded) that the Company could be required to make was $
401.1
 million and $
101.1
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded $
53.3
 million and $
28.7
 million of total deferred revenue from all vehicle sales primarily related to OTA and remarketing activities for vehicle sales, respectively. The Company recorded $
18.5
 million and $
7.7
 million of the total deferred revenue within other current liabilities and the remaining $
34.8
 million and $
21.0
 million within other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Revenue recognized during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 from the prior period deferred revenue balances was not material.
108
Vehicle Operating Lease Revenue
The Company accounts for sales of vehicles with repurchase obligations as operating leases. The Company sells vehicles primarily to rental companies with an obligation to repurchase the vehicles at an agreed upon repurchase price. The Company records the difference between the proceeds received and the agreed upon repurchase price as vehicle leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Deferred leasing revenue and repurchase obligation were recorded in other current liabilities and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, and were not material as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. The operating lease revenue was not material for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. 
Other
Other consists of revenue from non-warranty after-sales vehicle services and parts, sales of battery pack systems, powertrain kits, retail merchandise, and regulatory credits. Battery pack system and powertrain kits revenue consists of the sales of battery pack systems or powertrain kits, supplies and related services for vehicles. The Company generates regulatory credits revenue from the sale of tradable credits the Company earns under various regulations. This include credits related to zero emission vehicles and greenhouse gas, and the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (“CAFE”) credits. The sale of battery pack systems, powertrain kits along with related supplies, and regulatory credits is a single performance obligation recognized at the point in time when control is transferred to the customer. Shipping and handling provided by the Company is considered a fulfillment activity. While customers generally have the right to return defective or non-conforming products, past experience has demonstrated that product returns have been immaterial. Customer remedies may include either a cash refund or an exchange of the returned product. Payment for the products sold are received upon invoice or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. The Company’s battery pack system or powertrain kits contracts do not contain a significant financing component. The Company has elected to exclude sales taxes from the measurement of the transaction price. 
Control transfers to the customer when the product or regulatory credit is delivered or transferred to the customer as the customer can then direct the use of the product or regulatory credit and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the asset at that point in time.

Cost of Revenue
Vehicle Sales 
Cost of vehicle sales includes direct parts, materials, shipping and handling costs, allocable overhead costs such as depreciation of manufacturing related equipment and facilities, information technology costs, personnel costs, including wages and stock-based compensation, estimated warranty costs, charges to reduce inventories to their net realizable value, charges for any excess or obsolete inventories, and losses from firm purchase commitments. Manufacturing credits earned are recorded as a reduction to cost of vehicle sales.
Vehicle Operating Lease
Depreciation of operating lease vehicles are classified as cost of vehicle operating lease revenue.
Other
Cost of other revenue includes direct parts, material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including depreciation of tooling costs, shipping and logistic costs. Cost of other revenue also includes costs associated with providing non-warranty after-sales services, and costs for retail merchandise.

Warranties
The Company provides a manufacturer’s warranty on all vehicles it sells and accrues a warranty reserve for warranty coverage, as applicable. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency, and costs of future claims. The Company accrues a warranty reserve for all products sold which includes the Company’s best estimates of the projected costs related to recalls identified and special campaigns to repair or replace items under warranties. The Company reviews the adequacy of warranty reserve on a regular basis. Changes to the Company’s historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The portion of the warranty reserve for costs expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within other current liabilities, while the remaining balance is included within other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 
The Company recognizes recovery from suppliers as an offset to the warranty expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss and in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet when the recovery amounts are contractually agreed with the suppliers.
 During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded supplier recovery of $
50
 million.
109
Income Taxes
The Company utilizes the liability method to account for income taxes, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from the temporary differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the consolidated financial statements, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax amounts are determined by using the tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes will actually be paid, or refunds received, as provided for under currently enacted tax law. 
The Company recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, all available positive and negative evidence are considered, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, 
tax-planning
 strategies, and results of recent operations. If it is determined that deferred tax assets would be realized in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, an adjustment would be made to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.
The Company records uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process which includes (1) determining whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the 
technical merits of the position
, and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the Company recognizes the amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.
The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Accrued interest and penalties are included within other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company issues stock-based compensation awards to employees, officers, directors, and non-employees in the form of stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”). The Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for stock-based awards based on the awards’ fair value on the date of grant. The Company accounts for forfeitures of stock-based awards when they occur. The fair value of RSUs that vest based on service and/or performance conditions is measured using the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant. The fair value of RSUs that vest based on service and market conditions is measured using a Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant. The fair value of stock options that vest based on service condition is measured using the Black-Scholes option pricing model on the date of grant. The Monte Carlo simulation model and the Black-Scholes option pricing model require the input of assumptions, including the fair value of the Company’s common stock, the expected term of the award, the expected volatility of the Company’s common stock, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of the Company’s common stock. 
The assumptions used to determine the fair value of the awards represent management’s best estimates.
 These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment.
The fair value of awards that vest
 based on only continuous service is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. 
The fair value of awards that vest based on performance or market conditions is recognized over the requisite service period using the graded vesting attribution method. Stock-based compensation expense is only recognized for awards with performance conditions once the performance condition becomes probable of being achieved. 
The performance-based RSUs will vest
 based on the actual achievement of corporate performance goals and/or individual performance. 
The 
RSUs with market conditions will vest only if the Company achieves certain market capitalization targets.
Comprehensive Loss
Comprehensive loss is composed of two components: net loss and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) refers to net unrealized gains or losses on investments in available-for sale securities and foreign currency translation adjustments that are recorded as an element of stockholders’ equity and are excluded from the determination of net loss.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses primarily consist of materials, supplies, personnel-related expenses, contractor fees, engineering design and testing expenses, and allocated facilities cost. Substantially all of the Company’s research and development expenses are related to developing new products, related technologies, and services and improving existing products and services. Research and development expenses have been expensed as incurred and included in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

110
Selling, General, and Administrative
Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses for employees involved in general corporate, selling and marketing functions, including executive management and administration, legal, human resources, allocated facilities and real estate, accounting, finance, tax, and information technology.
Advertising 
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
 Advertising costs were $
49.8
 million and $
35.3
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These costs were 
not
 material for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Restructuring
The Company’s restructuring charges primarily consist of severance payments, employee benefits, employee transition and stock-based compensation expenses associated with the management-approved restructuring plan. One-time employee termination benefits are recognized at the time of communication to employees, unless future service is required, in which case the costs are recognized over the future service period. Ongoing employee termination benefits are recognized when payments are probable and amounts are reasonably estimable. Other costs are recognized as incurred.
Commitments and Contingencies 
Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount within a range of loss can be reasonably estimated. When no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the Company accrues for the minimum amount within the range. Legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred.

Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock
Accounting for the redeemable convertible preferred stock requires an evaluation to determine if liability classification is required under ASC 480-10. Liability classification is required for freestanding financial instruments that are (1) subject to an unconditional obligation requiring the issuer to redeem the instrument by transferring assets, such as those that are mandatorily redeemable, (2) instruments other than equity shares that embody an obligation of the issuer to repurchase its equity shares, or (3) certain types of instruments that obligate the issuer to issue a variable number of equity shares. 
Securities that do not meet the scoping criteria to be classified as a liability under ASC 480 are subject to redeemable equity guidance, which prescribes securities that may be subject to redemption upon an event not solely within the Company’s control to be classified as temporary equity. Securities classified in temporary equity are initially measured at the proceeds received, net of issuance costs and excluding the fair value of bifurcated embedded derivatives, if any. Subsequent measurement of the carrying value of the redeemable convertible preferred stock is required as the instrument is probable of becoming redeemable. The Company accretes the redeemable convertible preferred stock to its redemption value. In certain circumstances, the redemption price may vary based on changes in stock price, in which case the Company recognizes changes in the redemption value immediately as they occur and adjust the carrying value of the security to equal the then current maximum redemption value at the end of each reporting period.
Derivative Liabilities 
The Company evaluates all of its financial instruments, including convertible notes and redeemable convertible preferred stock, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. The Company applies significant judgment to identify and evaluate complex terms and conditions in these contracts and agreements to determine whether embedded derivatives exist. Embedded derivatives must be separately measured from the host contracts if all the requirements for bifurcation are met. The assessment of the conditions surrounding the bifurcation of embedded derivatives depends on the nature of the host contract. Bifurcated embedded derivatives are recognized at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss at each reporting period end. Bifurcated embedded derivatives are classified as a separate liability in the consolidated balance sheet.
The Company’s derivative liabilities are related to the conversion features embedded in the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock. See Note 8 “Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock” for more information.

111
Net Loss Per Share
Basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed in conformity with the two-class method required for participating securities. The Company considers all series of its redeemable convertible preferred stock to be participating securities as they are cumulative and participate in common stock dividends on an as-converted basis. The net loss attributable to common stockholders will reflect the remeasurements of the host contracts for the cumulative dividend and mezzanine equity accretions. Under the two-class method, the net loss attributable to common stockholders is not allocated to the redeemable convertible preferred stock as the preferred stockholders do not have a contractual obligation to share in the Company’s losses.
Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive common share equivalents to the extent they are dilutive. Potentially dilutive shares of Private Placement Warrants under treasury stock method are included in the computation of diluted net loss per share when their effect is dilutive. For purposes of this calculation, Private Placement Warrants, stock options outstanding, RSUs outstanding, potential shares issued under ESPP, if-converted common shares from convertible note, if-converted common shares from Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock and if-converted common shares from Series B redeemable convertible preferred stock are considered to be common stock equivalents.
Common Stock Warrants
The Company accounts for warrants for shares of the Company’s common stock that are not indexed to its own stock as liabilities at fair value on the balance sheet. Liability-classified common stock warrants are subject to remeasurement to fair value as of any respective exercise date and as of each subsequent balance sheet date with changes in fair value recorded in the Company’s statement of operations and comprehensive loss. The Company’s privately placed common stock warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) are liability-classified instruments because they are not deemed indexed to the Company’s own common stock.
Government Grants
The Company recognizes government grants once there is reasonable assurance to receive the grants and meet all the conditions specified in the grants. Grants related to income are recorded as deductions to the related expenses for which the grants are intended to compensate. Grants related to fixed assets are recorded as a deduction in calculating the carrying amount of the related assets and are recognized in profit or loss over the life of a depreciable asset through reduced depreciation expense. Grants received in advance of the acquisition or construction of assets are recorded initially in deferred liability and then as a deduction in calculating the carrying amount of the related fixed assets upon acquisition or construction of the assets.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires incremental segment information disclosure on an annual and interim basis. This amendment includes disclosure of significant segment expenses which are regularly provided to the CODM and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss; other segment items by reportable segment and a description of its composition; reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets; additional measures of segment profit or loss if the CODM uses more than one measure of a segment’s profit or loss in assessing segment performance, and the title and position of the entity’s CODM and how the CODM uses the reported measures of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and determining resource allocation. The Company with a single reportable segment is required to provide all the disclosures from this amendment. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning with the Company’s annual financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, and applies to its financial statements for interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted, and should be applied retrospectively. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024. See Note 17 “Segment Reporting” for the required disclosures. 
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires incremental annual income tax disclosures. This amendment includes disclosures of specific categories in the rate reconciliation and additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold; income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign taxes, and also disaggregated by individual jurisdictions that meet a quantitative threshold; income (or loss) from continuing operations before income tax expenses (or benefit) disaggregated between domestic and foreign; and income tax expense (or benefit) from continuing operations disaggregated by federal, state and foreign. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and should be applied prospectively (with retrospective application permitted). The Company is evaluating the impact of this amendment and does not expect a material impact to the related financial statement disclosures. 
112
In March 2024, the SEC issued its final rule that requires certain climate-related disclosures in annual reports, including governance, oversight, and risk management processes on material climate-related risks; material impact of climate risks on the Company’s strategy, business model, and outlook; material climate targets and goals; and material financial statements impacts due to severe weather events and other natural conditions. This SEC rule provides phased effective dates, starting with fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. The SEC rule is currently stayed pending the outcome of litigation, and the Company is evaluating the impact of this rule on its annual reports.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses, which requires disclosure of specified information about certain costs and expenses (such as purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, and amortization) within the relevant expense captions presented on the face of the statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted, and should be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. The Company is evaluating the impact of this amendment to the related financial statement disclosures.
The Company has considered all other recently issued accounting pronouncements and does not believe the adoption of such pronouncements will have a material impact on its financial statements or notes thereto.
NOTE 3 - 
RESTRUCTURING
On May 24, 2024, the Company announced a restructuring plan (the “2024 Restructuring Plan”) intended to optimize operating expenses in response to evolving business needs and productivity improvement through a reduction in workforce.

NOTE 5 - 
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The accounting standard for fair value measurements provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or the “exit price” that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between independent market participants on the measurement date. The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value at each reporting period using a fair value hierarchy, which requires the Company to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A financial instrument classification within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows:
•
Level 1
—Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
•
Level 2
—Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
•
Level 3
—Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Factors used to develop the estimated fair value are unobservable inputs that are not supported by market activity. The sensitivity of the fair value measurement to changes in unobservable inputs may result in a significantly higher or lower measurement.
Cash, cash equivalents and investments are reported at their respective fair values on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s short-term and long-term investments are classified as available-for-sale securities. Carrying amounts of accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other current liabilities approximate their estimated fair values. 
116
The following table sets forth the Company’s financial assets subject to fair value measurements on a recurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

On November 6, 2023, the Company received 
28,352,273
 ordinary shares of Aston Martin with an initial fair value of $
73.2
 million. The Company remeasured the shares and recorded fair values of $
37.8
 million and $
81.5
 million within investments in equity securities of a related party in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These equity securities are publicly traded stocks (where shares are denominated in GBP) measured at fair value on a recurring basis and classified within level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized an unrealized loss of $
43.1
 million and an unrealized gain of $
6.0
 million, respectively, in change of fair value of equity securities of a related party in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company also recognized $
0.6
 million of unrealized foreign currency loss and $
2.3
 million of unrealized foreign currency gain related to these equity securities, respectively, in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. See Note 16 “Related Party Transactions” for more information. 
Level 3 liabilities consist of the common stock warrant liability and the derivative liabilities associated with the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock, of which the fair values were measured upon issuance of the Private Placement Warrants and the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock and are remeasured at each reporting period. The valuation methodology and underlying assumptions are discussed further in Note 7 “Common Stock Warrant Liability” and Note 8 “Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock”, respectively. Level 3 liabilities also consist of residual value guarantee liabilities, of which the fair value is measured initially upon delivery of vehicles and assessed subsequently for any changes on a quarterly basis. Significant changes in the unobservable inputs used in determining the fair value would result in significant changes to the fair value measurement.

NOTE 6 – 
DEBT
2026 Notes 
In December 2021, the Company issued an aggregate of $
2,012.5
 million principal amount of 
1.25
% convertible senior notes due in December 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, at an issuance price equal to 
99.5
% of the principal amount of 2026 Notes. The Company has designated the 2026 Notes as green bonds, whose proceeds will be allocated in accordance with the Company’s green bond framework. The 2026 Notes were issued pursuant to and are governed by an indenture dated December 14, 2021, between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association as the trustee. The proceeds from the issuance of the 2026 Notes were $
1,986.6
 million, net of the issuance discount and debt issuance costs. 
118
The 2026 Notes are unsecured obligations which bear regular interest at 
1.25
% per annum and are payable semiannually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on June 15, 2022. The 2026 Notes will mature on December 15, 2026, unless repurchased, redeemed, or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. The 2026 Notes are convertible into cash, shares of our Class A common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our Class A common stock, at the Company’s election, at an initial conversion rate of 18.2548 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2026 Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $
54.78
 per share of our Class A common stock. The conversion rate is subject to customary adjustments for certain dilutive events. The Company may redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2026 Notes, at the Company’s option, on or after December 20, 2024 if the last reported sale price of our Class A common stock has been at least 
130
% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 
20
 trading days at a redemption price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to the day before the redemption date. The holders may require the Company to repurchase the 2026 Notes upon the occurrence of certain fundamental change transactions at a redemption price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to the day before the redemption date. 
Holders of the 2026 Notes may convert all or a portion of their 2026 Notes at their option prior to September 15, 2026, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, only under the following circumstances:
•
during any calendar quarter commencing after the quarter ended on March 31, 2022 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the Company’s common stock price exceeds 
130
% of the conversion price for at least 
20
 trading days during the 
30
 consecutive trading days at the end of the prior calendar quarter; 
•
during the 
five
 consecutive business days immediately after any 
10
 consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 
98
% of the product of the last reported sale price per share of our common stock on such trading day and the conversion rate on such trading day; 
•
upon the occurrence of specified corporate events; or 
•
if the Company calls any or all 2026 Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date, but only with respect to the notes called for redemption. 
On or after September 15, 2026, the 2026 Notes are convertible at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. Holders of the 2026 Notes who convert the 2026 Notes in connection with a make-whole fundamental change, as defined in the indenture governing the 2026 Notes, or in connection with a redemption may be entitled to an increase in the conversion rate.
The Company accounted for the issuance of the 2026 Notes as a single liability measured at its amortized cost, as no other embedded features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives.

 The Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock ranks senior to the common stock with respect to dividends and distributions of assets upon the Company’s liquidation, dissolution or winding up. The Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock has an initial value of $
10,000

 Upon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, each holder of shares of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock (“Holder”) will be entitled to receive, with respect to each share of then-outstanding Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock, out of the assets of the Company available for distribution to its stockholders an amount in cash equal to the greater of (a) an amount per share of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock as of the date of such liquidation, dissolution or winding up equal to (i) the per share Accrued Value as of the relevant date multiplied by (ii) the relevant percentage (the product of (i) and (ii), the “Minimum Consideration”); and (b) the amount that such Holder would have received with respect to such share of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock if all shares of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock had been converted at their Accrued Value into shares of common stock on the business day immediately prior to the date of such liquidation, dissolution or winding up. As of December 31, 2024, the liquidation preference of the Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock was $
1,138.8
 million and $
800.4
 million, respectively.

Voting Rights: 
Each Holder is entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of whole shares of common stock into which the aggregate shares of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock held by such Holder are convertible on the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote on any matter presented to the stockholders of the Company for their action or consideration at any meeting of stockholders and on which matter holders of the common stock shall be entitled to vote. Holders are entitled to notice of any meeting of stockholders and, except as otherwise provided in the Certificate of Designations or otherwise required by law, to vote together as a single class with the holders of the common stock and any other class or series of stock entitled to vote thereon. The voting power of Holders is subject to a voting cap per share equal to the quotient of the $
10,000
 Initial Value and the minimum price ($
2.77
 for the Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock and $
3.12
 for the Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock).
As long as at least

The Company also agreed that as long as Ayar owns at least

 Each share of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible, at the option of the respective Holder, from time-to-time after the initial issue date, and without the payment of additional consideration by the Holder, (a) at any time that the closing price per share of the common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Holder delivers the relevant notice of conversion is at least $
5.50
 (subject to certain adjustments), unless the Company otherwise consents to such conversion in its sole discretion, or (b) in all events during certain specified periods relating to a fundamental change or optional redemption by the Company, into such number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock as is determined by dividing (i) the applicable Accrued Value as of the conversion date by (ii) the applicable conversion price in effect as of such conversion date, which shall initially be $
3.5952
 for the Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock and $
4.3799
 for the Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, including in the event of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or similar events (the “Conversion Price”). 
Mandatory Conversion: 
On or after the third anniversary of the initial issue date, if at any time (i) the daily VWAP of the common stock has been at least 
200
% of the Conversion Price for at least twenty (
20
) trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any thirty (
30
) consecutive trading days (including the last day of such period) and (ii) certain common stock liquidity conditions are satisfied, the Company will have the right, exercisable at its election within fifteen (
15
) business days following completion of the applicable thirty (
30
) trading day period, to cause all or any portion of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock to convert into number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock, as determined by dividing (i) the applicable Accrued Value as of the conversion date by (ii) the Conversion Price in effect as of such conversion date. The Company will be required to pay an additional amount per share of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock payable in cash, shares of common stock valued based on a 
five-day
 average daily VWAP or a combination thereof in respect of such conversion equal to the greater of (x) the difference between (i) the Minimum Consideration and (ii) the value of the shares of common stock delivered upon mandatory conversion thereof and (y) zero.
Fundamental Change: 
Upon a fundamental change, the Holders will be entitled, on the fundamental change repurchase date specified by the Company, to receive an amount equal to the greater of (a) the Minimum Consideration and (b) an amount equal to the value that such Holder would have received if it had converted its shares of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock into shares of common stock on the business day immediately before the fundamental change repurchase date. The fundamental change repurchase price may be paid in cash, shares of common stock (or other securities to be received by a holder of common stock in such fundamental change) valued based on a 
five-day
 average daily VWAP (with the number of shares of common stock rounded up to the nearest whole share), or a combination thereof, at the Company’s election. The Company may not elect to deliver shares of its common stock (or other securities to be received by a holder of common stock in such fundamental change) in partial or full satisfaction of the fundamental change repurchase price, if certain common stock liquidity conditions are not satisfied. 
Optional Redemption: 
On or after the fifth anniversary of the initial issue date, the Company may redeem all or any portion of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock at a redemption price per share equal to the greater of (a) the Minimum Consideration and (b) an amount equal to the value (calculated based on a twenty (
20
)-day average daily VWAP) of the number of shares of common stock if it had converted its shares of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock into shares of common stock as of the redemption date. Such redemption price may be paid in cash, shares of common stock valued based on a twenty (
20
)-day average daily VWAP, or a combination thereof, at the Company’s election. 
123
The Company may not pay any portion of such redemption price in shares of common stock if the common stock liquidity conditions are not satisfied.
While the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock is callable after 
five years
 at the Company’s option, the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock is considered redeemable at the option of Ayar and was classified as mezzanine equity, because it is the majority shareholder of the Company. The Company recorded the Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock initially at its issuance price, net of issuance costs of $
2.4
 million and net of the initial value of the bifurcated derivative liability of $
497.1
 million. The Company also recorded the Series B Redeemable Convertible Stock initially at its issuance price, net of issuance costs of $
0.6
 million and net of the initial value of the bifurcated derivative liability of $
297.7
 million. 
The Company accretes the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock to its redemption value, which is greater of (a) the Minimum Consideration and (b) an amount equal to the value that such Holder would have received if it had converted its shares of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock into shares of common stock as of the Redemption Date. In certain circumstances, the redemption price may vary based on changes in stock price, in which case the Company recognizes changes in the redemption value immediately as they occur and adjust the carrying value of the security to equal the then current maximum redemption value at the end of each reporting period. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded accretion of $
229.5
 million and $
118.1
 million related to the Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock and the Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock, respectively. Accretion of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock was reflected as adjustments to additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024. The carrying value of the Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock was $
730.0
 million and $
569.8
 million as of December 31, 2024, respectively. 
The Company assessed the above features to determine whether any features are required to be bifurcated and separately accounted for as an embedded feature. The Company concluded that the conversion features, inclusive of all settlement outcomes where the pay-off is indexed to the if-converted value, meets all the requirements to be separately accounted for as a bifurcated derivative. As a result, the Company bifurcated the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock between (i) the host contracts which are accounted for within mezzanine equity as described above, and (ii) the bifurcated derivative liabilities related to the conversion features. The proceeds from issuance were first allocated to the fair value of the bifurcated derivatives with the residual being allocated to the host contracts. The bifurcated derivatives are remeasured to fair value at each reporting period with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensi
ve loss
. 
As of December 31, 2024, the derivative liabilities for the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock were remeasured to fair value of $
639.4
 million, comprising of $
408.8
 million related to Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock and $
230.6
 million related to Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock. The Company recognized gains of $
155.4
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 in change in fair value of derivative liabilities associated with redeemable convertible preferred stock (related party) in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 
The Company estimated the fair value of the derivative liabilities using a binomial lattice model with the volatility, credit spread, and term

as significant unobservable inputs. Assumptions used in the valuation also take into account the contractual terms as well as the quoted price of the Company’s common stock in an active
 market. Significant changes in any of those inputs in isolation would result in significant changes to the fair value measurement.

STOCK-BASED AWARDS
Lucid 2021 Incentive Plan and ESPP
In July 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted and the stockholders approved the 2021 Incentive Plan (the “2021 Incentive Plan”), which includes an ESPP as an addendum. The 2021 Incentive Plan replaced the 2021 Plan. The 2021 Incentive Plan provides for the grant of restricted shares, non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, unrestricted shares, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units and cash awards. Shares of common stock underlying awards that are forfeited or cancelled generally are returned to the pool of shares available for issuance under the 2021 Incentive Plan.

Time-based RSUs granted prior to the closing of merger are subject to both performance-based and service-based vesting conditions. The performance condition was satisfied upon the closing of the merger, and the service condition will be met generally over 
four years
. The Company granted 
13,834,748
 shares of the time-based RSUs to the former CEO that will vest in 
sixteen
 equal quarterly installments, beginning on December 5, 2021, and are subject to continuous employment. The service condition for 
25
% of the Company’s non-CEO RSUs granted prior to the closing of merger was satisfied 
375
 days after the closing. The remaining RSUs will be satisfied in equal quarterly installments thereafter, subject to continuous employment. The Company recognizes compensation expense for these time-based RSUs on a graded vesting schedule over the requisite vesting period. Fair value of these time-based RSUs was measured using the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant, as based on the market price of Churchill’s stock adjusted for the expected exchange ratio at the time, and discounted for lack of marketability.
Time-based RSUs granted subsequent to the closing of merger are only subject to service-based vesting conditions and the compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The fair value of these time-based RSUs granted after the closing of the merger was measured using the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant.
As of December 31, 2024, unrecognized stock-based compensation cost related to outstanding unvested time-based RSUs that are expected to vest was $
331.1
 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 
1.6
 years. The total fair value of time-based RSUs vested during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 was $
140.8
 million, $
121.1
 million, and $
190.9
 million, respectively. 
In 2021, the Company granted performance-based RSUs to the former CEO and they are subject to performance and market conditions. The performance condition was satisfied upon the closing of the merger. The market conditions will be satisfied and vest in 
five
 tranches based on the achievement of market capitalization goals applicable to each tranche over a 
six-month
 period subject to the former CEO’s continuous employment through the applicable vesting date. Any performance-based RSUs granted to our former CEO that have not vested within 
five years
 after the closing will be forfeited. 
The fair value of these performance-based RSUs was measured on the grant date, March 27, 2021, using a Monte Carlo simulation model, with the following assumptions:

The Company recognizes compensation expense using a graded vesting attribution method over the derived service period for the former CEO’s performance-based awards. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized when the relevant performance condition is considered probable of achievement for the performance-based award. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the market condition was met for the performance-based awards of the former CEO for 
four
 of the 
five
 tranches and certified by the Board of Directors, representing an aggregate of 
13,934,271
 performance RSUs. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $
85.4
 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. The unamortized expense of $
8.2
 million as of December 31, 2022 for the fifth tranche, representing 
2,090,140
 RSUs, was fully recognized during the year ended December 31, 2023. There were 
no
 performance-based RSUs vested for our former CEO for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. The total fair value of the former CEO’s performance-based RSUs vested was $
315.3
 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company withheld approximately 
1.9
 million, 
1.9
 million, and 
9.4
 million shares, respectively, of common stock by net settlement to meet the related tax withholding requirements related to the former CEO’s time-based and performance-based RSUs.
127
The Company granted performance-based RSUs to certain employees and they are subject to (i) corporate performance conditions and/or individual performance and (ii) a service condition which will be met generally over 
3
 years. The number of awards granted represents 
100
% of the target goal. Under the terms of the awards, the recipient may earn between 
0
% to 
150
% of the original number of grants based on actual achievement of corporate performance goals and/or individual performance. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized when the relevant performance condition is considered probable of achievement for the performance-based award. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expenses of $
26.1
 million, $
7.9
 million, and 
nil
, respectively, related to these performance-based RSUs. The total fair value of these performance-based RSUs vested during the year ended December 31, 2024 was $
5.3
 million, and 
nil
 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. As of December 31, 2024, the unamortized expense for the performance-based RSUs was $
30.1
 million, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 
1.1
 years primarily contingent upon realization of the corporate performance conditions.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”)
The ESPP authorizes the issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to purchase rights granted to employees. The plan provides for 
24
-month offering periods beginning in December and June of each year, and each offering period will consist of 
four

six-month
 purchase periods. The purchase price for each share purchased during an offering period will be the lesser of 
85
% of the fair market value of the share on the purchase date or 
85
% of the fair market value of the share on the offering date.
If the market value of our common stock on the purchase date is lower than the market value at the beginning of the offering period, the ongoing offering terminates immediately following the purchase of ESPP shares on the purchase date and participants in the terminated offering are automatically enrolled in the new offering resulting in a reset of the offering price and a modification charge to be recognized over the new offering period. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, there were 
two
 ESPP resets that resulted in modification charges of $
17.8
 million, $
23.2
 million, and $
19.9
 million, respectively, which are being recognized until the new offering period ending in November 2026.
The Company issued

NOTE 11 – 
LEASES
The Company has entered into various non-cancellable operating and finance lease agreements for certain of the Company’s offices, manufacturing and warehouse facilities, retail and service locations, equipment and vehicles, worldwide. The Company has determined if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, including embedded leases, at inception and records the leases in the Company’s financial statements upon lease commencement, which is the date when the underlying asset is made available for use by the lessor.
Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Our assessed lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Certain operating leases provide for annual increases to lease payments based on an index or rate. The Company estimates the annual increase in lease payments based on the index or rate at the lease commencement date. Differences between the estimated lease payment and actual payment are expensed as incurred. Lease expense for finance lease payments is recognized as amortization expense of the finance lease ROU asset and interest expense on the finance lease liability over the lease term.
128
In August 2022, the Company entered into a 
four-year
 agreement (“Lease Agreement”) to lease land in Casa Grande, Arizona adjacent to our manufacturing facility. The Company classifies this lease as a finance lease because the Lease Agreement contains a purchase option which the Company is reasonably certain to exercise. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, assets associated with the finance lease were $
79.3
 million. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, liabilities associated with the finance lease were $
80.0
 million and $
80.6
 million, respectively.
Contemporaneously with the execution of the Lease Agreement, the Company entered into a sale agreement, pursuant to which the Company sold certain parcels of land for $
31.7
 million to the lessor and leased back these parcels of land under the Lease Agreement. The sale of the land and subsequent lease did not result in change in the transfer of control of the land; therefore, the sale-leaseback transaction is accounted for as a failed sale and leaseback financing obligation. The Company recorded $
31.7
 million of sales proceeds received as a financial liability within other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Legal Matters
From time-to-time, the Company may become subject to legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Some of these claims, lawsuits and other proceedings may involve highly complex issues that are subject to substantial uncertainties, and could result in damages, fines, penalties, non-monetary sanctions or relief.
Beginning on April 18, 2021, 
two
 individual actions and 
two
 putative class actions were filed in federal courts in Alabama, California, New Jersey and Indiana, asserting claims under the federal securities laws against the Company (f/k/a Churchill Capital Corp IV), its wholly owned subsidiary, Atieva, Inc. (“Lucid Motors”), and certain current and former officers and directors of the Company, generally relating to the Merger. On September 16, 2021, the plaintiff in the New Jersey action voluntarily dismissed that lawsuit. The remaining actions were ultimately transferred to the Northern District of California and consolidated under the caption, 
In re CCIV / Lucid Motors Securities Litigation
, Case No. 4:21-cv-09323-YGR (the “Consolidated Class Action”). On December 30, 2021, lead plaintiffs in the Consolidated Class Action filed a revised amended consolidated complaint (the “Complaint”), which asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of a putative class of shareholders who purchased stock in CCIV between February 5, 2021 and February 22, 2021. The Complaint names as defendants Lucid Motors and the Company’s former chief executive officer, and generally alleges that, prior to the public announcement of the Merger, defendants purportedly made false or misleading statements regarding the expected start of production for the Lucid Air and related matters. The District Court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss on January 11, 2023, with plaintiffs being provided the ability to seek leave to amend. On June 29, 2023, the District Court denied plaintiff’s motion for leave to amend, dismissed the lawsuit and terminated the case. On July 28, 2023, plaintiffs appealed the District Court’s decisions to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. On August 8, 2024, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court judgment dismissing the case. On September 17, 2024, the Ninth Circuit denied Plaintiffs’ petition for a rehearing or rehearing 
en banc
. On September 25, 2024, the Ninth Circuit issued its mandate affirming the district court judgment. Plaintiffs did not appeal the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, and the case is therefore now final and closed.
In addition, 
two
 separate purported shareholders of the Company filed shareholder derivative actions, purportedly on behalf of the Company, against certain of the Company’s officers and directors in California federal court, captioned 
Sahr Lebbie v. Peter Rawlinson, et al.,
 Case No. 4:22-cv-00531-YGR (N.D. Cal.) (filed on January 26, 2022) and 
Zsata Williams-Spinks v. Peter Rawlinson, et al.
, Case No. 4:22-cv-01115-YGR (N.D. Cal.) (filed on February 23, 2022). The complaint also names the Company as a nominal defendant. Based on allegations that are similar to those in the Consolidated Class Action, the Lebbie complaint asserts claims for unjust enrichment, breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, gross mismanagement and waste of corporate assets and a claim for contribution under Sections 10(b) and 21D of the Exchange Act in connection with the Consolidated Class Action and the Williams-Spinks complaint asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty, gross mismanagement, abuse of control, unjust enrichment, contribution under Sections 10(b) and 21D of the Exchange Act, and aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the Consolidated Class Action. The complaints seek compensatory damages, interest thereon, certain corporate governance reforms, and attorneys’ fees and expenses. On April 29, 2022, the District Court consolidated the 
two
 actions into 
In re Lucid Group, Inc. (f/k/a Churchill Capital Corp IV) Derivative Litigation
, Case No. 4:22-cv-00531-YGR (N.D. Cal.) (the “Consolidated Derivative Action”). On May 25, 2022, the District Court then stayed the Consolidated Derivative Action pending developments in the Consolidated Class Action. On December 12, 2023, given that the Consolidated Class Action was dismissed by the trial court and appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, the District Court administratively closed the Consolidated Derivative Action for statistical purposes, but reminded the parties of their obligations under the stay. On January 9, 2025, the parties filed a joint stipulation of dismissal without prejudice with the District Court, and the case is now closed.
131
On April 1, 2022 and May 31, 2022, 
two
 alleged shareholders filed putative class actions under the federal securities laws against Lucid Group, Inc. and certain officers of the Company relating to alleged statements, updated projections and guidance provided in the late 2021 to early 2022 timeframe. The complaints, which were filed in the Northern District of California, are captioned 
Victor W. Mangino v. Lucid Group, Inc., et al.
, Case No. 3:22-cv-02094-JD, and 
Anant Goel v. Lucid Group, Inc., et al.
, Case No. 3:22-cv-03176-JD. The two matters were consolidated into one action, entitled 
In re Lucid Group, Inc. Securities Litigation
, Case No. 22-cv-02094-JD. The consolidated complaint named as defendants Lucid Group, Inc. and the Company’s former chief executive officer and former chief financial officer, and generally alleged that defendants purportedly made false or misleading statements regarding delivery and revenue projections and related matters between November 15, 2021 and August 3, 2022. The consolidated complaint sought certification of the action as a class action, as well as compensatory damages, interest thereon, and attorneys’ fees and expenses. Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss on February 23, 2023. On August 8, 2024, the Court granted in part and denied in part Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, and gave Plaintiffs leave to replead their complaint. On September 20, 2024, Plaintiffs filed an Amended Consolidated Complaint, which no longer names the Company’s former chief financial officer as an individual defendant. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Amended Consolidated Complaint, in part, on December 6, 2024. A hearing on the Motion to Dismiss currently is scheduled for May 1, 2025. Defendants believe that the plaintiffs’ claims are without merit and intend to defend themselves vigorously, but they cannot ensure that their efforts to dismiss partially the consolidated complaint will be successful or that they will ultimately avoid liability in this matter.
In addition, on July 11, 2022, a purported shareholder of the Company filed a shareholder derivative action, purportedly on behalf of the Company against certain of the Company’s officers and directors in California state court, captioned 
Floyd Taylor v. Glenn August, et al.
, Superior Court, Alameda County, Case No. 22CV014130. The complaint also names the Company as a nominal defendant. Based on allegations that are similar to those in the 
In re Lucid Group, Inc. Securities Litigation 
action, the 
Taylor
 complaint asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets and aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty. The complaint seeks compensatory damages, punitive damages, an accounting, interest, and attorneys’ fees and expenses. The case is currently stayed per stipulation of the parties.
In addition, on September 5, 2024, a purported shareholder of the Company filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit purportedly on behalf of the Company against certain of the Company’s current and former directors in Delaware state court, captioned 
Tricia Rodney v. Rawlinson, et al.
, Delaware Court of Chancery, Case No. 2024-0927. The complaint also names the Company as a nominal defendant. The complaint alleges: (i) a breach of fiduciary duty claim against the Company’s former CEO; (ii) a breach of fiduciary duty claim against other then-current members of the Board in 2022; and (iii) an unjust enrichment claim against the Company’s former CEO.
On November 8, 2024, another purported shareholder of the Company filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit purportedly on behalf of the Company against certain of the Company’s current and former directors in Delaware state court, captioned 
Ed Lomont v. Rawlinson, et al.
, Delaware Court of Chancery, Case No. 2024-1149. The complaint also names the Company as a nominal defendant. The complaint alleges claims similar to the 
Rodney 
shareholder derivative action and is premised on the same underlying allegations as those in the 
In re Lucid Group, Inc. Securities Litigation 
action. On January 28, 2025, the Court consolidated the 
Rodney 
and 
Lomont 
actions into 
In re Lucid Group, Inc. Stockholder Derivative Litigation
, Delaware Court of Chancery, Consolidated Case No. 2024-0927. The consolidated action is currently stayed per stipulation of the parties.
On December 3, 2024, another purported shareholder of the Company filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit purportedly on behalf of the Company against certain of the Company’s current and former directors in Delaware state court, captioned 
May Vang and Mohammed Khalid v. Rawlinson, et al.
, Delaware Court of Chancery, Case No. 2024-1243. The complaint also names the Company as a nominal defendant. The complaint asserts claims similar to the 
Taylor 
shareholder derivative action and is premised on the same underlying allegations as those in the 
In re Lucid Group, Inc. Securities Litigation 
action. The case is currently stayed per stipulation of the parties.
On January 29, 2025, another purported shareholder of the Company filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit purportedly on behalf of the Company against certain of the Company’s current and former directors in California federal court, captioned 
Zalmon Uvaydov

v. Rawlinson, et al.
, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, Case No.: 3:25-cv-943. The complaint asserts claims similar to the 
Taylor 
shareholder derivative action, as well as a contribution claim under Section 21(D) of the Securities Exchange Act against the Company’s former CEO, and is premised on the same underlying allegations as those in the 
In re Lucid Group, Inc. Securities Litigation 
action. 
On February 7, 2025, another purported shareholder of the Company filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit purportedly on behalf of the Company against certain of the Company’s current and former directors in California federal court, captioned 
Neil Cook v. Rawlinson, et al.
, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, Case No.: 3:25-cv-01346. The complaint asserts claims similar to the 
Taylor
 shareholder derivative action, as well as a Section 14(a) claim, and is premised on the same underlying allegations as those in the 
In re Lucid Group, Inc. Securities Litigation
 action.
132
Moreover, on March 25, 2021, the Illinois Automobile Dealers Association, Chicago Automobile Trade Association, Peoria Metro New Car Dealers Association, Illinois Motorcycle Dealers Association, and 241 individual motor vehicle dealers filed an action against the Office of the Illinois Secretary of State (“SOS”), Jesse White, in his official capacity as the Illinois Secretary of State; Lucid USA, Inc. (“Lucid USA”); and other defendants, in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, County Department, Chancery Division, Case No. 2021CH01438. The suit generally alleges that Illinois law does not permit manufacturers to obtain licenses as motor vehicle dealers. Plaintiffs seek to prevent Lucid from engaging in the sale of motor vehicles directly to consumers. The SOS granted Lucid USA a dealer’s license on June 3, 2021. In December 2022, the Court granted Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss. Plaintiffs subsequently appealed and the decision was affirmed by the First District Appellate Court on August 23, 2024. Plaintiffs filed a petition for further review of the case by the Illinois Supreme Court and the Illinois Supreme Court denied review. 
Furthermore, while we have registered and applied for trademarks in an effort to protect our brand and goodwill with customers, competitors or other third parties are, have in the past, and may in the future, oppose our trademark applications or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks and other brand names in which we have invested. Such oppositions and challenges can be expensive and may adversely affect our ability to maintain the goodwill gained in connection with a particular trademark. In addition, we may lose our trademark or are unable to submit specimens of use by the applicable deadline to perfect such trademark rights. For instance, in June 2024, we reached an agreement with Gravity, Inc. to settle a claim before the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) that opposed and requested cancellation of our trademark application and registration for the use of “Gravity.”
At this time, the Company does not consider any such claims, lawsuits or proceedings that are currently pending, individually or in the aggregate, including the matters referenced above, to be material to the Company’s business or likely to result in a material adverse effect on its future operating results, financial condition or cash flows should such proceedings be resolved unfavorably.
Indemnification
In the ordinary course of business, the Company may provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to customers, vendors, investors, directors, officers, and certain key employees with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of our breach of such agreements, services to be provided by the Company, or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. These indemnification provisions may survive termination of the underlying agreement and the maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification provisions may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is indeterminable. The Company has never paid a material claim, nor has it been sued in connection with these indemnification arrangements. The Company has indemnification obligations with respect to letters of credit and surety bond primarily used as security against facility leases, utilities infrastructure and other agreements that require securitization. The indemnification obligations were $
72.6
 million and $
56.3
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, for which no liabilities are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets.

The Company does not anticipate foreign earnings would be subject to U.S. taxation upon repatriation. However, distributions of unremitted foreign earnings may be subject to foreign withholding taxes. Accordingly, provisions have not been made on the Company’s basis differences in investments that primarily result from earnings in foreign subsidiaries which are indefinitely reinvested. If recorded, the deferred tax liability associated with indefinitely reinvested basis differences would be immaterial to the financial statements. 
A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized in a particular tax jurisdiction. All available evidence, both positive and negative, is considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed for some portion or all of a deferred tax asset. Judgment must be used in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence. Based on the weight of the available evidence, which includes the Company’s historical operating losses, lack of taxable income, and the accumulated deficit, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company provided a full valuation allowance against its U.S. and state deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was $
2,904.9
 million and $
2,137.9
 million, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The valuation allowance on our net deferred taxes increased by $
767.0
 million and $
763.6
 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The Company had federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $
5,766.1
 million, $
5,142.4
 million, and $
19.1
 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2024, which will begin to expire at various dates beginning in 2027. The Company also had federal and state tax research and development tax credit carryforwards of $
151.8
 million and $
78.6
 million, respectively. The federal research and development tax credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in 2036, if not utilized. The state research and development tax credit carryforwards do not expire. 
The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, imposes restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses and certain credits in the event of an “ownership change” of a corporation. Accordingly, a company’s ability to use net operating losses and certain credits may be limited as prescribed under. 
Internal Revenue Code Section 382, which provide for limitations on net operating losses carryforwards and certain built in losses following ownership changes, and Section 383, which provides for special limitations on certain excess credits, etc. (collectively, “IRC Section 382”). Utilization of the carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the IRC Section 382 and similar state provisions, resulting in a reduction in the gross deferral tax assets before considering the valuation allowance. The Company has completed a formal Section 382 study of our equity transactions through December 31, 2020. The study determined that the Company experienced an “ownership change” in 2016, and the Company will not be able to utilize $
12.0
 million of our U.S. federal net operating loss and $
3.0
 million of U.S. federal research and development tax credit carryforwards.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Based on their evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to, and are effective to, provide reasonable assurance that the information we are required to disclose in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”).
Our management, under the supervision of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by 
KPMG LLP
, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
