Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, filed with the SEC on March 22, 2024.
Cash and cash equivalents overview
Our principal sources of liquidity are our current cash and cash equivalents balances, collections from our custodial, service, and interchange revenue activities, and availability under our Revolving Credit Facility. We rely on cash provided by operating activities to meet our short-term liquidity requirements, which primarily relate to the payment of corporate payroll and other operating costs, interest payments on our long-term debt, and capital expenditures.
As of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were $295.9 million and $404.0 million, respectively.

Capital resources
We maintain a “shelf” registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the SEC. A shelf registration statement, which includes a base prospectus, allows us at any time to offer any combination of securities described in the prospectus in one or more offerings. Unless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement accompanying the base prospectus, we would use the net proceeds from the sale of any securities offered pursuant to the shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, working capital, sales and marketing activities, general and administrative matters, capital expenditures, and repayment of indebtedness, and if opportunities arise, for the acquisition of, or investment in, assets, technologies, solutions or businesses that complement our business. Pending such uses, we may invest the net proceeds in interest-bearing securities. In addition, we may conduct concurrent or other financings at any time.
On August 23, 2024, we entered into the Credit Agreement, which includes a five-year senior secured Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.0 billion, a portion of which was used to refinance our Prior Credit Agreement. The Revolving Credit Facility may be used in the future for working capital and general corporate purposes, including the financing of acquisitions and other investments. For a description of the terms of the Credit Agreement, refer to Note 7—Indebtedness to our financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of January 31, 2025, the outstanding balance under the Revolving Credit Facility was $461.9 million. We were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement as of January 31, 2025, and for the period then ended.
Use of cash
During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, we used $452.2 million of cash, which includes $225.0 million borrowed under our prior revolving credit facility, to pay for the BenefitWallet HSA portfolio acquisition.
In August 2024, in connection with our entry into the Credit Agreement, we repaid all outstanding obligations in the amount of $511.9 million under the Prior Credit Agreement and terminated all commitments thereunder. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, we prepaid $50.0 million under the Credit Agreement.
During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, we used $121.5 million of cash for common stock repurchases. See Note 10—Stockholders' equity to our financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our stock repurchase program.
Capital expenditures for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025 and 2024 were $53.2 million and $42.8 million, respectively. We expect to continue our current level of capital expenditures during the fiscal year ending January 31, 2026 as we continue to invest in improving the architecture and functionality of our proprietary systems. Capital expenditures to improve the architecture of our proprietary systems include computer hardware, personnel and related costs for software engineering, and outsourced software engineering services.
We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, and Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. To the extent these current and anticipated future sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our future business activities and requirements, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required, we may not be able to raise it on favorable terms, if at all.
The following table shows our cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities for the stated periods:

Cash flows from operating activities.     
Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $97.0 million, primarily due to increased cash receipts with respect to our custodial, service, and interchange revenues and a decrease in income tax payments, partially offset by an increase in cash payments with respect to operating expenses, cost of revenue, and interest on our long-term debt.
-43-
Table of Contents
Cash flows from investing activities.     
Net cash used in investing activities increased by $459.4 million, primarily due to a $449.0 million increase in cash used to acquire HSA portfolios and a $10.0 million increase in cash used for purchases of software and capitalized software development costs.
Cash flows from financing activities.     
Net cash provided by financing activities was $57.6 million during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, compared to $47.0 million of net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024. The change was due to a $736.9 million increase in proceeds from long-term debt and a $3.0 million increase in proceeds from the exercise of common stock options, partially offset by a $511.2 million increase in cash used for principal payments and debt issuance costs associated with our long-term debt, a $121.5 million increase in cash used for repurchases of common stock, and a $2.5 million increase in net cash used in the settlement of client-held funds obligations.
Contractual obligations
See Note 6—Commitments and contingencies to our financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information about our contractual obligations.
Off-balance sheet arrangements
As of January 31, 2025, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.
Critical accounting policies and significant management estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable in the circumstances. In many instances, we could have reasonably used different accounting estimates, and in other instances, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected.
In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management’s judgment in its application, while in other cases, management’s judgment is required in selecting among available alternative accounting standards that allow different accounting treatment for similar transactions. We believe that there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding our business and prospects for future performance, as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and other significant areas that involve management’s judgment and estimates. These significant policies and our procedures related to these policies are described in detail below.
Capitalized software development costs
We account for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 350-40, 
Internal-Use Software
. Costs incurred during operation and post-implementation stages are charged to expense. Costs incurred that are directly attributable to developing or obtaining software for internal use incurred in the application development stage are capitalized. Management’s judgment is required in determining the point when various projects enter the stages at which costs may be capitalized, in assessing the ongoing value of the capitalized costs and in determining the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized.
Valuation of goodwill and other long-lived assets
We review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our single reporting unit below its carrying value. The Company’s annual goodwill impairment test resulted in no impairment charges in any of the periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Long-lived assets, including property and equipment and intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying 
-44-
Table of Contents
amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and eventual disposition. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. We have not recorded any significant impairment charges during the years presented.
Recent accounting pronouncements
See Note 1—Summary of business and significant accounting policies within the financial statements included in this Form 10-K for further discussion.
Item 7A. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk
Market risk
Concentration of market risk.     
We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from providing services to tax-advantaged healthcare account holders. A significant downturn in this market or changes in state and/or federal laws impacting the preferential tax treatment of healthcare accounts such as HSAs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. During the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, no customer accounted for greater than 10% of our total revenue. We monitor market and regulatory changes regularly and make adjustments to our business if necessary. 
Inflation.     
Inflationary factors may adversely affect our operating results. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of expenses as a percentage of revenue if our revenue does not correspondingly increase with inflation.
Concentration of credit risk
Financial instruments, which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. We maintain our cash and cash equivalents in bank and other depository accounts, which frequently exceed federally insured limits. Our cash and cash equivalents as of January 31, 2025 and 2024 were $295.9 million and $404.0 million, respectively, the vast majority of which was not covered by federal depository insurance. We have not experienced any material losses in such accounts. Our accounts receivable balance as of January 31, 2025 and 2024 was $118.0 million and $104.9 million, respectively. We have not experienced any significant write-offs to our accounts receivable and believe that we are not exposed to significant credit risk with respect to our accounts receivable. We continue to monitor our credit risk and place our cash and cash equivalents with reputable financial institutions. 
Interest rate risk
HSA Assets and Client-held funds.

HSA Assets consist of custodial HSA funds we hold in custody on behalf of our members. As of January 31, 2025 and 2024, we held in custody HSA Assets of $32.1 billion and $25.2 billion, respectively. As a non-bank custodian, we contract with our Depository Partners and insurance company partners to hold HSA cash on behalf of our members, and we earn a significant portion of our total revenue from interest paid to us by these partners. HSA cash held by our insurance company partners is held in group annuity contracts or similar arrangements. The lengths of our agreements with Depository Partners typically range from three to five years and have either fixed or variable interest rates. 
As HSA Assets increase and existing contracts with Depository Partners expire, we seek to enter into new contracts with Depository Partners and insurance company partners, the terms of which are impacted by the then-prevailing interest rate environment. We believe that increased participation in our Enhanced Rates offering, diversification of Depository Partners and insurance company partners, and varied contract terms, substantially reduces our exposure to short-term fluctuations in prevailing interest rates and mitigates the short-term impact of a sustained increase or decline in prevailing interest rates on our custodial revenue. 
A sustained decline in prevailing interest rates may negatively affect our business by reducing the size of the interest rate yield, or yield, available to us and thus the amount of the custodial revenue we can realize. Conversely, a sustained increase in prevailing interest rates can increase our yield. An increase in our yield would increase our custodial revenue as a percentage of total revenue. In addition, if our yield increases, we expect the spread to also increase between the interest offered to us by our Depository Partners and insurance company partners and the interest retained by our members, thus increasing our profitability. However, we may be required to increase the interest retained by our members in a rising prevailing interest rate environment. Changes in prevailing interest rates are driven by macroeconomic trends and government policies over which we have no control.
-45-
Table of Contents
Client-held funds are interest earning deposits from which we generate custodial revenue. As of January 31, 2025 and 2024, we held Client-held funds of $896 million and $842 million, respectively. These deposits are amounts remitted by Clients and held by us on their behalf to pre-fund and facilitate administration of our other CDBs. These deposits are held with Depository Partners. We deposit the Client-held funds with our Depository Partners in interest-bearing demand deposit accounts that have a floating interest rate and no set term or duration. A sustained decline in prevailing interest rates may negatively affect our business by reducing the size of the yield available to us and thus the amount of the custodial revenue we can realize from Client-held funds. Conversely, a sustained increase in prevailing interest rates may increase our yield. Changes in prevailing interest rates are driven by macroeconomic trends and government policies over which we have no control.
Cash and cash equivalents
.    
We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be unrestricted cash equivalents. Our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents are held in institutions in the U.S. and include deposits in a money market account that is unrestricted as to withdrawal or use. As of January 31, 2025 and 2024, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $295.9 million and $404.0 million, respectively. Due to the short-term nature of these instruments, we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents as a result of changes in interest rates.
Long-term debt.     
As of January 31, 2025 and 2024, we had $461.9 million and $286.9 million, respectively, outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility and our Prior Credit Facilities, respectively. The stated interest rate on our Revolving Credit Facility is variable and was 5.91% as of January 31, 2025. Our overall interest rate sensitivity under the Revolving Credit Facility is primarily influenced by any amounts borrowed and prevailing interest rates. For example, a one percent increase in the interest rate on the amount outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility as of January 31, 2025 would result in approximately $4.7 million of additional interest expense over the next 12 months. The interest rate on our $600 million of unsecured Senior Notes due 2029 is fixed at 4.50%.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of HealthEquity, Inc.
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of HealthEquity, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of January 31, 2025 and 2024, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), of stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2025, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 31, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2025 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may 
-48-
Table of Contents
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Service Revenue Recognition
As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's primary sources of revenue are service, custodial, and interchange revenue. The Company’s service revenue was $478.3 million for the year ended January 31, 2025. To generate service revenue, the Company administers its platforms, prepares statements, provides a mechanism for spending funds, and provides customer support services. In addition, once a member’s HSA cash balance reaches a certain threshold, the member is able to invest his or her HSA assets through the Company's investment partner from which the Company earns recordkeeping fees, calculated as a percentage of the member's HSA investments. All of these services are consumed as they are received. The Company recognizes service revenue, in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services, on a monthly basis as it satisfies its performance obligations.  
The principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to service revenue recognition is a critical audit matter is a high degree of auditor effort in performing procedures related to the Company’s revenue recognition. 
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process for service revenue. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating the recognition of service revenue for a sample of revenue transactions by obtaining confirmation from customers or obtaining and inspecting source documents, including invoices, sales contracts, and cash receipts.

HealthEquity, Inc. and subsidiaries
Notes to consolidated financial statements
Note 1. 
Summary of business and significant accounting policies
Business
HealthEquity, Inc. ("HealthEquity" or the "Company") was incorporated in the state of Delaware on September 18, 2002. HealthEquity is a leader in administering health savings accounts (“HSAs”) and complementary consumer-directed benefits (“CDBs”), which empower consumers to access tax-advantaged healthcare savings while also providing corporate tax advantages for employers.
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. The financial statements and notes are representations of the Company's management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
Principles of consolidation
The Company consolidates entities in which the Company has a controlling financial interest, which includes all of its wholly owned direct and indirect subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Segments
The Company is managed as a single operating segment that provides administration services in connection with HSAs and other CDBs, which reflects the way in which its chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), the Chief Executive Officer, reviews the Company's financial performance and makes decisions about resource allocation. The CODM assesses the performance of the Company, monitors actual financial results against budgets, and makes resource allocation decisions with a focus on the Company’s consolidated results as presented in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). The Company’s measure of profitability is net income (loss). Single segment-level financial information, including total assets, significant non-cash transactions, and capital expenditures, is contained in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes.
The Company does not generate material international revenues. All long-lived assets are maintained in the United States of America.
Cash and cash equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company’s cash and cash equivalents were held in institutions in the U.S. and include deposits in a money market account that was unrestricted as to withdrawal or use.

Client-held funds
Many of the Company's client services agreements with employers (referred to as "Clients") provide that Clients remit funds to the Company to pre-fund Client and employee participant contributions related to flexible spending accounts and health reimbursement arrangements (“FSAs” and “HRAs,” respectively) and commuter accounts. These Client-held funds remitted to the Company do not represent cash assets of the Company to the extent that they are not combined with corporate cash and accordingly are not included in cash and cash equivalents on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.
Accounts receivable
Accounts receivable represent monies due to the Company for monthly service revenue, custodial revenue and interchange revenue. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for expected credit losses from trade receivables considering past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. In evaluating the Company’s ability to collect outstanding receivable balances, the Company considers various factors including macroeconomic variables, the age of the balance, the creditworthiness of the customer, which is assessed based on ongoing credit evaluations and payment history, and the customer’s current financial condition.
-55-
Table of Contents
Other assets
Other assets consist primarily of contract costs, prepaid expenditures, debt issuance costs, income tax receivables, and various other assets. Amounts expected to be recouped or recognized over a period of twelve months or less have been classified as current in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Leases
The Company determines if a contract contains a lease at inception or any modification of the contract. A contract contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a specified period in exchange for consideration. Control over the use of the identified asset means the lessee has both (a) the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset and (b) the right to direct the use of the asset.
Leases with an expected term of 12 months or less at commencement are not accounted for on the balance sheet. All operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term. Certain leases also include obligations to pay for non-lease services, such as utilities and common area maintenance. The services are accounted for separately from lease components, and the Company allocates payments to the lease and other services components based on estimated stand-alone prices. 
Operating lease right-of-use ("ROU") assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future minimum lease payments over the expected lease term at commencement date. As the rate implicit in each lease is not readily determinable, management uses the Company’s incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of future payments.
Property and equipment
Property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is determined using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of individual assets. The useful life for leasehold improvements is the shorter of the estimated useful life or the term of the lease ranging from 
3
-
5
 years. 
The useful life used for computing depreciation for all other asset classes is described below:
Computer equipment
3
-
5
 years
Furniture and fixtures
5
 years
Maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred, and improvements that extend the economic useful life of an asset are capitalized. Gains and losses on the disposal of property and equipment are reflected in operating expenses.
Intangible assets, net
Intangible assets are carried at cost and amortized, typically, on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. 
The useful life used for computing amortization for all intangible asset classes is described below:
Software and software development costs
3
 years
Acquired customer relationships
7
-
15
 years
Acquired developed technology
2
-
5
 years
Acquired trade names and trademarks
3
 years
Acquired HSA portfolios
15
 years
The Company accounts for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 350-40, 
Internal-Use Software
. Costs incurred during operation and post-implementation stages are charged to expense. Costs incurred during the application development stage that are directly attributable to developing or obtaining software for internal use are capitalized. Management’s judgment is required in determining the point when various projects enter the stages at which costs may be capitalized, in assessing the ongoing value of the capitalized costs and in determining the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized.
Acquired customer relationships, developed technology, and trade names and trademarks are valued utilizing the discounted cash flow method, a form of the income approach. The useful lives of acquired customer relationships were estimated based on discount rates and revenue growth rates, net of attrition. The useful lives of developed technology and trade names were estimated based on expected obsolescence. The Company expenses the assets straight-line over the useful lives and determined that this amortization method is appropriate to reflect the pattern over which the economic benefits of these acquired assets are realized. 
-56-
Table of Contents
Acquired HSA portfolios consist of the contractual rights to administer the activities related to the individual HSAs acquired. The Company used its HSA customer relationship period assumption and the historical attrition rates of member accounts to determine that an average useful life of 
15
 years and the use of a straight-line amortization method are appropriate to reflect the pattern over which the economic benefits of existing member assets are realized. 
The Company reviews identifiable amortizable intangible assets to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated undiscounted cash flows resulting from use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value.

Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually on January 31 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. The Company’s impairment tests are based on a single operating segment and reporting unit structure. The goodwill impairment test involves a qualitative assessment to compare a reporting unit's fair value to its carrying value. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value, a quantitative comparison is made between the Company's market capitalization and the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value.
Self-insurance
The Company is self-insured for medical insurance up to certain annual stop-loss limits. The Company establishes a liability as of the balance sheet date for claims, both reported and incurred but not reported, using currently available information as well as historical claims experience.

Other long-term liabilities
Other long-term liabilities consists of long-term deferred revenue and other liabilities that the Company does not expect to settle within one year.

Revenue recognition
The Company recognizes revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to its customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:
•
identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;
•
identification of the performance obligations in the contract;
•
determination of the transaction price;
•
allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and 
•
recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation.
Disaggregation of revenue.

The Company's primary sources of revenue are service, custodial, and interchange revenue and are disclosed in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). All of the Company's sources of revenue are deemed to be revenue contracts with customers. Each revenue source is affected differently by economic factors as it relates to the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty. 
Costs to obtain a contract.

ASC 606, 
Revenue from contracts with customers
, requires capitalizing the costs of obtaining a contract when those costs are expected to be recovered. 
In order to determine the amortization period for sales commissions contract costs, the Company applied the portfolio approach. Accordingly, the amortization period of the assets has been determined to be the average economic life of an HSA or other CDB relationship, which is estimated to be 
15
 years and 
7
 years, respectively. Amortization of capitalized sales commission contract costs is included in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). The Company has applied the practical expedient which allows an entity to account for incremental costs of obtaining a contract at a portfolio level. The Company has also applied the practical expedient to recognize incremental costs of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred if the amortization period would have been one year or less.
-57-
Table of Contents
Performance obligations.

ASC 606 requires disclosure of the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations; however, as permitted by ASC 606, the Company has elected to exclude from this disclosure any contracts with an original duration of one year or less and any variable consideration that meets specified criteria.
Service revenue.     
The Company administers its platforms, prepares statements, provides a mechanism for spending funds, and provides customer support services. In addition, once a member’s HSA cash balance reaches a certain threshold, the member is able to invest his or her HSA assets through the Company's investment partner from which the Company earns recordkeeping and advisory fees, calculated as a percentage of the member's HSA investments. All of these services are consumed as they are received. The Company recognizes service revenue, in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services, on a monthly basis as it satisfies its performance obligations. 
Custodial revenue.     
The Company earns custodial revenue primarily from HSA assets deposited with depository partners or placed in group annuity contracts or similar arrangements with insurance company partners and Client-held funds deposited with depository partners. The placement of funds represents a service that is simultaneously received and consumed by the depository partners and insurance company partners. The Company recognizes custodial revenue each month, in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to be entitled to in exchange for the service.
Interchange revenue.     
The Company satisfies its interchange performance obligation each time payments are made with its cards via payment networks. The Company recognizes interchange revenue, in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to be entitled to in exchange for the service, in the month the payment transaction occurs. 
Contract balances.     
The Company does not recognize revenue until its right to consideration is unconditional and therefore has no related contract assets. The Company records a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to payment and the Company has unconditional right to payment. Alternatively, when payment precedes the related services, the Company records a contract liability, or deferred revenue, until its performance obligations are satisfied.
Significant judgments. 

The Company makes no significant judgments in determining the amount or timing of revenue recognition. The Company has estimated the average economic life of an HSA or CDB customer relationship, which has been determined to be the amortization period for capitalized sales commissions and other contract costs. 
Cost of revenue
The Company incurs cost of revenue related to servicing member accounts, managing customer and partner relationships, and processing reimbursement claims. Expenditures include personnel-related costs, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, common expense allocations, new member and participant supplies, and other operating costs of the member account servicing departments. Other components of the Company’s cost of revenue include interest retained by members on custodial assets held and interchange costs incurred in connection with processing card transactions initiated by members.
Stock-based compensation
The Company grants restricted stock units ("RSUs") to certain team members, executive officers, and directors. Historically, the Company also granted stock options and restricted stock awards ("RSAs"). The Company recognizes compensation expense for stock-based awards based on the grant date estimated fair value. Expense for stock-based awards is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period and is reversed as pre-vesting forfeitures occur. The fair value of RSUs is based on the current value of the Company's closing stock price on the date of grant less the present value of future expected dividends discounted at the risk-free interest rate. 
For stock-based awards with performance conditions, the Company evaluates the probability of achieving the performance criteria and of the number of shares that are expected to vest, and compensation expense is then adjusted to reflect the number of shares expected to vest and recorded over the requisite service period. For awards with performance conditions, compensation expense is recognized using the graded-vesting attribution method in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718, 
Compensation—Stock Compensation
 ("Topic 718"). Compensation expense related to stock-based awards with market conditions is recorded on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied.
-58-
Table of Contents
Upon the exercise of a stock option or release of an RSU, common shares are issued from authorized, but not outstanding, common stock.
Interest expense
Interest expense consists primarily of accrued interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs associated with the Company's long-term debt.
Other income, net
Other income, net, consists of interest income earned on corporate cash and other miscellaneous income and expense.
Income tax provision (benefit)
The Company accounts for income taxes and the related accounts under the asset and liability method as set forth in ASC 740, 
Income Taxes
. Under this method, current tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on the tax returns for the current fiscal year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, for net operating losses, and for tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted statutory tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of changes in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided for when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets may not be realized in future years. 
The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return using a two-step approach. The first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. For tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, the second step is to measure the tax benefit in the financial statements as the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being sustained upon settlement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Changes in facts and circumstances could have a material impact on the Company’s effective tax rate and results of operations.
Asset acquisitions
The Company routinely acquires rights to be the custodian of HSA portfolios, in which substantially all of the fair value of the gross portfolio assets acquired is concentrated in a group of similar HSA assets and therefore the acquisitions do not constitute a business. Accordingly, the acquisitions are accounted for under the asset acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805-50, 
Business Combinations—Related Issues
. Under the asset acquisition method of accounting, the Company is required to fair value the assets transferred. The cost of the assets acquired, including transaction costs incurred in conjunction with an asset acquisition, is allocated to the individual assets acquired based on their relative fair values and does not give rise to goodwill.
Business combinations
Consideration paid for the acquisition of a business as defined by ASC 805-10 is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of the acquisition date.
Acquisition-related expenses incurred in conjunction with the acquisition of a business are recognized in earnings in the period in which they are incurred and are included in other income, net on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management has made estimates for the allowance for doubtful accounts, capitalized software development costs, evaluating goodwill and long-lived assets for impairment, useful lives of property and equipment and intangible assets, accrued compensation, accrued liabilities, grant date fair value of performance restricted stock units, and income taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Recently adopted accounting pronouncements
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
. The ASU expands public entities’ segment disclosures by requiring disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the CODM and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, an amount and description of other segment items, interim disclosure of a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets, the title and position of the CODM, and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The ASU requires public companies with a single reportable segment to provide the segment disclosures required by Topic 280. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements or disclosures given our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) already include disclosure of our significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to our CODM.
Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
, which improves the transparency of income tax disclosures by requiring consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. It also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. This guidance will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption, the guidance can be applied prospectively or retrospectively. We are currently evaluating the ASU to determine its impact on our income tax disclosures; however, the impact is not expected to be material.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, 
Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
. The ASU requires disaggregated information about certain income statement expense line items on an annual and interim basis. This guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. The new standard permits early adoption and can be applied prospectively or retrospectively. We are evaluating the effect that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

17.1
 million and $
6.2
 million, respectively. The balance as of January 31, 2025 relates primarily to a contract with a depository partner, which the Company assumed in conjunction with the BenefitWallet HSA portfolio acquisition, as described in Note 5—Intangible assets and goodwill.

 million of transaction costs associated with the acquisition during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, which includes the reimbursement of $
20.0
 million of Conduent's transfer-related expenses. In addition, in May 2024, the Company assumed a contract with a depository partner representing approximately 
7
% of the total HSA Assets added through the acquisition, which provides a custodial yield that is below current market rates and expires in June 2026. The Company recorded deferred revenue of $
20.3
 million in May 2024 as a result of the assumed contract, which will be recorded as an increase to custodial revenue over the life of the assumed contract.

The Company leases office space and data storage facilities and has other non-cancelable operating leases expiring at various dates through 2030. These amounts exclude contractual sublease income of $
17.6
 million, which is expected to be received through December 2030.
(4)
Other contractual obligations consist of processing services agreements, software subscriptions, and other contractual commitments.
Contingencies
In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties and provide for general indemnifications. The Company’s exposure under these agreements is unknown because it involves claims that may be made against the Company in the future but have not yet been made. The Company accrues a liability for such matters when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated.
Legal matters
In April 2021, WageWorks, Inc. ("WageWorks"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, exercised its right to terminate a lease for office space in Mesa, Arizona that had not yet commenced, with aggregate lease payments of $
63.1
 million and a term of approximately 
11
 years, following the landlord's failure to fulfill its obligations under the lease agreement (the "Lease"). WageWorks' right to terminate the Lease was disputed by the landlord, Union Mesa 1, LLC (“Union Mesa”), which claimed that the Lease had commenced on December 1, 2020. On November 5, 2021, Union Mesa notified WageWorks that it was in default of the Lease for failure to pay rent, which Union Mesa claimed was due beginning in November 2021, after 
11
 months of abated rent. On November 24, 2021, Union Mesa 
-64-
Table of Contents
drew $
2.8
 million, the full amount under the letter of credit that WageWorks had posted to secure its obligations under the Lease.
On December 1, 2021, WageWorks filed a lawsuit against Union Mesa in the Maricopa County Superior Court in the State of Arizona. On January 4, 2022, WageWorks filed an amended complaint, seeking a declaratory judgment that the Lease was properly terminated and recourse against Union Mesa for breach of contract, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, and conversion, including return of the funds drawn under the letter of credit. On November 27, 2024, the parties agreed to settle the lawsuit, with Union Mesa retaining the $
2.8
 million from the letter of credit and HealthEquity and WageWorks agreeing to pay an additional $
30.0
 million to Union Mesa. The $
30.0
 million settlement amount was recorded as merger integration expense and paid during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025. The $
2.8
 million letter of credit was previously recorded as merger integration expense during the period in which it was drawn by Union Mesa.
As a result of a cybersecurity incident earlier in 2024 in which a business partner's user account containing personally identifiable information was breached, the Company is subject to multiple legal actions, including a consolidated putative class action lawsuit in federal court in the District of Utah, an individual lawsuit filed in Florida state court, and a mass arbitration action. The plaintiffs in these legal actions allege that the Company failed to implement reasonable data security practices, which resulted in a breach and disclosure of plaintiffs' and others' personally identifiable information and protected health information. The plaintiffs are seeking, among other damages, unspecified monetary damages, equitable relief, costs and attorneys' fees arising out of the incident. With respect to the consolidated putative class action lawsuit, on August 22, 2024, the court issued an order granting a motion to consolidate the class action lawsuits, on October 15, 2024, a consolidated class action amended complaint was filed, and on December 13, 2024, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the class action and a motion to compel arbitration. The Company intends to vigorously defend these legal actions. In addition, the Company is subject to several regulatory inquiries related to the cybersecurity incident. The amount of the potential loss associated with these lawsuits and any potential regulatory action cannot be reasonably estimated based on currently available information.
The Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various other litigation, governmental proceedings and claims, not described above, that arise in the normal course of business. It is not possible to determine the ultimate outcome or the duration of such litigation, governmental proceedings or claims, or the impact that such litigation, proceedings and claims will have on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
As required under GAAP, the Company records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Except with respect to the settlement of the Lease litigation, described above, no loss accrual relating to these matters was recorded because, based on currently available information, the Company does not believe that any contingent liabilities relating to these matters are probable or that the amount of any resulting loss is estimable. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and the Company’s view of these matters may change. Were an unfavorable outcome to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the period in which the unfavorable outcome occurs, and potentially in future periods.

4.50
% Senior Notes due 2029
On October 8, 2021, the Company completed its offering of $
600
 million aggregate principal amount of its 
4.50
% Senior Notes due 2029 (the “Notes”). The Notes were issued under an indenture (the “Indenture”), dated October 8, 2021, among the Company, the guarantors party thereto, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. 
The Notes are guaranteed by each of the Company’s existing, wholly owned domestic subsidiaries that guarantees its obligations under the Credit Agreement (as defined below) and are required to be guaranteed by any of the Company’s future subsidiaries that guarantee its obligations under the Credit Agreement or certain of its other indebtedness. The Notes will mature on October 1, 2029. Interest on the Notes is payable on April 1 and October 1 of each year. As of January 31, 2025, the balance of accrued interest on the Notes was $
9.0
 million, which is included within accrued liabilities on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The effective interest rate on the Notes is 
4.72
%.
The Notes are unsecured senior obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of payment to all of its existing and future senior unsecured debt and senior in right of payment to all of its future subordinated debt.
The Notes are redeemable at the Company’s option, in whole or in part, at any time on or after October 1, 2024, at a redemption price if redeemed during the 12 months beginning (i) October 1, 2024 of 
102.250
%, (ii) October 1, 2025 of 
101.125
%, and (iii) October 1, 2026 and thereafter of 
100.000
%, in each case of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed, and together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. The Company may be required to make an offer to purchase the Notes upon the sale of certain assets or upon specific kinds of changes of control.
The Indenture contains covenants that impose significant operational and financial restrictions on the Company; however, these covenants generally align with the covenants contained in the Credit Agreement. See "Credit Agreement" below for a description of these covenants. 
Credit Agreement
On August 23, 2024, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) among the Company, as borrower, each lender from time to time party thereto (the “Lenders”), JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and the Swing Line Lender (as defined in the Credit Agreement), and each L/C Issuer (as defined therein) party thereto, pursuant to which the Company established a new 
five-year
 senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) in an aggregate principal amount of up to $
1.0
 billion (with a $
25
 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit). The Company borrowed $
511.9
 million under the Revolving Credit Facility to refinance the Prior Credit Agreement (as defined below). The Revolving Credit Facility may be used in the future for working capital and general corporate purposes, including the financing of acquisitions and other investments. As of January 31, 2025, the outstanding balance under the Revolving Credit Facility was $
461.9
 million, which is included within long-term debt, net of issuance costs, on the consolidated balance sheet. The maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility is August 23, 2029.
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement (including obtaining additional commitments from one or more new or existing lenders), the Company may in the future incur additional loans or commitments under the Credit Agreement in an aggregate principal amount of up to $
450
 million, plus an additional amount so long as the Company’s pro forma first lien net leverage ratio would not exceed 
3.85
 to 1.00 as of the date such loans or commitments are incurred.
Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at an annual rate equal to, at the Company’s option, either (i) the secured overnight financing rate published by the CME Group Benchmark Administration Limited (“Term SOFR”) (subject to a 
0.10
% “credit spread adjustment”) plus a margin ranging from 
1.25
% to 
2.50
% or (ii) an alternate base rate plus a margin ranging from 
0.25
% to 
1.50
%, with the applicable margin determined by reference to a leverage-based pricing grid set forth in the Credit Agreement. The Company is also required to pay certain fees to the Lenders, including, among others, a quarterly commitment fee on the average unused amount of the Revolving Credit Facility at a rate ranging from 
0.25
% to 
0.50
%, with the applicable rate also determined by reference to a leverage-based pricing grid set forth in the Credit Agreement. As of January 31, 2025, the interest rate on the Revolving Credit Facility was 
5.91
%.
The loans under the Revolving Credit Facility may be prepaid, and the commitments thereunder may be reduced by the Company without penalty or premium, subject to the reimbursement of customary “breakage costs.”
The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limit, among other things, the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, merge or dissolve, make investments, dispose of assets, engage in sale and leaseback transactions, make 
-66-
Table of Contents
distributions and dividends and prepayments of junior indebtedness, engage in transactions with affiliates, enter into restrictive agreements, amend documentation governing junior indebtedness, modify its fiscal year and modify its organizational documents, in each case, subject to customary exceptions, thresholds, qualifications and “baskets.” In addition, the Credit Agreement contains financial performance covenants, which require the Company to maintain (i) a maximum total net leverage ratio, measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, of no greater than 
5.00
 to 1.00 beginning with the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2025, and (ii) a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio, measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, of no less than 
3.00
 to 1.00 beginning with the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2025. The Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement as of January 31, 2025 and for the period then ended.
The repayment obligation under the Credit Agreement may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default thereunder, including, among other things, failure to pay principal, interest or fees on a timely basis, material inaccuracy of any representation or warranty, failure to comply with covenants, cross-default to other material debt, material judgments, change of control and certain insolvency or bankruptcy-related events, in each case, subject to any certain grace and/or cure periods.
The Company’s obligations under the Credit Agreement are required to be unconditionally guaranteed by each of its existing or subsequently acquired or organized direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries and are secured by security interests in substantially all assets of the Company and the guarantors, in each case, subject to certain customary exceptions.
Prior Credit Agreement
On October 8, 2021, the Company entered into a credit agreement (as amended, the “Prior Credit Agreement”) among the Company, as borrower, each lender from time to time party thereto (the “Prior Lenders”), JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and the Swing Line Lender (as defined in the Prior Credit Agreement), and each L/C Issuer (as defined therein) party thereto, pursuant to which the Company established: 
(i)       a 
five-year
 senior secured term loan A facility (the “Prior Term Loan Facility”), in an aggregate principal amount of $
350
 million; and
(ii)     a 
five-year
 senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Prior Revolving Credit Facility” and, together with the Prior Term Loan Facility, the “Prior Credit Facilities”), in an aggregate principal amount of up to $
1.0
 billion (with a $
25
 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit).
Prior to June 1, 2023, borrowings under the Prior Credit Facilities bore interest at an annual rate equal to, at the option of the Company, either (i) LIBOR (adjusted for reserves) plus a margin ranging from 
1.25
% to 
2.25
% or (ii) an alternate base rate plus a margin ranging from 
0.25
% to 
1.25
%, with the applicable margin determined in either scenario by reference to a leverage-based pricing grid set forth in the Prior Credit Agreement. 
On June 1, 2023, the Company entered into an amendment to the Prior Credit Agreement which replaced interest rate provisions based on LIBOR with the forward-looking term rate based on Term SOFR. As a result, borrowings under the Prior Credit Agreement as so amended bore interest at an annual rate equal to, at the option of the Company, either (i) Term SOFR, plus a 
0.10
% credit spread adjustment, plus a margin ranging from 
1.25
% to 
2.25
%, or (ii) an alternate base rate, plus a margin ranging from 
0.25
% to 
1.25
%, with the applicable margin determined in either scenario by reference to a leverage-based pricing grid set forth in the Prior Credit Agreement (as amended). 
The Company was also required to pay certain fees to the Prior Lenders, including, among others, a quarterly commitment fee on the average unused amount of the Prior Revolving Credit Facility at a rate ranging from 
0.20
% to 
0.40
%, with the applicable rate also determined by reference to a leverage-based pricing grid set forth in the Prior Credit Agreement.
On August 23, 2024, in connection with the entry into the Credit Agreement, the Company repaid all outstanding obligations in the amount of $
511.9
 million under the Prior Credit Agreement and terminated all commitments thereunder.

The Company’s effective tax rate for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023 was 
16.7
%, 
25.8
%, and 
31.4
%, respectively. The difference between the effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory tax rate each period is impacted by a number of factors, including the relative mix of earnings among state jurisdictions, credits, excess tax benefits or shortfalls on stock-based compensation expense, changes in unrecognized tax benefits and valuation allowance, and other items. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025 compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024 was primarily due to an increase in tax deductible stock-based compensation compared to GAAP stock-based compensation expense and a decrease in expense from unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by an increase in pre-tax book income, an increase in nondeductible executive compensation, and increased expense from deferred tax rate adjustments due to state apportionment changes. The increase in the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024 compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 was primarily due to an increase in pre-tax book income, an increase in unrecognized tax benefits, adjustments from settlement of an IRS examination, and a decrease in tax deductible stock-based compensation compared to GAAP stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by an increase in research and development tax credits and a decrease in valuation allowance.

Management considered whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets would be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considered the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities in making this assessment and determined that based on the weight of all available evidence, it is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50%) that the Company will be able to realize all of its federal deferred tax assets and the majority if its state deferred tax assets. The Company recorded a valuation allowance of $
1.1
 million and $
1.2
 million as of January 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, related to certain state deferred tax assets. The $
0.1
 million decrease in valuation allowance recorded is primarily the result of a corresponding increase in unrecognized tax benefits.
As of January 31, 2025, the Company had recorded state net operating loss carryforwards of $
18.5
 million, which begin to expire at various intervals beginning with the tax year ending January 31, 2033. As of January 31, 2025, the Company also had state research and development tax credits of $
13.6
 million, which begin to expire at various intervals beginning with the tax year ending January 31, 2026.
As of January 31, 2025 and 2024, the gross unrecognized tax benefit was $
24.1
 million and $
19.2
 million, respectively. If recognized, $
20.9
 million and $
16.2
 million of the total unrecognized tax benefits would affect the Company's effective tax rate as of January 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Total gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by $
4.9
 million in the period from January 31, 2024 to January 31, 2025.

The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of other income, net in the statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). During the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, the Company recorded penalties and interest of $
0.6
 million, $
0.1
 million, and $
0.4
 million, respectively, related to unrecognized tax benefits. As of January 31, 2025 and 2024, the Company recorded accrued interest and penalties of $
2.0
 million and $
1.4
 million, respectively.
The Company files income tax returns with U.S. federal and state taxing jurisdictions and is currently under examination by the states of California and Texas. Such examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to the Company's taxes, net operating losses, and/or tax credit carryforwards. As a result of the Company's net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards, the Company remains subject to examination by one or more jurisdictions for tax years after 2006.

Incentive Plan.    
During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, the Company adopted the HealthEquity, Inc. 2024 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Incentive Plan"), which provides for the issuance of stock awards to team members, consultants, and directors of the Company. Subject to adjustment as provided in the Incentive Plan, as of January 31, 2025, the aggregate number of shares of the Company’s common stock reserved and available for issuance pursuant to awards granted under the Incentive Plan was 
3.8
 million. No further awards will be made under the Company’s 2014 Equity Incentive Plan.
Stock options
Under the terms of the Incentive Plan, the Company has the ability to grant incentive and nonstatutory stock options to team members, including officers, non-employee directors and consultants of the Company, and Company affiliates. Such stock options are to be exercisable at prices, as determined by the board of directors, which must be equal to no less than the fair value of the Company's common stock at the date of the grant. Stock options granted under the Incentive Plan generally expire 
10
 years from the date of issuance or are forfeited

The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the difference between the fair value of common stock and the exercise price of outstanding, in-the-money stock options. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023 was $
21.7
 million, $
10.1
 million, and $
7.2
 million, respectively. As of January 31, 2025, there was 
no
 unrecorded stock-based compensation expense associated with stock options, and all outstanding stock options were vested.
Restricted stock units
The Company grants RSUs to certain team members, officers, and directors under the Incentive Plan, which vest upon service-based criteria and performance-based criteria. The weighted-average fair value of RSUs granted during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023 was $
86.07
, $
64.16
 and $
75.64
 per share, respectively.
Service-based restricted stock units.
    Service-based RSUs generally vest 
25
% on the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date, which is generally the first day of the fiscal quarter of the grant date, with the remaining portion vesting ratably over the following 12 calendar quarters. Service-based RSUs are valued based on the Company's closing stock price on the date of grant less the present value of future expected dividends discounted at the risk-free interest rate. 
Performance restricted stock units.
    During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, the Company awarded 
182,044
 performance restricted stock units ("PRSUs") subject to a market condition based on the Company’s total shareholder return relative to the Russell 2000 index as measured on January 31, 2027. The Company used a Monte Carlo simulation to determine that the grant date fair value of the awards was $
20.2
 million. Compensation expense is recorded over the requisite service period if the service condition is met regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied. The market condition allows for a range of vesting from 
0
% to 
200
% based on the level of performance achieved. The PRSUs cliff vest upon approval by the Talent, Compensation and Culture Committee of the board of directors.
In addition, during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, the Company awarded 
60,682
 PRSUs subject to the achievement of certain financial criteria measured on January 31, 2027. The PRSUs cliff vest upon approval by the Talent, Compensation and Culture Committee. The Company records stock-based compensation related to PRSUs over the requisite service period when it is considered probable that the performance conditions will be met. The Company believes it is probable that the PRSUs will vest at least in part. The vesting of the PRSUs will ultimately range from 
0
% to 
200
% of the number of shares underlying the PRSU grant based on the level of achievement of the performance goals.
Each of the PRSUs granted during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025 contains a provision such that upon the award holder's eligible retirement, the PRSUs would remain outstanding and eligible to vest based on achievement of their respective market or performance conditions without regard to the award holder’s continued employment on the vesting date. Based on the application of ASC 718, 
Compensation - Stock Compensation
, expense is recognized over the requisite service period, which ends on the earlier of (1) the date of approval by the Talent, Compensation and Culture Committee or (2) the date the award holder becomes eligible for retirement (defined as at least 55 years old with least 10 years of service at the Company). As a result, the expense associated with PRSUs granted to retirement-eligible individuals was recorded on the grant date.

Stockholders' equity

Stock repurchase program
In September 2024, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a common stock repurchase program. Under the program, the Company may purchase up to $
300
 million of its common stock, as market conditions warrant. The common stock may be repurchased at prices that the Company deems appropriate and subject to market conditions, applicable law and other factors deemed relevant in the Company's sole discretion. Such repurchases may be effected through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, including repurchase plans that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The stock repurchase program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of common stock, and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.
The following table sets forth the common stock repurchased and subsequently retired during the periods presented:

177.8
 million of common stock remained authorized for repurchase under the Company's stock repurchase program.
Adequacy of net worth
In February 2006, HealthEquity received designation by the U.S. Department of Treasury to act as a passive non-bank custodian, which allows HealthEquity to hold custodial assets for individual account holders. On July 24, 2017, HealthEquity received designation by the U.S. Department of Treasury to act as both a passive and non-passive non-bank custodian, which allows HealthEquity to hold custodial assets for individual account holders and use discretion to direct investment of such assets held. As a passive and non-passive non-bank custodian according to Treasury Regulations section 1.408-2(e)(5)(ii)(B), the Company must maintain net worth (assets minus liabilities) greater than the sum of 
2
% of passive custodial funds held at each fiscal year-end and 
4
% of the non-passive custodial funds held at each fiscal year-end in order to take on additional custodial assets. As of January 31, 2025, the Company's year-end for trust and tax purposes, the net worth of the Company exceeded the required thresholds.
Note 11. 
Fair value

Fair value measurements are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most 
-72-
Table of Contents
advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Accounting standards specify a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s market assumptions. These two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy:
•
Level 1—quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
•
Level 2—inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and
•
Level 3—unobservable inputs based on the Company’s own assumptions.
Cash and cash equivalents are considered Level 1 instruments and are valued based on publicly available daily net asset values. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents approximate fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
The Notes are valued based upon quoted market prices and are considered Level 2 instruments because the markets in which the Notes trade are not considered active markets. As of January 31, 2025, the fair value of the Notes was $
567.0
 million.
The Revolving Credit Facility is considered a Level 2 instrument and recorded at book value in the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Revolving Credit Facility reprices frequently due to variable interest rate terms and entails no significant changes in credit risk. As a result, the fair value of the Revolving Credit Facility approximates carrying value.
Note 12. 
Employee benefits
The Company has established a 401(k) plan that qualifies as a deferred compensation arrangement under Section 401 of the IRS Code. All non-seasonal team members over the age of 18 are eligible to participate in the plan. The plan provides for Company matching of employee contributions up to 
3.5
% of eligible earnings. Employer matching contribution expense was $
8.4
 million, $
8.7
 million and $
8.0
 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The Company is self-insured for medical and dental benefits for all qualifying employees. The medical plan carries a stop-loss policy which will protect from individual claims during the plan year exceeding $
600,000
. The Company records estimates of costs of claims incurred based on an analysis of historical data and independent estimates. The Company's liability for self-insured medical claims is included in accrued compensation in its consolidated balance sheet and was $
5.2
 million and $
4.7
 million as of January 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures
Management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of January 31, 2025, the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
Based on such evaluation, our CEO and our CFO have concluded that as of January 31, 2025, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
Management's report on internal control over financial reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025 based on criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) 
(“COSO Framework”)
.
Based on that assessment, management has concluded that, as of January 31, 2025, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.
The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has audited the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025. Its report appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended January 31, 2025 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
