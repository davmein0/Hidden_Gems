Item 2. Properties
We lease our corporate offices in Miami, Florida and Toronto, Ontario along with all our data centers across Canada and the United States related to our Compute and Digital Infrastructure business segments. We maintain various leases with respect to our Bitcoin mining sites and own the 1.9 acres of land on which the Salt Creek substation sits. We also indirectly own four natural gas power plants in Ontario, Canada through an 80.1% interest in a joint venture entity, Far North Power Corp. (the “Far North JV”) in partnership with Macquarie.
We believe our existing facilities are sufficient for our current needs. In the future, we may reassess our existing facilities or add new facilities as we further expand our operations. We believe suitable space will be available on commercially reasonable terms to meet our future needs.
