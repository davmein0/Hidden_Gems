Key Factors Affecting Our Performance
Price of Bitcoin
Our business is heavily dependent on the price of Bitcoin, which has historically experienced significant volatility. We generate revenue from Bitcoin rewards that we earn through mining in our facilities. We have also acquired, and may in the future acquire, additional Bitcoin through at-market purchases to build our strategic reserve of Bitcoin. Under ASU 2023-08, 
Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60): Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets
 (“ASU 2023-08”), Bitcoin is revalued at fair value at the end of each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized in net income. As a result, fluctuations in the price of Bitcoin may significantly impact our results of operations.
Bitcoin network difficulty and hashrate 
Our business is not only impacted by the volatility in Bitcoin prices, but also by increases in the competition for Bitcoin production. This increased competition is described as the network hashrate resulting from the growth in the overall quantity and quality of miners working to solve blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain, and the difficulty index associated with the secure hashing algorithm employed in solving the blocks. Increased difficulty reduces the mining proceeds of the equipment proportionally and eventually requires Bitcoin miners like us to upgrade their equipment to remain profitable and compete effectively with other miners. Conversely, a decline in network hashrate results in a decrease in difficulty, increasing mining proceeds and profitability.
Block reward and halving
The current Bitcoin reward for solving a block is 3.125 Bitcoin. The Bitcoin network is programmed such that the Bitcoin block reward is halved every 210,000 blocks mined, or approximately every four years due to the Halving. This reduction in reward spreads out the release of Bitcoin over a long period of time as an even smaller number of coins are mined with each Halving. Bitcoin Halving events impact the amount of Bitcoin we mine which, in turn, may have a potential impact on our results of operations. The last Halving occurred in April 2024 and the next Halving is expected to occur in 2028. 
Power Costs
Power is the foundation of our platform. We acquire, develop, and manage critical energy assets such as interconnects, powered land, and other electrical infrastructure to address the load demands of energy-intensive applications such as Bitcoin mining and HPC. We currently maintain a portfolio of competitively priced electrical power. However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to negotiate additional power agreements on similar terms, or at all. Market prices for power, capacity, and other ancillary services are unpredictable and tend to fluctuate substantially. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Operations—We are subject to risks associated with our need for significant electrical power.”

Cost to mine a Bitcoin
Our profitability in self-mining is heavily dependent upon our cost to mine a Bitcoin, calculated as all-in electricity and hosting costs divided by Bitcoin mined during the respective periods and includes our net share of the King Mountain JV. Our management reviews the cost to mine a Bitcoin excluding hosted facilities and inclusive of hosted facilities in order to assess performance under both cost structures. As of December 31, 2024, we had no Bitcoin operations in hosted facilities.
55

Table of Contents
Our cost to mine a Bitcoin (excluding hosted facilities) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 was $27,959 compared to $13,198 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the Halving in April 2024, in addition to an increase in average network difficulty during the period (87.3T for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 compared to 51.8T for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023). This was partially offset by a decrease in our energy cost per MWh (see below for further discussion on energy cost per MWh). Our cost to mine a Bitcoin (excluding hosted facilities) for the six months ended December 31, 2023 was $16,353 compared to $16,447 for the six months ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in our energy cost per MWh (see below for further discussion on energy cost per MWh), partially offset by an increase in network difficulty as more energy was utilized to mine a Bitcoin during the 2023 period compared to the 2022 period. Our cost to mine a Bitcoin (excluding hosted facilities) for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022 was $14,672 and $13,161, respectively. The increase was also driven by an increase in network difficulty, which raised our energy utilized to mine a Bitcoin. 
Inclusive of hosted facilities, our cost to mine a Bitcoin for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 was $28,161 compared to $16,570 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the Halving in April 2024, in addition to an increase in average network difficulty during the period. Our cost to mine a Bitcoin for the six months ended December 31, 2023 was $18,815 compared to $16,305 for the six months ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in network difficulty and further augmented by an increase in hosting costs per MWh (see below for further discussion on hosting cost per MWh). Our cost to mine a Bitcoin for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 was $15,117 compared to $13,175 for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022. The increase was primarily due to an increase in our hosting rate, which became variable in the 2023 period, and an increase in network difficulty, which raised our energy utilized to mine a Bitcoin. 
Energy and hosting cost per MWh 
In addition to the cost to mine a Bitcoin, our management reviews the energy cost per MWh at facilities we own and the hosting cost per MWh at hosted facilities to better understand cost efficiency, operational performance, and identify opportunities for overall profitability improvements. Energy cost per MWh is calculated by dividing our total energy expense by the total MWh utilized at owned facilities during the respective periods and includes our net share of the King Mountain JV. Hosting cost per MWh is calculated by dividing our total hosting expense by the total MWh utilized at hosted facilities during the respective periods.
​
Energy cost per MWh for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 was $32.52 compared to $40.80 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by lower energy costs at our newly built Salt Creek site and efficient economic curtailment of miners using our proprietary Reactor software. The twelve months ended December 31, 2024 includes twelve months of combined company self-mining activity at our Alpha, Medicine Hat, and Salt Creek sites, and our net share of activity at the King Mountain site, whereas the prior year reflects eleven months of USBTC’s self-mining activity at our Alpha site and our net share at the King Mountain site as well as one month of combined company self-mining activity, including Medicine Hat and Drumheller. Energy cost per MWh for the six months ended December 31, 2023 was $44.52 compared to $73.19 for the six months ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by lower energy costs at King Mountain compared to our previous facility in Pecos, Texas, which we exchanged in February 2023 for extinguishment of debt. Energy cost per MWh for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022 was $61.51 and $70.77, respectively. The decrease was also driven by lower energy costs at King Mountain compared to the former Pecos, Texas facility.
​
Hosting cost per MWh for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 was $68.72 compared to $62.57 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. Even though we exited two sites owned by a third-party hosting provider located in Kearney, Nebraska (“Kearney”) and Granbury, Texas (“Granbury”) on April 30, 2024, the increase was due to a higher variable hosting rate (tied to hashprice) at these sites, as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. Hosting cost per MWh for the six months ended December 31, 2023 was $63.33 compared to $22.61 for the six months ended December 31, 2022. The increase was due to a higher variable hosting rate at the Delta site during the 2023 period compared to the hosting costs charged by the site’s former operator during the 2022 period. Hosting cost per MWh for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022 were $60.47 and $56.00, respectively. The increase was due to a higher variable hosting rate during the 2023 period compared to a fixed rate during the 2022 period.

Number of Bitcoin in strategic reserve
Number of Bitcoin in strategic reserve represents the number of Bitcoin we own as of each reporting period end date, which is the aggregate number of our Bitcoin held in custody, pledged as collateral, or pledged for a miner purchase. We have the ability to leverage our Bitcoin in strategic reserve as a flexible financial asset to fund growth initiatives, optimize our balance sheet, and capitalize on emerging market opportunities. Our management uses this metric to assess the value of our Bitcoin in strategic reserve and determine when and how to deploy said reserve, including continuing to hold the Bitcoin. 
As of December 31, 2024, we had 10,171 Bitcoin in strategic reserve. The majority of our Bitcoin was acquired as a result of the Business Combination. As noted in the 2024 Highlights above, we purchased approximately 990 Bitcoin in December 2024, of which 968 were pledged for a miner purchase under an agreement with BITMAIN for our miner fleet upgrade.
Number of Bitcoin mined
Number of Bitcoin mined represents the number of Bitcoin produced by our Compute segment during the respective period. Management views this metric as a direct driver of Compute revenue for the respective periods. 
Number of Bitcoin mined for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 1,466 and 2,789, respectively. The decrease in number of Bitcoin mined was mainly due to an increase in network difficulty and the Halving. Number of Bitcoin mined for the six months ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was 1,527 and 1,347, respectively. The increase in number of Bitcoin mined was mainly due to twelve months of combined company activity in 2024 compared to one month of combined company activity in 2023. Number of Bitcoin mined for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022 was 2,610 and 1,636 respectively. The increase in number of Bitcoin mined was due to an increase in the number of miners in operation. 
Energy capacity under management
Energy capacity under management comprises energy capacity under management (mining) and all other energy-related assets including Power Generation, CPU Colocation infrastructure, and non-operational sites. Energy capacity under management (mining) represents the total power capacity related to Bitcoin mining infrastructure, including self-mining sites, ASIC Colocation agreements, and Managed Services agreements. Management reviews these metrics to assess total energy capacity utilization across our operations to drive an efficient allocation of resources.
​
Energy capacity under management for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 was 1,020 MW compared to 842 MW for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. The increase was due to the acquisition of Far North, consisting of 310 MW across four natural gas power generation facilities in Canada, and Vega, a 205 MW facility that is currently under development. Energy capacity under management for the six months ended December 31, 2023 was 842 MW compared to 730 MW for the six months ended December 31, 2022. The increase was due to the addition of two self-mining facilities, Medicine Hat and Drumheller, and five cloud and colocation data centers due to the Business Combination. Energy capacity under management for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022 were 730 MW and 92 MW, respectively. The increase was due to the addition of two Managed Service sites, Kearney (100 MW) and Granbury (300 MW), and 280 MW at the King Mountain site, also under the Managed Services line of business, partially offset by the loss of our former Pecos, Texas site, which was 42 MW. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we concluded our Managed Services operations at the Kearney and Granbury sites. We received a $13.5 million payment from MARA Holdings Inc. (“MARA”) in connection with the termination of the property management agreements at those two sites.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we rely on Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our business, measure our performance, and make strategic decisions. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), adjusted for impacts of interest expense, income tax provision or benefit, depreciation and amortization, foreign exchange gains or losses, gain on debt extinguishment, gain on derivatives, gain on bargain purchase, our share of unconsolidated joint venture depreciation and amortization, the removal of non-recurring transactions, impairment on assets, gain or loss on sale of property and equipment, loss from discontinued operations, net loss attributable to non-controlling interests, and stock-based compensation expense in the period presented. You are encouraged to evaluate each of these adjustments and the reasons our Board and management team consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis.
Our Board and management team use Adjusted EBITDA to assess our financial performance because it allows them to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of our capital structure (such as varying levels of interest expense and income), asset base (such as depreciation and amortization), and other items (such as non-recurring transactions mentioned above) that impact the comparability of financial results from period to period.
Net income (loss) is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in such presentation. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. There can be no assurance that we will not modify the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA in the future, and any such modification may be material. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of this non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility.
For a reconciliation to our most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, please see “—Results of Operations” below.
Business Segments 
We have four reportable business segments: Power, Digital Infrastructure, Compute, and Other.  
Power
The Power business segment consists of Power Generation and Managed Services.
Power Generation
We generate revenue from our 80.1% interest in the Far North JV, which provides capacity and energy to the electrical grid through four natural gas power plants in Ontario, Canada. The power generation facilities are connected to the Independent Electricity System Operator, which operates Ontario’s power grid, and primarily generate revenue from capacity and electricity sales. Revenue generated from capacity and electricity sales is variable and depends on several factors including generation capacity in the market, the supply and demand for electricity, and the prevailing price of natural gas. 
Managed Services
Our Managed Services business provides institutional partners with an end-to-end partnership model for energy infrastructure development, including:
●
Project inception
: site design, procurement, and construction management;  

58

Table of Contents
●
Project operationalization
: software automation, process design, personnel hiring, and team training;  

●
Revenue management
: utilities contracts, hosting operations, and customer management;  

●
Project optimization
: energy portfolio optimization and strategic initiatives; and/or  

●
Compliance and reporting
: finance, accounting, and safety.  

Cash flows are generated through a fee structure that is typically fixed based on power capacity under management, with reimbursement of passthrough costs. In addition to the fixed fee, under certain agreements, further cash flows may be driven from incentive bonuses and certain energy management services.  
As of December 31, 2024, we managed 280 MW of energy capacity under this program at one site in the United States owned by the King Mountain JV.
Digital Infrastructure
The Digital Infrastructure business segment consists of CPU Colocation and ASIC Colocation services.
CPU Colocation
Our CPU Colocation business spans five locations in Canada (Mississauga, Ontario; Vaughan, Ontario; Kelowna, British Columbia; and two locations in Vancouver, British Columbia) with a total energy capacity of 3 MW and more than 36,000 square feet of geo-diverse data center space powered by predominantly emission-free energy sources. Our infrastructure is designed to support a variety of compute, storage, and network workloads across traditional enterprise, B2B, machine learning, visual effects, and AI. This segment serves computing needs unrelated to Bitcoin Mining. These data centers are geo-diverse and carrier neutral with network diversity and redundancy from multiple telecommunications providers.
Our CPU Colocation business is based on a fixed-fee model. Customers pay a fixed recurring monthly fee based on a set amount of resources assigned. 
ASIC Colocation
Under our ASIC Colocation business, we enter into contracts to host and operate mining equipment on behalf of third parties within our facilities. These services include the provision, if applicable, and hosting of mining equipment as well as the monitoring, troubleshooting, repair, and maintenance of such equipment. Revenues from ASIC Colocation services are generated through fees that may be fixed or based on profit-sharing arrangements, often with reimbursement for certain pass-through costs such as electricity.
During the fourth quarter of 2024, our agreement with Ionic Digital Inc. (“Ionic”) to host approximately 8,500 miners (0.8 EH/s) at our Alpha site was terminated. As a result, we ceased providing ASIC Colocation services at Alpha and utilized the site solely for self-mining purposes.
Looking ahead, we have secured a new ASIC Colocation contract with BITMAIN. The agreement features a fixed hosting fee with an option for us to purchase all or a portion of the hosted machines in up to three tranches at a fixed price within six months of energization of the relevant tranches. In July 2024, we entered into a power purchase agreement and other definitive agreements for a site in the Texas Panhandle with exclusive access to 205 MW of immediately available power capacity and land. The data center construction at Vega is expected to be completed in Q2 2025.
Compute
The Compute business segment consists of Bitcoin Mining, GPU-as-a-Service, and Data Center Cloud operations.

Table of Contents
Bitcoin Mining
Currently, one of our largest revenue streams is derived from Bitcoin Mining (also referred to as self-mining).
Our Bitcoin Mining business spanned four sites as of December 31, 2024:
●
three sites with facilities we own and/or lease, and operate: (1) Alpha (Niagara Falls, New York), (2) Medicine Hat (Medicine Hat, Alberta), and (3) Salt Creek (Orla, Texas); and 

●
one site that we own 50% of through a joint venture, King Mountain (McCamey, Texas)
. 
​
Until April 30, 2024, we also had Bitcoin Mining operations at Kearney and Granbury. We also own a Bitcoin Mining site in Drumheller, Alberta, which has been non-operational since March 2024. The closure was due to the profitability of Drumheller being significantly impacted by several factors, including elevated energy costs and underlying voltage issues. We will consider re-energizing the site if market conditions improve. 
We receive Bitcoin rewards from our mining activity through third-party mining pool operators, which allow miners to combine their processing power, increasing their chances of solving a block and getting paid by the network. We provide computing power to mining pools, which use this computing power to operate nodes and validate blocks on the blockchain. The pools then distribute our pro-rata share of Bitcoin mined to us based on the computing power we contribute. 
GPU-as-a-Service
Our GPU assets are deployed under our wholly owned subsidiary, Highrise AI, Inc., at a third-party colocation site near Chicago, Illinois. This segment generates recurring revenue through payments made by the provider to us based on fixed infrastructure payments and a revenue share tied to GPU utilization. 
Data Center Cloud
Our Data Center Cloud services support both public and private cloud deployments, managed backup, business continuity and disaster recovery services, and high-performance, high-capacity storage solutions. We employ a consumption-based fee structure where customers commit to a baseline level of compute, storage, network, or power usage as defined in their service agreements. Any usage beyond this baseline is typically billed incrementally, so costs are aligned with actual resource consumption and customers are afforded flexibility as their needs evolve.
Other  

Equipment Sales and Repairs
We may sell mining equipment when profitable opportunities arise (e.g., if market prices exceed our procurement cost). We may also repair miners for third parties in exchange for a fee, as we have a fully equipped, MicroBT-certified repair center space at our Medicine Hat site.

Non-recurring transactions for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 represent approximately $4.0 million of restructuring costs and $1.9 million related to the Far North transaction costs, offset by a $13.5 million contract termination fee received from MARA, and a $2.2 million tax refund. Non-recurring transactions for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 represent approximately $9.6 million related to a sales tax accrual and $2.4 million of transaction costs related to the Business Combination, partially offset by a gain from a legal settlement of $1.5 million.
​
Revenue
Total revenue was $162.4 million and $96.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively, and consisted of Power, Digital Infrastructure, Compute, and Other.
Power
Power revenue was $56.6 million and $22.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This $33.8 million increase was primarily driven by (i) a $13.5 million contract termination fee received from MARA, (ii) a $11.4 million increase in electricity sales related to Far North, which we acquired in February 2024, and (iii) a $8.9 million increase in Managed Services revenue related to the Ionic Managed Services agreement, which was entered into during January 2024 and terminated effective December 2024.
Digital Infrastructure
Digital Infrastructure revenue was $17.5 million and $8.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This $9.2 million increase was primarily driven by (i) a $5.2 million increase in CPU Colocation revenue, reflecting a full year of revenue recognition following the Business Combination, and (ii) a $4.0 million increase in cost reimbursements related to the Ionic colocation agreement.

Table of Contents
Compute
Compute revenue was $80.7 million and $64.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This $15.8 million increase was primarily driven by (i) a $7.3 million increase in Bitcoin Mining revenue, largely due to an increase in the average revenue per Bitcoin mined from $30,398 to $60,436, partially offset by a decrease in Bitcoin mined, due to an increase in network difficulty and the Halving event (we mined 1,184 Bitcoin during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 versus 2,138 Bitcoin mined during the twelve months ended December 31, 2023), (ii) a $6.7 million increase in recurring Data Center Cloud revenue, reflecting a full year of Data Center Cloud operations during twelve months ended December 31, 2024 compared to one month of Data Center Cloud operations following the Business Combination, and (iii) a $1.8 million contribution from our GPU-as-a-Service offering, which launched in September 2024.
Other
Other revenue was $7.6 million and nil for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This increase was primarily driven by (i) a $7.4 million increase in Equipment Sales revenue, reflecting higher demand for mining-related infrastructure, and (ii) a $0.2 million increase in Equipment Repair services revenue.
Cost of Revenue 
Total cost of revenue was $86.7 million and $54.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively, and consisted of Power, Digital Infrastructure, Compute, and Other.
Power
Power cost of revenue was $21.5 million and $7.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This $14.2 million increase was primarily driven by (i) a $12.8 million increase in cost of revenue related to Far North, which was acquired in February 2024, and (ii) a $1.4 million increase in operating costs related to the Ionic Managed Services agreement, which was terminated effective December 2024. 
Digital Infrastructure
Digital Infrastructure cost of revenue was $15.6 million and $4.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This $11.2 million increase was primarily driven by (i) a $7.5 million increase in colocation-related costs as a result of eleven months of costs related to the Ionic colocation agreement during 2024 compared to five months of costs during 2023, and (ii) a $3.8 million increase in cost of sales related to CPU Colocation operations, including rent, electricity, and connectivity costs.
Compute
Compute cost of revenue was $45.0 million and $42.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This $2.4 million increase was primarily driven by (i) a $5.5 million increase in 
Data Center Cloud
 costs, reflecting a full year of 
Data Center Cloud
 operations during twelve months ended December 31, 2024 compared to one month of 
Data Center Cloud
 operations during twelve months ended December 31, 2023 following the Business Combination, and (ii) a $1.0 million increase in costs related to our new GPU-as-a-Service offering, launched in September 2024. These increases were partially offset by $4.1 million decrease in Bitcoin Mining costs due to fleet relocation from higher cost hosted to lower cost self-mining sites and the deployment of Reactor, our proprietary energy curtailment software.
Other
Other cost of revenue was $4.6 million and nil for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This $4.6 million increase was primarily driven by (i) a $4.5 million increase in Equipment Sales costs as a result of the increased volume of equipment sold, and (ii) $0.1 million in costs related to our Equipment Repair service.

​
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization expense was $47.8 million and $17.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This $30.3 million increase was primarily driven by (i) higher depreciation from assets acquired in the Business Combination as we recognized twelve months of combined company depreciation in 2024 compared to one month of combined company depreciation in 2023, (ii) depreciation related to the Far North transaction, which was completed in February 2024, (iii) depreciation as a result of the development of the Salt Creek site, which went live in April 2024, and (iv) depreciation from the newly acquired assets related to GPU-as-a-Service operations.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative (“G&A”) expenses were $72.9 million and $49.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This $23.8 million increase was primarily driven by (i) a $10.6 million increase in salary and benefits

due to twelve months of combined company expenses in 2024 compared to one month of combined company expenses in 2023 (our number of employees increased from 108 employees as of November 30, 2023, the date of the Business Combination, to 220 employees as of December 31, 2024), (ii) a $7.2 million increase in stock-based compensation due to new restricted stock unit and performance stock unit grants to retain and incentivize our talent, partially offset by no restricted stock award activity in 2024 compared to $8.5 million of restricted stock activity in 2023, (iii) a $3.9 million increase in restructuring expenses related to the Business Combination and, (iv) a $1.9 million increase in costs related to Far North acquisition. 
Gains on digital assets
Gains on digital assets were $509.3 million and $32.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This increase was due to the increased Bitcoin prices as of December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year period. The price of Bitcoin as of December 31, 2024 was approximately $93,354 compared to $42,288 as of December 31, 2023.
Other expense
Other expense was $8.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, compared to other income of $12.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. This $21.2 million increase was primarily driven by (i) a $17.7 million decrease in gain on debt extinguishment related to the Anchorage debt-to-equity conversion of $6.0 million in 2024, compared to $23.7 million debt extinguishment related to the NYDIG loan recorded in 2023, (ii) a $3.6 million increase in interest expense due to an increase in the amount of borrowing in 2024 compared to 2023, which comprised of the $150.0 million Coatue note and the additional $15.0 million drawdown from our loan with Coinbase Credit, Inc. (“Coinbase”), (iii) a $6.0 million increase in foreign exchange loss due to our net U.S. dollar monetary liability position in our Canadian dollar functional currency subsidiaries and a decline in the Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate of approximately 8% compared to a 2% increase during the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 (the increase noted in the prior period is for the period from the Business Combination to December 31, 2023, reflecting one month of combined company results), and (iv) a $2.0 million decrease in equity in earnings of King Mountain JV due to the impact of the Halving on Bitcoin Mining revenue. These increases were partially offset by (i) a $7.3 million gain on derivatives due to an increase in the mark-to-market value of our call options and Bitcoin redemption option, and (ii) a $3.1 million gain on bargain purchase related to the Far North acquisition driven by the fair value of the net assets acquired being greater than the consideration transferred. 
Income tax
Our income tax provision was $113.5 million and $0.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This $113.3 million increase was primarily due to $93.0M in deferred taxes related to the gain on the fair value of our Bitcoin holdings, in addition to higher taxable income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024.

Non-recurring transactions for the six months ended December 31, 2023 represent approximately $2.4 million of transaction costs related to the Business Combination and $9.6 million related to a sales tax accrual.
​
Revenue
Total revenue for the six months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $59.9 million and $46.0 million, respectively, consisting of Power, Digital Infrastructure, Compute, and Other.
Power
Power revenue was $12.6 million for the six months ended December 31, 2023, consisting of $9.6 million in fees from Managed Services and $3.0 million in cost reimbursements. Power revenue was $2.6 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, consisting of $1.5 million in fees and $1.1 million in cost reimbursements. We began our Managed Services offerings for third parties in November 2022; therefore, the six months ended December 31, 2023 reflects a full period of activity related to Managed Services, whereas the comparative period of the six months ended December 31, 2022 reflects less than two months of activity. The six months ended December 31, 2023 also includes revenue from an interim Managed Services agreement with Celsius Mining LLC, which was signed in December 2023.
Digital Infrastructure
Digital Infrastructure revenue was $5.8 million and $14.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Revenue for the six months ended December 31, 2023 primarily consisted of hosting services revenue from the Alpha site and included one month of recurring CPU Colocation revenue as a result of the Business Combination. Revenue for the six months ended December 31, 2022 consisted of $14.0 million in hosting services revenue. During the 2022 period, one of our hosting customers defaulted on its contract, resulting in contract termination without a refund obligation for prepaid amounts. This resulted in the recognition of $13.1 million in remaining deferred revenue related to this customer.
Compute
Compute revenue consisted of Bitcoin Mining revenue of $41.3 million and $25.7 million for the six months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. This was driven by an increase in the average price per Bitcoin mined and one month of combined company activity after the Business Combination. The average revenue per Bitcoin mined was approximately $33,331 as of December 31, 2023 compared to approximately $20,218 as of December 31, 2022. This was partially offset by a decrease of approximately 29 Bitcoin mined, exclusive of our net share of the King Mountain JV, period over period due to increased Bitcoin network difficulty.

Other 
Other revenue was $0.1 million and $3.6 million for the six months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Other revenue for the six months ended December 31, 2023 consisted of $0.1 million in Equipment Repair services revenue. Other revenue for the six months ended December 31, 2022 consisted of $3.6 million in Equipment Sales. 
Cost of revenue
Power
Cost of revenue for Power for the six months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $3.4 million and $1.1 million, respectively, primarily consisting of reimbursable payroll and other site operating costs. The increase in costs is attributable to the full six months of activity in the 2023 period compared to only two months of activity related to Managed Services in the 2022 period.
Digital Infrastructure
Cost of revenue for Digital Infrastructure for the six months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $4.3 million and $0.4 million, respectively, primarily driven by an increase in the cost of hosting services, including power costs, at our Alpha site due to an increase in hosted miners at the site. 
Compute
Cost of revenue for Compute for the six months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $26.0 million and $23.2 million, respectively, driven primarily by a 46% increase in electricity utilized, partially offset by a lower average power rate during the period ($61.17 compared to $73.95 for the six months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively). 
Other
Cost of revenue for Other for the six months ended December 31, 2023 was less than $0.1 million due to low activity, as there were no Equipment Sales. Cost of revenue for Other for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $3.1 million due to the cost of mining equipment sold. 
Depreciation and amortization
Depreciation and amortization expense was $10.6 million and $11.8 million for the six months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily driven by the lower net book value of plant and equipment after the recognition of a non-cash impairment charge during the six months ended December 31, 2022 as part of annual impairment testing, partially offset by property and equipment acquired as part of the Business Combination. 
General and administrative expenses
G&A expenses were $37.5 million and $10.6 million for the six months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in G&A expenses was driven by (i) a $9.0 million increase in stock-based compensation due to certain stock options granted and restricted stock awards that were accelerated upon the closing of the Business Combination and certain stock options and restricted stock awards that were issued and immediately vested before the closing of the Business Combination, (ii) a $3.7 million increase in salary and benefit costs due to the headcount increasing from 49 to 208 employees as part of the Business Combination and to support the Company’s growth, and (iii) a $9.6 million sales tax provision from a non-recurring state tax accrual related to a facility build out in Texas. G&A expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2023 also include one-time transaction costs of $2.4 million primarily related to the Business Combination.

Table of Contents
Gains on digital assets
Gains on digital assets was $32.6 million and nil for the six months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase was due to our early adoption of ASU 2023-08 for the six months ended December 31, 2023, which requires us to recognize our digital assets at fair value with changes recognized in net income during the reporting period.
Impairment of long-lived assets  
Impairment of long-lived assets, including right-of-use assets, was nil and $63.6 million for the six months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, adverse changes in the business climate, including decrease in the price of Bitcoin to approximately $16,530 as of December 31, 2022, and the resulting decrease in the market price of miners and mining equipment, indicated that an impairment triggering event had occurred. Testing performed indicated that the estimated fair value of our miners, mining equipment, and other mining operation assets were less than their net carrying value as of December 31, 2022. An impairment charge of approximately $63.6 million was recognized, decreasing the net carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair value. 
Other expense
Other expense totaled $4.5 million for the six months ended December 31, 2023 compared to $15.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022. The decrease of $10.7 million was primarily driven by a $6.7 million increase in equity in earnings of our unconsolidated joint venture and a decrease of $3.0 million in interest expense driven by the NYDIG debt restructuring in February 2023. 
Income tax
Our income tax benefit was $0.4 million and $1.8 million for the six months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. This $1.4 million decrease was primarily due to lower taxable income for the six months ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior period.

Non-recurring transactions for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 represent a gain from a legal settlement of $1.5 million and the twelve months ended June 30, 2022 represent cash payments of approximately $5.3 million for certain employees and advisors related to their personal income taxes on the issuance of stock grants and a $1.0 million payment made to a government agency associated with the Rescission Offer.
​
Revenue
Total revenue for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 was $82.2 million and $73.7 million, respectively, consisting of Power, Digital Infrastructure, Compute, and Other.
69

Table of Contents
Power
Power revenue was $12.8 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, consisting of fees from Managed Services of $7.6 million and cost reimbursements of $5.2 million. Power revenue was nil for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022 as we launched our Managed Services offering in November 2022.
Digital Infrastructure
Digital Infrastructure revenue was $16.5 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, consisting entirely of hosting services revenue. Digital Infrastructure revenue was $5.6 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022. We launched our hosting services business in March 2022 so the twelve months ended June 30, 2022 represents only four months of activity compared to a full year of activity in the twelve months ended June 30, 2023.

One of our hosting customers defaulted on its contract during the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, which resulted in a termination of the contract without an obligation to refund any prepayments, and we recognized the remaining deferred revenue of $13.1 million with respect to such customer.
Compute
Compute revenue was $49.2 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 compared to $68.2 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022. While we mined approximately 532 more Bitcoin year-over-year, the average price per Bitcoin mined was approximately $22,900 for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 compared to approximately $41,700 for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022. The increase in number of Bitcoin mined was due to additional miners in our self-mining fleet during the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the twelve months ended June 30, 2022. The increase in production was partially offset by lower Bitcoin prices and an increase in Bitcoin network difficulty.
Other
Other revenue was $3.6 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, consisting entirely of Equipment Sales. Other revenue was nil for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022 as there were no Equipment Sales or Repairs during this period. 
Cost of revenue
Power 
Cost of revenue for Power for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 was $1.0 million compared to nil for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022 as we launched our Managed Services business in November 2022.
Digital Infrastructure 
Cost of revenue for Digital Infrastructure for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 was $0.4 million compared to $2.4 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022. The decrease was driven by a $2.0 million reduction in costs related to our hosting services revenue in the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 as one of our two hosting contracts was terminated in July 2022 so we only had one hosting contract for the remainder of the period.
Compute
Cost of revenue for Compute for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 was $38.6 million compared to $23.4 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by additional miners being operated during the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 resulting in higher power expense and hosting expense for the miners that were hosted at third party sites.
70

Table of Contents
Other
Cost of revenue for Other for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 was $3.1 million related to the cost of mining equipment sold during the period. The cost of revenue for Other for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022 was nil, as there were no Equipment Sales or Repairs during the period.
Depreciation and amortization
Depreciation and amortization expense was $18.8 million and $11.6 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The purchase of additional miners and other property and equipment during the twelve months ended June 30, 2022 resulted in an increase in the depreciable asset base for the following twelve-month period.
General and administrative expenses
G&A expenses were $27.3 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 compared to $31.3 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease of $5.3 million related to payments to employees and advisors related to personal income taxes for the issuance of stock grants, and a decrease of $1.0 million related to a payment made to a government agency associated with the Rescission Offer. This was partially offset by increases in legal and professional fees during the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 due to the launch of our Managed Services business in November 2022, restructuring our debt obligations with NYDIG and Anchorage in February 2023, and fees related to the Business Combination.
Impairment of digital assets
Impairment of digital assets was $3.7 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 compared to $30.3 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022. 
Impairment resulted from declines in the lowest intra-day price of Bitcoin during the period it was held.
Impairment of long-lived assets
Impairment of long-lived assets, including right-of-use assets, was $63.6 million and nil for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. During the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, adverse changes in the business climate, including decreases in the price of Bitcoin throughout 2022 and the resulting decrease in the market price of miners and mining equipment, indicated that an impairment triggering event had occurred. Testing performed indicated that the estimated fair value of our miners, mining equipment, and other mining operation assets were less than their net carrying value. An impairment charge of approximately $63.6 million was recognized, decreasing the net carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair value.
Legal settlement
Legal settlement was $1.5 million and nil for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We filed a malpractice lawsuit in September 2021 as plaintiff. In April 2023, we settled the lawsuit for a gross amount of $3.1 million. In May 2023, we received approximately $1.5 million, net of legal fees.
Other income (expense)
Other income totaled $1.9 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 compared to an expense of $6.9 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022. The increase of $8.8 million was primarily driven by a $23.7 million gain on debt extinguishment, resulting from the settlement of our NYDIG debt of approximately $96.7 million. As part of the settlement and extinguishment, we exchanged assets from our site in Pecos, Texas and recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of approximately $23.7 million. The remaining increase of $6.1 million was related to the equity in earnings of the King Mountain JV, which was acquired in December 2022, partially offset by a $21.0 million increase in interest expense due to higher debt on our balance sheet.

Table of Contents
Income tax
Income tax benefit was $1.2 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 compared to an income tax expense of $5.1 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022. The increase in income tax benefit was primarily due to taxable loss for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 compared to taxable income in the prior year period.
King Mountain JV 
The King Mountain JV is a 50/50 joint venture with one of the world’s largest renewable energy producers. The King Mountain JV has 280 MW of self-mining and hosting operations located behind-the-meter at a wind farm in McCamey, Texas.
As of December 31, 2024, the King Mountain JV owned approximately 18,000 miners for self-mining (about 1.8EH/s) and hosted approximately 68,200 miners (about 7.7 EH/s) for a single hosting customer at its wholly-owned King Mountain site, which has a total capacity of 280 MW.   
We account for the King Mountain JV using the equity method of accounting, resulting in reporting the King Mountain JV as an unconsolidated joint venture. Additionally, our 50% portion of any distributions from the King Mountain JV are used to pay down the TZRC Secured Promissory Note. See Note 10. 
Investment in unconsolidated joint venture
 and Note 15.

Our Board and management team also evaluate Adjusted EBITDA for the King Mountain JV, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, and interest income. We use Adjusted EBITDA to assess the King Mountain JV’s financial performance because it allows us to compare the operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of the King Mountain JV’s capital structure. 
​

Table of Contents
Net income (loss) is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in such presentation. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. There can be no assurance that we will not modify the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA in the future, and any such modification may be material. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of this non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
Our primary sources of liquidity include our cash, our strategic Bitcoin reserve, our equity sales, and the cash flows generated from our operations. Historically, our primary cash needs have been for working capital to support equipment financing, including the purchase of additional Bitcoin miners, growth initiatives, including infrastructure purchases, development opportunities, and acquisitions. 
In 2024, we issued a $150.0 million convertible note to Coatue and drew an additional $15.0 million under our Coinbase loan. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we also made the strategic decision to retain the Bitcoin we mined in our operations rather than auto-liquidate, and purchased additional Bitcoin to bolster our strategic Bitcoin reserve.
On December 4, 2024, we entered into a Controlled Equity Offering Sales Agreement establishing the 2024 ATM, allowing us to offer and sell up to $500.0 million of our common stock from time to time. Concurrently, we launched a $250.0 million stock repurchase program enabling us to repurchase up to 4,683,936 shares of our common stock (representing 5.0% of our issued and outstanding common stock as of December 4, 2024) within twelve months of launch. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, we issued and sold 5,553,458 shares of our common stock under the 2024 ATM for gross proceeds of $165.2 million, incurred issuance costs of $3.2 million, and repurchased nil shares of our common stock under the stock repurchase program.
Our ability to meet our anticipated cash requirements will depend on various factors including our ability to maintain our existing business, enter into new lines of business, provide new offerings, compete with existing and new competitors in existing and new markets and offerings, acquire new businesses or pursue strategic transactions, and respond to global and domestic economic, geopolitical, social conditions and their impact on demand for our offerings.
We believe that cash flows generated from operating activities, our strategic Bitcoin reserve, and the 2024 ATM will meet our anticipated cash requirements in the short-term. On a long-term basis, we would rely on access to the capital markets for any long-term funding not provided by operating cash flows, cash on hand, and our strategic Bitcoin reserve.

Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities was $68.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, resulting from net income of $331.4 million, offset by adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash (used in) provided by operating activities of $385.5 million and changes in assets and liabilities of $14.4 million. Net cash used in operating activities was $22.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, resulting from net income of $21.9 million, and offset by non-cash adjustments of $52.4 million. 
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities totaled $188.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, primarily consisting of $124.0 million in property and equipment purchases, $100.7 million in Bitcoin purchases for our strategic reserve, and a $39.6 million deposit for acquiring miners and mining equipment. These outflows were partially offset by $74.5 million in proceeds from Bitcoin sales. Net cash provided by investing activities totaled $87.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, primarily consisting of $65.7 million in proceeds from Bitcoin sales, $23.0 million in cash acquired from the Business Combination, and $0.8 million from the sale of property and equipment. These inflows were partially offset by $1.5 million in property and equipment purchases and a $1.0 million cash deposit for miners.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $311.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, primarily consisting of $150.0 million in proceeds from notes payable, $162.0 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock through our 2024 ATM, and $22.2 million in proceeds from covered call options premiums. These inflows were partially offset by $36.8 million in loan repayments. Net cash used in financing activities was $40.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, primarily consisting of $39.6 million in repayments of loans payable and $1.2 million in debt issuance costs paid.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, contingent assets and liabilities, each as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the periods presented. On an ongoing basis, our management evaluates these estimates and assumptions, and the effects of any such revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which they are determined to be necessary. Actual outcomes could differ materially from those estimates in a manner that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. Set forth below are the policies and estimates that we have identified as critical to our business operations and understanding our results of operations, based on the high degree of judgment utilized or complexity in their application.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2. 
Basis of Presentation, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements
 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report, we believe the following accounting policies and estimates to be the most critical to fully understand and evaluate this management discussion and analysis:
●
use of estimates;
●
digital assets;
●
revenue from contracts with customers;
●
impairment of long-lived assets;
●
investment in equity investees;
●
finite-lived intangible assets; and
●
stock based compensation expense
74

Table of Contents
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates associated with revenue recognition, determining the useful lives and recoverability of long-lived assets, impairment analysis of finite-lived intangibles and digital assets, and current and deferred income tax assets (including the associated valuation allowance) and liabilities.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Market Price Risk of Bitcoin
We hold a significant amount of Bitcoin; therefore, we are exposed to the impact of market price changes in Bitcoin. As of December 31, 2024, we held 10,171 Bitcoin. The fair value of a single Bitcoin was approximately $93,354 as of December 31, 2024; therefore, the fair value of our Bitcoin holdings as of December 31, 2024 was approximately $949.5 million. Declines in the fair market value of Bitcoin will impact the cash value that would be realized if we were to sell our Bitcoin for cash, therefore having a negative impact on our liquidity.
Custodian Risk
Our Bitcoin is held with third-party custodians, Coinbase Custody, NYDIG, and BitGo, which we select based on various factors, including their financial strength and industry reputation. Custodian risk refers to the potential loss, theft, or misappropriation of our Bitcoin assets due to operational failures, cybersecurity breaches, or financial difficulties experienced by these third parties. Although we periodically monitor the financial health, insurance coverage, and security measures of our custodians, reliance on such third parties inherently exposes us to risks that we cannot fully mitigate. 
Credit Risk
Credit risk arises from our practice of pledging Bitcoin as collateral in transactions with counterparties. We mitigate this risk by engaging with counterparties that we believe possess strong creditworthiness based on their size, credit quality, and reputation, among other factors. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, we have not incurred any material loss from such transactions. However, there remains a risk that a counterparty could default on its obligations to us, which might result in a material loss. We continually assess the credit risk associated with our counterparties and, if necessary, recognize a loss provision or write-down. Credit risk also arises from us placing our cash and demand deposits in financial institutions. Although we strive to limit our exposure by placing cash and demand deposits with financial institutions with a high credit standing, there can be no assurances that we are able to mitigate our credit risk.
Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. 
We have two loans that maintain a variable interest rate. The first is the TZRC Secured Promissory Note, which includes a maximum interest rate of 15.25%. The second is the Coinbase credit facility, which bears interest at a rate of 5.0% plus the greater of (i) the US Federal Funds Target Rate – Upper Bound and (ii) 3.25%. As a result, changes in market interest rates could affect our operations over certain periods and may also impact our ability to finance projects. For more information regarding the TZRC Secured Promissory Note and Coinbase credit facility, see Note 15. 
Loans and notes payable
 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 
In addition, our exposure to interest rate risk relates to our ability to earn interest income on cash balances at variable rates. Changes in short term interest rates are not expected to have a significant effect on the fair value of our cash account.

Opinion on the Financial Statements
​
We have audited, before the effects of the adjustments to retrospectively apply the changes in Hut 8 Corp.’s (formerly known as U.S. Data Mining Group, Inc. and subsidiaries) (the Company) consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity, disclosures about segments and related information in Note 5, stockholders’ equity and related information in Note 18, stock-based compensation and related information in Note 19 and net income (loss) per share of common stock and related information in Note 20, the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements). The 2023 and 2022 financial statements before the effects of the adjustments described in Note 5, Note 18, Note 19 and Note 20 (collectively “the Adjustments”) are not presented herein. In our opinion, before the effects of the Adjustments to retrospectively restate the financial statements, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

​
We were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to retrospectively apply the Adjustments and, accordingly we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance about whether such Adjustments are appropriate and have been properly applied. Those adjustments were audited by other auditors.

Basis for Opinion
​
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

​
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.

​
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Hut 8 Corp.
Opinion on the financial statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hut 8 Corp. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and for the six months ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and for the six months ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), and our report dated February 28, 2025 expressed an adverse opinion.
We also have audited the adjustments to the June 30, 2023 and 2022 financial statements to retrospectively apply the changes to the segment information in the disclosures about segments and related information in Note 5, and the changes related to the recapitalization of equity structure pursuant to the business combination in the stockholders’ equity and stock-based compensation and related information in Note 18, Note 19 and Note 20. In our opinion, such adjustments are appropriate and have been properly applied. We were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the financial statements of the Company as at June 30, 2023 and 2022 other than with respect to the adjustments and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on financial statements as at June 30, 2023 and 2022 taken as a whole.
Basis for opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical audit matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
Digital assets mining revenue
As described further in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue under ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The digital assets mining revenue is derived from the service of performing hash computations for mining pools. The Company has entered into arrangements with mining pool operators to perform hash computations for the mining pools. In exchange for providing hash computation services, the Company is entitled to non-cash consideration in the form of digital assets calculated under payout models determined by the mining pool operators.
The principal considerations for our determination that the digital assets mining revenue is a critical audit matter are due to the significant judgment in the determination of how existing accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America should be applied in the accounting for and disclosure of digital assets mining revenue and complexities involved in auditing completeness, occurrence and accuracy of the revenue recognized. Given these considerations, the related audit effort in evaluating management’s judgments was extensive and required a high degree of auditor judgment.
Our audit procedures related to digital assets mining revenue included the following, among others:
–
 We evaluated management’s rationale for the application of ASC Topic 606 to account for its digital assets received, which included evaluating the provisions of the contract between the Company and the mining pools;
–
 We assessed the adequacy of the Company’s disclosures in the financial statements about digital assets mining revenue;
–
 We conducted substantive analytical procedures, with a high degree of precision, which include tests of the accuracy and completeness of the underlying data, such as confirmation of certain data with third parties;
–
 We tested digital assets received directly to the blockchain using our own node and the corresponding cash settlement using the third-party exchange data and the Company’s bank statements.
Existence and rights and obligations of digital assets
As described further in Note 7 to the financial statements, digital assets are either held in segregated custody accounts for the benefit of the Company, held in segregated custody accounts under the Company’s ownership and pledged as collateral under a borrowing arrangement or in connection with covered call options sold, or held by a third party for the Bitcoin pledged in connection with a Purchase Agreement for miner purchases.
The principal considerations for our determination that digital assets are a critical audit matter are due to the complexities involved in auditing existence and rights and obligations of the digital assets recognized. Given these considerations, the related audit effort in evaluating management’s judgments was extensive and required a high degree of auditor judgment.
80

Table of Contents
Our audit procedures related to the Company’s existence and rights and obligations of digital assets included the following, among others:
−
 We assigned professionals with specialized skills in blockchain, digital assets and cryptography;
−
 We tested the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls related to the existence and rights and obligations of digital assets, including customer key management by obtaining and evaluating the report attesting that those controls at the service organizations (custodians) are operating effectively;
−
 We obtained confirmation on digital assets with third parties.
Business combination
As described further in Note 3, on February 15, 2024, Far North Power Corp., a joint venture in which the Company holds an 80.1% interest, acquired four natural gas power plants in Canada. The Company recorded the transaction as a business combination using the acquisition method, with the assets and liabilities of the power plants recorded at their estimated fair values, resulting in a gain on bargain purchase.
Significant estimates and assumptions were made by management with regards to the fair values of assets and liabilities recorded upon the acquisition. This matter required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s assumptions on the economic obsolescence for the  tangible assets based on the orderly liquidation value, including the need to involve our valuation specialists.
Our audit procedures related to business combination included the following, among others:
−
 We utilized valuation specialists to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s valuation methodology;
−
 We tested the fair values of the assets and liabilities included upon the acquisition;
−
 We tested the mathematical accuracy of calculations;
−
 We assessed the consistency of the assumptions used with other accounting estimates.

Report of Independent Registered

Board of Directors and Shareholders
Hut 8 Corp.
Opinion on internal control over financial reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Hut 8 Corp. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in the 2013 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weaknesses described in the following paragraphs on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in the 2013 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework
 issued by COSO.
A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weaknesses have been identified and included in management’s assessment. 
●
The control pertaining to the review was not operating effectively as it relates to the calculation of the deferred tax provision for Bitcoin held in an international jurisdiction; and
●
The control pertaining to the review of a complex accounting transaction related to the Company’s BITMAIN miner purchase agreement was not operating effectively. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024. The material weaknesses identified above were considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2024 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated February 28, 2025 which expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.  
Basis 
for
 opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
Other information
We do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on Management’s Plan for Remediation.

Note 1. Organization
Nature of operations and corporate information
Hut 8 Corp. (together with its subsidiaries, the “Company” or “Hut 8”) is an energy infrastructure platform that integrates Power, Digital Infrastructure, and Compute at scale to fuel next-generation, energy-intensive use cases such as Bitcoin mining and high-performance computing (“HPC”) across North America. The Company was incorporated in Delaware in January 2023. The Company acquires, designs, builds, manages, and operates data centers that power these energy-intensive workloads. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s total energy capacity under management was 1,020 MW across fifteen sites: 665 MW across five Bitcoin mining sites in North America, 310 MW across four natural gas power generation facilities in Canada, 3 MW across five cloud and colocation data centers in Canada, and 42 MW at a non-operational site in Canada. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, the Company also brought online 1,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs for its GPU-as-a-Service business under its wholly owned subsidiary, Highrise AI, Inc.
Business combination 
On November 30, 2023, U.S. Data Mining Group, Inc. dba US Bitcoin Corp, a Nevada corporation doing business as “US BITCOIN” (“USBTC”), and Hut 8 Mining Corp., a corporation existing under the laws of British Columbia (“Legacy Hut”), combined their business pursuant to a business combination agreement (“the Business Combination Agreement”) signed on February 6, 2023 by becoming wholly owned subsidiaries of a newly formed U.S. domiciled parent entity, named “Hut 8 Corp.” The transaction (the “Business Combination”) was accounted for under the acquisition method with USBTC identified as the accounting acquirer for financial statement reporting purposes.
In connection with the Business Combination, USTBC changed its fiscal year end to December 31 from June 30, effective November 30, 2023. As a result, the Company’s results of operations, and all transactions impacting stockholders’ equity presented in this Annual Report for the 2023 comparative period are for the six months ended December 31, 2023, whereas its fiscal year 2023 and 2022 are for the twelve months ended June 30, unless otherwise noted. The results for the six months ended December 31, 2023 consist of 5 months of financial information for USBTC from July to November 2023, and 1 month of financial information for the combined company for December 2023. The results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 consist of a full year for the combined company.

Note 2. Basis of presentation, summary of significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements
Basis of presentation 
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United Stated of America (“GAAP”).
The U.S. Dollar is the functional and presentation currency of the Company.
Significant accounting policies followed by the Company in the preparation of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements are summarized below.
Principles of consolidation
These Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company include the accounts of the Company and its controlled subsidiaries. Consolidated subsidiaries’ results are included from the date the subsidiary was formed or acquired. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Unconsolidated investments in which the Company does not have a controlling interest but does have significant influence are accounted for as equity method investments, with earnings recorded in other expense. These investments are included in long-term assets and the Company’s proportionate share of income or loss is included in other expense.

Reclassifications
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. The Company believes that the reclassifications did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. The impact on any prior period disclosures was immaterial.
Recent accounting pronouncements
The Company continually assesses any new accounting pronouncements to determine their applicability. When it is determined that a new accounting pronouncement affects the Company’s financial reporting, the Company undertakes a study to determine the consequences of the change to its Consolidated Financial Statements and ensures that there are proper controls in place to ascertain that the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements properly reflect the change.
In November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Update ASU 2024-03, 
Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses 
(“ASU 2024-03”). ASU 2024-03 requires public business entities to provide additional disclosures in the notes to financial statements, disaggregating specific expense categories within relevant income statement captions. The prescribed categories include purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, intangible asset amortization, and depreciation, depletion, and amortization related to oil-and-gas producing activities. ASU 2024-03 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the standard.
In December 2023, FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
 (“ASU 2023-09”). ASU 2023-09 expands existing income tax disclosures (1) for rate reconciliations by requiring disclosure of certain specific categories and additional reconciling items that meet quantitative thresholds and (2) for income taxes paid by requiring disaggregation by certain jurisdictions. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024; early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the standard.
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
 (“ASU 2023-07”). ASU 2023-07 is intended to enhance reportable segment disclosures by requiring disclosures of significant segment expenses regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”), the title and position of the CODM, and an explanation of how the reported measures of segment profit and loss are used by the CODM in assessing segment performance and allocation of resources. ASU 2023-07 is effective for the Company for annual periods beginning after December 31, 2023; early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 for our annual period beginning January 1, 2024 on a retrospective basis to all periods presented. Refer to Note 5. 
Segment Information
.
On August 23, 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-05, 
Business Combinations - Joint Venture Formations (Subtopic 805-60): Recognition and Initial Measurement
 (“ASU 2023-05”). ASU 2023-05 addresses the accounting for contributions made to a joint venture and requires contributions received by a joint venture to be measured at fair value upon formation. ASU 2023-05 is designed to provide useful information to investors and reduce diversity in accounting practice. The new standard is effective for the Company for its fiscal year beginning January 1, 2025; early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the standard.

Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements include estimates associated with revenue recognition, determining the useful lives and recoverability of long-lived assets, impairment analysis of finite-lived intangibles,  goodwill and digital assets, stock-based compensation, and current and deferred income tax assets (including the associated valuation allowance) and liabilities.
Change in estimates
During the quarter ended March 31, 2024, management performed an operational efficiency review of its mining equipment which considered the anticipated impact of the Bitcoin network Halving that occurred in April 2024. The outcome was a change in the expected useful life of the Company’s MicroBT M31S and M31S+ miners and Canaan Avalon miners. The mining equipment was originally estimated to have a useful life of 
four years
 from the date the mining equipment was put into service. After the operational efficiency review, the mining equipment was estimated to have a useful life of 
five months
 as of January 1, 2024. The result is a change in estimate, which was applied prospectively. Notwithstanding any future addition to the mining equipment of the same models, the effect of the change in useful life on actual and expected depreciation expense, effective the quarter ended March 31, 2024, is as follows:

Cash
Cash includes cash on hand and demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions, which are unrestricted as to withdrawal or use. The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had 
no
 cash equivalents. Periodically, the Company may maintain deposits in financial institutions in excess of government insured limits. Management believes that the Company is not exposed to significant credit risk as the Company’s deposits are held at financial institutions that management believes to be of high credit quality. To date, the Company has not experienced any losses on these deposits.
Restricted cash
Restricted cash as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 principally represented those cash balances that support commercial letters of credit and are restricted from withdrawal. 
Accounts receivable
Accounts receivable consist of amounts due from the Company’s Power, Digital Infrastructure, and Compute customers. The Company records accounts receivable at the invoiced amount less an allowance for any potentially uncollectable accounts under the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) impairment model and presents the net amount of the financial instrument expected to be collected. The CECL impairment model requires an estimate of expected credit losses, measured over the contractual life of an instrument, that considers forecasts of future economic conditions in addition to information about past events and current conditions. Based on this model, the Company considers many factors, including the age of the balance, collection history, and current economic trends. Bad debts are written off after all collection efforts have ceased.

Table of Contents
Allowances for credit losses are recorded as a direct reduction from an asset’s amortized cost basis. Credit losses are recorded in 
General and administrative expenses
 in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).
Based on the Company’s current and historical collection experience, management recorded allowances for doubtful accounts of $
0.2
 million, and $
0.1
 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.
Fair value measurement
The Company’s financial assets and liabilities are accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 820,
 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
 (“ASC 820”) which defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs when measuring fair value and classifies those inputs into three levels:
Level 1— Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2— Observable, market-based inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, for the assets or liabilities either directly or indirectly.
Level 3—Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.
Observable inputs are based on market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs are based on the Company’s market assumptions. Unobservable inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. In some cases, the inputs used to measure an asset or a liability may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those instances, the fair value measurement is required to be classified using the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Such determination requires significant management judgment. 
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis
The following table presents information about the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and the Company’s estimated level within the fair value hierarchy of those assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:

Table of Contents
In determining the fair value of its digital assets, the Company uses quoted prices as determined by the Company’s principal market, which is Coinbase Prime. As such, the Company’s digital assets were determined to be Level 1 assets. See 
Digital assets
 below for a description of the Company’s digital asset accounting policy. In estimating the fair value of its covered call options, the Company uses the Black-Scholes pricing model, which includes several inputs and assumptions including the market price of the underlying asset (Bitcoin), the underlying asset’s implied volatility, the risk-free interest rate, and the expected term of the options. The expected term of the options is the contractual term of the options given the options can only be exercised on the expiry date. The Company determined that the covered call options are Level 2 liabilities given all inputs are observable, but the options themselves are not traded in an active market. The Company estimates the fair value of its separated embedded derivative from convertible note using the partial differential equation model (“PDE Model”), which includes several inputs and assumptions including the Company’s common stock price at the time of valuation, the implied volatility of the Company’s common stock matching the moneyness of the conversion option, the risk-free interest rate curve, and the credit spread. In addition, management’s assumption of the probability of occurrence of the separated embedded derivative from the convertible note’s trigger event is a significant unobservable input. For quantitative disclosure on the inputs used to determine the fair value of the Company’s separated embedded derivative from convertible note, see Note 16. 
Derivatives
. The Company determined that the separated embedded derivative from convertible note is a Level 3 liability given significant unobservable inputs are included in its valuation. The Company estimates the fair value of its Bitcoin redemption option using the Black-Scholes pricing model, which includes several inputs and assumptions including the market price of the underlying asset (Bitcoin), the underlying asset’s implied volatility, the risk-free interest rate, and the expected term of the redemption option. In addition, management’s assumption of the start of the redemption period, triggered by a shipment date of purchased property and equipment, is a significant unobservable input. For quantitative disclosure on the inputs used to fair value the Company’s Bitcoin redemption option, see Note 16. 
Derivatives
. The Company determined that the Bitcoin redemption option is a Level 3 liability given a significant unobservable input is included in its valuation.
See the 
Derivatives
 below for a description of the Company’s derivative instrument accounting policy.
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis
In addition to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company also measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a non-recurring basis. The Company’s non-financial assets, including goodwill, intangible assets, operating lease right-of-use assets, and property and equipment, are measured at fair value when there is an indication of impairment and the carrying amount exceeds the asset’s projected undiscounted cash flows. These assets are recorded at fair value only when an impairment charge is recognized. The Company had 
nil
 impairment from its continuing operations related to its non-financial assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and six months ended December 31, 2023, respectively. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, the Company recognized impairment loss from its continuing operations of $
63.6
 million and 
nil
, respectively. The Company recognized approximately $
6.1
 million of impairment losses from its discontinued operations related to the Drumheller site’s non-financial assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024. There were 
no
 discontinued operations during the six months ended December 31, 2023 and twelve months ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022. See the Impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill accounting policy below, as well as Note 4. 
Discontinued operations
 for further discussion.
The carrying amounts of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying value of loans and notes payable and other long-term liabilities approximate fair value as the related interest rates approximate rates currently available to the Company except for the Company’s convertible note. See 
Derivatives
 and 
Convertible instruments
 below for a description of the Company’s derivative instrument accounting policy and convertible instrument accounting policy, respectively, and Note 15.

Digital assets
As a result of the adoption of 
ASU 2023-08, 
Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60): Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets 
(“ASU 2023-08”)
 on July 1, 2023, which was the beginning of the Company's fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, digital assets are measured at fair value as of each reporting period. The fair value of digital assets is measured using the period-end closing price from the Company’s principal market, which is Coinbase Prime, in accordance with ASC 820. Since the digital assets are traded on a 24-hour period, the Company utilizes the price as of midnight UTC time, which aligns with the Company’s Bitcoin mining revenue recognition cut-off. Changes in fair value are recognized in 
Gains on digital assets
, in 
Operating income (loss)
 on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). When the Company sells digital assets, gains or losses from such transactions are measured as the difference between the cash proceeds and the carrying basis of the digital assets as determined on a First In-First Out basis and are also recorded within the same line item 
Gains on digital assets
.
Prior to the adoption of ASU 2023-08, digital assets held were accounted for as intangible assets with an indefinite useful life. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life was not amortized but assessed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances occurred indicating that it was more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset was impaired, and at a minimum annually. The Company measured for impairment on a daily basis, determining the fair value of its digital assets by using the lowest intra-day price as determined by the Company’s principal market. The Company recognized impairment whenever, and to the extent, the carrying amount exceeded the lowest intra-day price. To the extent an impairment loss was recognized, the loss established the new cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment losses was not permitted.
Digital assets received by the Company through its revenue activities are accounted for in connection with the Company’s revenue recognition policy disclosed below.
During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company made the strategic decision to change its approach towards its strategic treasury policy, retaining all Bitcoin mined in its operations to increase its Bitcoin holdings. As a result of its intent to hold on to its Bitcoin, the Company began classifying its digital assets held as a non-current asset on its Consolidated Balance Sheet, except for certain specific use cases. Decisions to utilize the Bitcoin will be made on a case-by-case basis. The Company has classified certain digital assets as current on its Consolidated Balance Sheets in connection with the Bitcoin it purchased and subsequently pledged to BITMAIN in connection with a Future Sales and Purchase Agreement, as amended (the “BITMAIN Purchase Agreement”) to acquire ASIC miners.
Investment in equity investees
The Company accounts for its investment in equity investees in accordance with ASC Topic 323, 
Investments – Equity Method and Joint Ventures 
(“ASC 323”). The Company accounts for its investment in the joint venture, TZRC LLC (“TZRC”), under ASC 323 because it has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. See Note 10. 
Investment in unconsolidated joint venture
 for additional information on the equity method investment entity. Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if the Company has an ownership interest in the voting stock of an investee of between 20 percent and 50 percent, or an ownership interest greater than three to five percent in certain partnerships, unincorporated joint ventures and limited liability companies, although other factors are considered in determining whether the equity method of accounting is appropriate. Under this method, an investment in the unconsolidated investee is generally initially measured and recorded at cost.
94

Table of Contents
The Company recorded its investment in TZRC based upon the fair value of the consideration transferred which was determined to be its cost. The Company’s investment is subsequently adjusted to recognize its share of net income or losses as they occur. The Company also adjusts its investment upon receipt of a distribution from an equity investee, which is accounted for as a distribution-in-kind that is measured as of time of receipt. The Company’s share of the investees’ earnings or losses is recorded, net of taxes, within 
Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint venture
 on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). Additionally, the Company’s interest in the net assets of its equity method investee is reflected on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. If, upon the Company’s acquisition of the investment, there is any difference between the cost of the investment and the amount of the underlying equity in the net assets of the investee, the difference is required to be accounted for as if the investee were a consolidated subsidiary. If the difference is assigned to depreciable or amortizable assets or liabilities, then the difference should be amortized or accreted in connection with the equity earnings based on the Company’s proportionate share of the investee’s net income or loss. If the Company is unable to relate the difference to specific accounts of the investee, the difference should be considered goodwill.
The Company considers whether the fair value of its equity method investment has declined below its carrying value whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that recorded value may not be recoverable. If the Company considered any such decline to be other than temporary (based on various factors, including historical financial results, success of the mining operations and the overall health of the investee’s industry), then the Company would record a write-down to the estimated fair value. 
No
 impairment of the Company’s investment in TZRC was recorded for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, six months ended December 31, 2023, or twelve months ended June 30, 2023 or June 30, 2022, respectively.
Long-term investments
For equity investments, the Company initially records equity investments at cost then adjusts the carrying value of such equity investments through earnings when there is an observable transaction involving the same or a similar investment with the same issuer or upon an impairment.
On January 31, 2024, the Company entered into a contribution agreement (the “Contribution Agreement”) with Ionic Digital Inc. (“Ionic”), a company founded to effectuate the restructuring of certain mining assets of Celsius Network LLC (“Celsius”) in connection with Celsius’ bankruptcy auction. Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, on January 31, 2024, the Company acquired 
374,261
 shares of Ionic’s Class A common stock in exchange for a cash payment of $
6.4
 million.
Property and equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset, including those attributable to bringing the asset to its intended working condition. Construction in progress is not depreciated until the work is completed and the assets are placed in service.
95

Table of Contents
Based on the Company and the industry’s limited history to date, management is limited by the market data available. Furthermore, the data available also include data derived from the use of economic modelling to forecast future digital assets and the assumptions reflected in such forecasts, including digital assets price and network difficulty, as well as management assumptions, are inherently uncertain. Based on currently available data, management has determined that the straight-line method of depreciation best reflects the current expected useful life of mining equipment and related infrastructure. Management reviews estimates at each reporting date and will revise such estimates as and when data become available. Management reviews the appropriateness of its assumptions related to residual value at each reporting date. 
The estimated useful lives of the Company’s property and equipment are generally as follows:
​
​
​
​
​
​
Useful life (in years)

Upon the sale or retirement of property and equipment, the cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) in the relevant reporting period.
Mining equipment held for sale
The Company classifies long-lived assets to be sold as held for sale in the period in which all of the following criteria are met: (1) management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the asset; (2) the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets; (3) an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the asset have been initiated; (4) the sale of the asset is probable, and transfer of the asset is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year, except if events or circumstances beyond the Company’s control extend the period of time required to sell the asset beyond one year; (5) the asset is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and (6) actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. 
The Company initially measures long-lived assets that are classified as held for sale at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell. Any loss resulting from this measurement is recognized in the period in which the held-for-sale criteria are met. Conversely, gains are not recognized on the sale of long-lived assets until the date of sale. The Company assesses the fair value of a long-lived asset less any costs to sell in each reporting period it remains classified as held for sale and reports any subsequent changes as an adjustment to the carrying value of the asset, as long as the new carrying value does not exceed the carrying value of the asset at the time it was initially classified as held for sale. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, six months ended December 31, 2023, and twelve months ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, the Company has 
no
t recognized any impairment or gains on sales of its mining equipment held for sale.

Table of Contents
On December 18, 2023, the Company signed an interim agreement to build out and install mining operations in connection with the Celsius bankruptcy proceedings at a site in Cedarvale, Texas, in which the Company also made certain of its unused mining infrastructure available for sale. As of December 31, 2023, the Company determined that each of the above criteria to classify long-lived assets to be sold as held for sale were met, and reclassified the carrying value of these assets of $
3.9
 million to 
Equipment held for sale
. In February 2024, the Company sold $
2.0
 million of these assets. The Company sold the remaining assets in April 2024. As of December 31, 2024, the 
Equipment held for sale
 on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets was 
nil
.   
Impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill
The Company reviews long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets (or asset groups) may not be fully recoverable. The asset (or asset group) to be held and used that is subject to impairment review represents the lowest level of identifiable cash flows that is largely independent of other groups of assets and liabilities. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered unrecoverable, the impairment loss to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Factors the Company considers that could trigger an impairment include, but are not limited to, the following: significant changes in the manner of the Company’s use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the Company’s overall business, significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected development milestones, significant negative regulatory or economic trends, and significant technological changes that could render the asset (or asset group) obsolete. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values, and third-party independent appraisals, as necessary. When recognized, impairment losses related to long-lived assets to be held and used in operations are recorded as cost and expenses in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). For the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, six months ended December 31, 2023 and twelve months ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, there were 
nil

Finite-lived intangible assets
Intangible assets are comprised of customer relationships and a favorable contract acquired by the Company through a business combination, and rights to a property management agreement (“PMA”) under which it would be compensated for services of running TZRC’s operations. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life, which is their contractual term or estimated useful life. The Company performs assessments to determine whether the finite-lived classification is still appropriate at least annually. The carrying value of finite-lived assets and their remaining useful lives are also reviewed at least annually to determine if circumstances exist that indicate a potential impairment or revision to the amortization period. A finite-lived intangible asset is considered to be impaired if its carrying value exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from it. The Company exercises judgment in selecting the assumptions used in the estimated future undiscounted cash flows analysis. Impairment is measured by the amount that the carrying value exceeds fair value. The use of different estimates or assumptions could result in significantly different fair values for our reporting units and intangible assets.

The Company evaluates the useful lives of the intangible assets to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. The estimated useful lives of the Company’s finite-lived intangible assets are as follows:
​
​

​
Useful life (in years)

Goodwill
Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized and is reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered impaired and that excess is recognized as a goodwill impairment loss.
Leases
The Company accounts for its leases under ASC Topic 842, 
Leases 
(“ASC 842”). Under this guidance, arrangements meeting the definition of a lease are classified as operating or financing leases and are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as both a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, calculated by discounting fixed lease payments over the lease term at the rate implicit in the lease or the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Lease liabilities are increased by interest and reduced by payments each period, and the right-of-use asset is amortized over the lease term. For operating leases, interest on the lease liability and the amortization of the right-of-use asset result in straight-line rent expense over the lease term.
Upon adoption of ASC 842, for purposes of calculating the right-of-use asset and lease liability, the Company elected to combine lease and related non-lease components as permitted under ASC 842. The Company also elected the short-term lease exception for leases having an initial term of 12 months or less. Consequently, such leases are not recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company recognizes rent expense from its operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Derivatives
The Company accounts for the derivative contracts it enters into and the separated embedded derivative from convertible note as follows:
Bitcoin redemption option
The Company has entered into an agreement to purchase plant and equipment which includes a pledge of Bitcoin and right to redeem the pledged Bitcoin for a certain period after the redemption period starts. The redemption period starts when the purchased plant and equipment is shipped. The amount of Bitcoin that can be redeemed is pro-rata of the percentage of plant and equipment shipped. This Bitcoin redemption option does not qualify as an accounting hedge under FASB ASC Topic 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging
 (“ASC 815”). Accordingly, the Company carries the Bitcoin redemption option at fair value and any gains or losses are recognized in profit or loss, respectively.
Covered call options
From time to time, the Company sells options on Bitcoin that it owns (the “covered call options”). The Company sold covered call options during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 to generate cash flows on a portion of its Bitcoin held. These options do not qualify as accounting hedges under ASC 815. Accordingly, the Company carries the covered call options at fair value and any gains or losses are recognized in profit or loss, respectively.

Separated embedded derivative from convertible note
The Company evaluates and accounts for derivatives embedded in its convertible instruments in accordance with ASC 815.  Accordingly, the Company has assessed if embedded derivatives should be separated from its host contract and accounted for as a derivative instrument based on whether all three ASC 815 criteria are met: (1) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (2) the hybrid instrument is not remeasured at fair value under GAAP with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur, and (3) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would be a derivative instrument. ASC 815 also provides an exception to this rule when the host instrument is deemed to be a conventional convertible debt instrument as defined in the FASB ASC topic. The Company identified embedded derivatives in a convertible instrument it issued, including conversion options, other redemption features, and contingently exercisable options. The Company determined that the Contingent Repurchase Right (as defined in Note 15.
 Loans and notes payable
) in such convertible instrument is an embedded derivative that should be separated from its host contract and accounted for as a derivative instrument as per ASC 815. The conversion option is indexed to the Company’s common stock and meets the criteria for classification in stockholders’ equity, and therefore derivative accounting does not apply. The other embedded derivatives do not meet all three previously mentioned ASC 815 criteria, and therefore should not be separated from their host contract. The Company accounts for its separated embedded derivative as a derivative instrument that is carried at fair value and recognizes any gains or losses in profit or loss, respectively.
Convertible instruments
As noted above in the Company’s 
Derivatives
 accounting policy, various embedded derivatives were identified in a convertible instrument and were evaluated and accounted for in accordance with ASC 815. If an embedded derivative is separated from its host contract, the debt host contract is discounted by the initial fair value of the separated embedded derivative and is offset by issuance costs associated with the host contract. The Company accounts for its host contract, whose embedded derivative becomes separated, subsequently at amortized cost, and the discount and issuance costs are amortized to interest expense over the expected term of the host contract using the effective interest method.
Segment reporting
Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available and regularly reviewed by the CODM to make strategic decisions, allocate resources, and assess financial performance. The Company’s operating segments are aggregated into reportable segments only if they exhibit similar economic characteristics and have similar business activities. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) serves as the CODM, responsible for strategic decisions regarding operations and financial management. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has 
four
 reportable segments, each evaluated separately by the CODM: Power, Digital Infrastructure, Compute, and Other. The Company changed its reportable segments during the year ended December 31, 2024 to better align with the Company’s objectives; accordingly, the comparative results were recast to align with the new reportable segments. The previous reportable segments were as follows: Digital Asset Mining, Managed Services, High Performance Computing – Colocation and Cloud, and Other. The CODM uses revenue and cost of revenue of the Company’s 
four
 reportable segments to assess their performance. The CODM does not evaluate performance or allocate resources based on segment asset or liability information.
​
Revenue recognition
The Company recognizes revenue under ASC Topic 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
(“ASC 606”). The core principle of this standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle:
●
Step 1: Identify the contract with the customer
●
Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract
●
Step 3: Determine the transaction price
●
Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
99

Table of Contents
●
Step 5: Recognize revenue when the company satisfies a performance obligation
In order to identify the performance obligations in a contract with a customer, a company must assess the promised goods or services in the contract and identify each promised good or service that is distinct. A performance obligation meets ASC 606’s definition of a “distinct” good or service (or bundle of goods or services) if both of the following criteria are met: (1) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (i.e., the good or service is capable of being distinct), and (2) the entity’s promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (i.e., the promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of the contract).
If a good or service is not distinct, the good or service is combined with other promised goods or services until a bundle of goods or services is identified that is distinct.
The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer. The consideration promised in a contract with a customer may include fixed amounts, variable amounts, or both. When determining the transaction price, an entity must consider the effects of all of the following:
●
Variable consideration
●
Constraining estimates of variable consideration
●
The existence of a significant financing component in the contract
●
Noncash consideration
●
Consideration payable to a customer
Variable consideration is included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. The transaction price allocated to each performance obligation is recognized when that performance obligation is satisfied, at a point in time or over time as appropriate.
Power
The Power business segment consists of revenue streams related to Managed Services and Power Generation. 
Power Generation
The Company generates revenue by providing capacity and energy to the electrical grid through its 
four
 natural gas power plants in Ontario, Canada, owned by the Company’s consolidated subsidiary, Far North Power Corp. (the “Far North JV”), and its respective subsidiaries. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for services, net of discounts and applicable taxes. The Company applies the five-step ASC 606 model in determining the appropriate treatment of its revenue sources. The principal sources of revenue and the recognition of these revenues are as follows:
●
Capacity revenue is recognized over time as the Company satisfies its performance obligation by making its power generation capacity available to the grid. This revenue is recorded ratably over the enforceable contract period, consistent with industry practice to measure satisfaction through the passage of time.
●
Electricity sales revenue is recognized at the point in time when control of the electricity is transferred to the grid operator, based on the market price of electricity at the time of delivery. This revenue is subject to variable consideration due to fluctuations in electricity demand, market generation capacity, and the prevailing price of natural gas. The Company estimates variable consideration in accordance with ASC 606 to ensure revenue is not overstated.
●
Transaction price is determined based on contractual rates for capacity sales and the market price for electricity sales, adjusted for any applicable incentives, penalties, or other forms of variable consideration.
100

Table of Contents
●
Principal versus agent consideration is evaluated for each transaction to determine whether the Company controls the electricity before it is transferred to the customer. Generally, the Company is the principal in these transactions and records revenue on a gross basis. However, for certain contracts where the Company does not have primary responsibility for pricing or delivery risks, revenue may be recognized on a net basis.
●
Invoices for capacity revenue are typically issued based on contractual billing terms, while electricity sales revenue is recorded based on metered usage and settled periodically according to market clearing processes.
Managed Services
The Company began providing management services for the customer’s data centers under PMAs in November 2022. PMAs contain a single performance obligation comprised of a series of distinct monthly service periods. The contracts have an initial term ranging from 
four
 to 
ten years
; certain contracts include renewal options. In exchange for the provision of the services, the Company is entitled to variable consideration primarily in the form of a fixed monthly management fee based on capacity of the customer’s data centers, plus the reimbursement of certain operating costs, including power, which vary each month. The Company acts as the principal when incurring costs, which are reimbursed by our customers. For some PMAs in which the customer provides hosting services, the Company may also be entitled to a share of additional hosting services business the Company helps generate for the customer. The variable fees are attributable to the monthly service periods in the contract. Consideration to which the Company is entitled is in the form of cash, and for one of the Company's former contracts the Company also received noncash consideration in the form of equity of the customer. This noncash consideration is measured at fair value at contract inception. The Company recognizes revenue to the extent that a significant reversal of such revenue will not occur. Revenue is recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the Company’s performance. To the extent the Company provides services before the noncash consideration is due, the Company presents this noncash consideration as a contract asset, and assesses the contract asset for impairment each reporting period. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 the Company recorded $
4.5
 million of impairment related to this contract asset. 
Digital Infrastructure
The Digital Infrastructure business segment consist of revenue streams related to CPU Colocation and ASIC Colocation services. 
CPU Colocation
The colocation business earns revenue by providing colocation services to customers. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for services, net of discounts, and sales taxes. Revenue is recognized as the related services are provided to customers. The Company applies the five step ASC 606 model in determining the appropriate treatment of its various sources of revenue. The principal sources of revenue to the Company and recognition of these revenues are as follows:
●
Monthly recurring revenue (“MRR”) from colocation services are recognized as service revenue ratably over the enforceable term of individual contracts which is typically the stated term. The Company satisfies its performance obligation as these services are made available over time. The Company believes this method to be the best representation of transfer of services as it is consistent with industry practice to measure satisfaction through passage of time. Invoices are typically issued at the beginning of each month for MRR services.
●
Transaction price is determined as the list price of services, net of discounts, that the Company delivers to its customers, taking into account the term of each individual contract and the ability to enforce and collect the consideration.
●
Revenue from installation services, which are not treated as distinct performance obligations, are recognized over the enforceable term of individual contracts consistent with the schedule of MRR discussed above.

Table of Contents
ASIC Colocation
The Company has also entered into hosting contracts where it operates mining equipment on behalf of third parties within its facilities. The Company’s hosting contracts are service contracts that contain a single performance obligation. The service the Company provides may include the provision of mining equipment, energized space, and monitoring, active troubleshooting, and various maintenance levels for the mining equipment.
Consideration to which the Company is entitled under its hosting services agreements can be cash and, in some cases, noncash (Bitcoin) in contracts where the Company receives a percentage of the customer’s daily Bitcoin mined. These contracts may be terminable at any time by either party without substantive compensation to the other party for such termination. Therefore, the Company has determined that the duration of these contracts is less than 24 hours and that the contract continuously renews throughout the day. Upon termination, the customer is required to pay the Company any amount due related to previously satisfied performance obligations. The Company has determined that the customer’s renewal right is not a material right as the terms, conditions, and compensation amounts are at then market rates.
In contracts in which the Company receives noncash consideration, the Company measures noncash consideration at the Bitcoin spot price at the beginning of the day UTC on the date of contract inception, as determined by the Company’s principal market, which is Coinbase Prime. The Company recognizes this noncash consideration on the same day that control of the contracted service transfers to the customer, which is the same day as the contract inception.
Customer contracts can include advance payment terms in the form of monthly cash prepayments and/or upfront cash payments at contract inception. Advance payments are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over time (generally, the month of hosting service to which they relate) as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the Company’s performance. There is no significant financing component in these transactions due to the short-term nature of the payments.
The Company’s hosting contracts can contain service level agreement clauses, which guarantee a certain percentage of time the power will be available to its customer. In the rare case that the Company may incur penalties under these clauses, the Company recognizes the payment as variable consideration and a reduction of the transaction price and, therefore, of revenue, when not in exchange for a good or service from the customer.
Compute
The Compute business segment consists of revenue streams related to Bitcoin Mining, GPU-as-a-Service, and Data Center Cloud operations.
Bitcoin Mining
Currently, one of the Company’s largest revenue streams is derived from Bitcoin Mining (also referred to as self-mining). The Company has entered into arrangements, as amended from time to time, with mining pool operators to perform hash computations for the mining pools, which is an output of the Company’s ordinary activities. The Company has the right to decide the point in time and duration for which it will provide hash computation services to the mining pools. As a result, the Company’s enforceable right to compensation only begins when, and continues as long as, the Company provides hash computation services to the mining pools. The contracts are terminable at any time by either party without substantive compensation to the other party for such termination. Therefore, the Company has determined that the duration of the contract is less than 24 hours and that the contract continuously renews throughout the day. Upon termination, the mining pool operator (i.e., the customer) is required to pay the Company any amount due related to previously satisfied performance obligations. The Company has determined that the mining pool operator’s (i.e., the customer’s) renewal right is not a material right as the terms, conditions, and compensation amounts are at then market rates. There is no significant financing component in these transactions.

Table of Contents
In exchange for providing hash computation services, which represents the Company’s only performance obligation, the Company is entitled to noncash consideration in the form of Bitcoin, calculated under payout models determined by the mining pool operators. The payout model used by the mining pools in which the Company participated is the Full Pay Per Share (“FPPS”) model, which contains three components, (1) a fractional share of the fixed Bitcoin award from the mining pool operator (referred to as a “block reward”), (2) transaction fees generated from (paid by) blockchain users to execute transactions and distributed (paid out) to individual miners by the mining pool operator, and (3) mining pool operating fees retained by the mining pool operator for operating the mining pool. The Company’s total compensation is calculated using the following formula: the sum of the Company’s share of (a) block rewards and (b) transaction fees, less (c) mining pool operating fees. The following is a detailed description of each of the components of the FPPS model under which the Company receives payment from the mining pools in which it participates:
(1)
Block rewards represent the Company’s share of the total amount of block subsidies that are expected to be generated on the Bitcoin network as a whole during the 24-hour period beginning at midnight UTC daily (the “measurement period”). The block reward earned by the Company is calculated by dividing (a) the total amount of hashrate the Company provides to the mining pool operator, by (b) the total Bitcoin network’s implied hashrate (as determined by the Bitcoin network difficulty), multiplied by (c) the total amount of block subsidies that are expected to be generated on the Bitcoin network as a whole during the measurement period. The Company is entitled to its relative share of consideration even if a block is not successfully added to the blockchain by the mining pool in the measurement period.
(2)
Transaction fees refer to the total fees paid by users of the network to execute transactions. The Company is entitled to a pro-rata share of the total amount of transaction fees that are actually generated on the Bitcoin network as a whole during the measurement period. The transaction fees paid out by the mining pool operator to the Company is calculated by dividing (a) the total amount of transaction fees that are actually generated on the Bitcoin network as a whole, by (b) the total amount of block subsidies that are actually generated on the Bitcoin network as a whole, multiplied by (c) the Company’s block rewards earned as calculated in (1) above. The Company is entitled to its relative share of consideration even if a block is not successfully added to the blockchain by the mining pool in the measurement period.
(3)
Mining pool operating fees are charged by the mining pool operator for operating the mining pool as set forth on a rate schedule to the mining pool contract. The mining pool operating fees reduce the total amount of compensation the Company receives and are only incurred to the extent that the Company has generated mining revenue during the measurement period.
For each contract, the Company measures noncash consideration at the Bitcoin spot price at the beginning of the day (midnight UTC time) on the date of contract inception, as determined by the Company’s principal market, which is Coinbase Prime. The Company recognizes this noncash consideration on the same day that control of the contracted service transfers to the mining pool operator, which is the same day as the contract inception.
GPU-as-a-Service
The Company launched a GPU-as-a-Service offering as its inaugural GPU cluster came online in September 2024. The Company has entered into a contract with an AI cloud services provider pursuant to which the provider pays the Company a fixed infrastructure fee and a share of its revenues from the sale of its services at the cluster. The Company applies the five step ASC 606 model in determining the appropriate treatment of its GPU-as-a-Service revenue. The performance obligation by the Company is to provide certain compute hosting services as outlined in the contract with the customer and also making available the compute power required by the customer for their services. The Company satisfies its performance obligation over the term of the contract as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the services provided the Company.

Data Center Cloud
The Company earns revenue by providing cloud services to clients. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for services, net of discounts and sales taxes. Revenue is recognized as the related services are provided to customers. The Company applies the five step ASC 606 model in determining the appropriate treatment of its various sources of revenue. The principal sources of revenue to the Company and recognition of these revenues are as follows:
●
MRR from cloud services are recognized as service revenue ratably over the enforceable term of individual contracts which is typically the stated term. The Company satisfies its performance obligation as these services are made available over time. The Company believes this method to be the best representation of transfer of services as it is consistent with industry practice to measure satisfaction through passage of time. Invoices are typically issued at the beginning of each month for MRR services. 
●
Transaction price is determined as the list price of services, net of discounts, that the Company delivers to its customers, taking into account the term of each individual contract and the ability to enforce and collect the consideration.
●
Revenue from installation services, which are not treated as distinct performance obligations, are recognized over the enforceable term of individual contracts consistent with the schedule of MRR discussed above.
●
Usage revenue (overage and consumption-based services) is recorded as service revenue in the month the usage is incurred/service is consumed by the customer, based on a fixed agreed upon fee per unit consumed. Invoices are typically issued at the end of each month for usage revenue.
Other
The Other business segments consists of revenue related to Equipment Sales and Repairs. 
Equipment Sales and Repairs
Mining equipment sales contracts are for a fixed price and do not include a significant financing component. All consideration to which the Company is entitled is in the form of cash. The Company recognizes mining equipment sales revenue at a point in time based on management’s evaluation of when control of the products has been passed to customers. The transfer of control to the customer occurs when products have been picked up by, or shipped to, the customer based on the terms of the contract. Each product is considered distinct from all other promised products in the contract because the Company does not provide a service of significant integration between each product promised, each product promised does not modify or customize any other product promised under the contract, and the promised products are not highly interrelated or interdependent. Some contracts may also include upfront deposits or require the customer to pay the full sale price up front. Any advance payments are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue upon transfer of control of the products to the customer.
Cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)
The Company’s cost of revenue consists primarily of direct costs of generating revenue, including electric power costs, hosting costs, repairs and maintenance, occupancy, materials and supply costs, and labor.
Stock-based compensation
The Company recognizes compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards made to employees, directors, consultants, and service providers, if any, including incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock awards, and stock units based upon the estimated grant-date fair value of the awards.
104

Table of Contents
The fair value of stock-based payment awards is amortized over the requisite service period, which is defined as the period during which a recipient is required to provide service in exchange for an award. The Company generally uses a graded attribution method for all grants. Awards with both performance and service conditions are expensed over the service period for each separately vesting tranche. Forfeitures are recorded as incurred. 
For more complex performance awards, including awards with market-based performance conditions, the Company employs a Monte Carlo simulation valuation method to calculate the fair value of the awards based on the most likely outcome. Under the Monte Carlo simulation, a number of variables and assumptions are used including, but not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the award, the risk-free rate, and dividend yield, if any. In accordance with accounting guidance for awards with market conditions, stock-based compensation is recognized over the derived service period, regardless of whether the award achieves the market condition and will only be adjusted to the extent the service condition is not met. Performance-based stock-based compensation begins to be recognized when the achievement of each performance condition is deemed probable, as the outcome of each event has inherent risks and uncertainties, and a positive outcome may not be known until the event is achieved. Stock-based compensation cost is adjusted in future periods for subsequent changes in the expected outcome of the performance-related conditions.
Restricted stock units issued under the Company’s 2023 Omnibus Incentive Plan granted up to December 31, 2024 generally vest equally over a 
three-year
 period from grant date or for non-employee directors, fully vest by a certain date. Deferred stock units issued under the Company’s 2023 Omnibus Incentive Plan have been issued in vested state. Stock options issued under the Company’s 2023 Omnibus Incentive Plan were issued in vested state. Performance stock units issued under the Company’s 2023 Omnibus Incentive Plan generally have both market-based and service-based vest conditions as per each respective performance stock unit agreement.
Restricted stock units assumed in the Business Combination generally vest equally over a 
three-year
 period from the grant date. Deferred stock units assumed in the Business Combination were fully vested upon the assumption date. Both restricted stock units and deferred stock units assumed from the Business Combination are governed under the Hut 8 Mining Corp. Omnibus Long Term Incentive Plan; further details are in Note 19. 
Stock-based compensation
.
Stock options issued under the Hut 8 Corp. Rollover Option Plan were typically granted with an exercise price equal to no less than the market price of the Company’s stock at the date of grant and expire up to 
ten
 years from the date of grant. These options generally vest over a 
two-year
, 
four-year
, or 
six-year
 period. Certain option awards may vest subject to achievement of specific performance conditions.

Income taxes
The Company complies with the accounting and reporting requirements of ASC Topic 740, 
Income Taxes
 (“ASC 740”), which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in future taxable or deductible amounts, based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.
A valuation allowance is recorded if it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In evaluating whether a valuation allowance is needed, we consider all relevant evidence, including past performance, recent cumulative losses, projections of future taxable income, and the viability of tax planning strategies. If we subsequently determine that there is sufficient evidence to indicate a deferred tax asset will be realized, the associated valuation allowance is reversed.
We recognize positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return in the Consolidated Financial Statements when it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. A recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit with greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. There were no interest or penalties related to income taxes that have been accrued or recognized as of December 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, June 30, 2023, and June 30, 2022. 
Net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders
The Company previously calculated basic and diluted net income per share attributable to common stockholders in conformity with the two-class method required for companies with participating securities. The Company’s previously outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock were considered participating securities as the holders were entitled to receive aggregated accrued and not paid dividends if/when declared by the board of directors at a dividend rate payable in preference and priority to the holders of common stock; however, as described in Note 18. 
Stockholders’ equity
, a recapitalization of equity structure occurred in connection with the Business Combination where all series of previously outstanding USBTC preferred stock prior to the Business Combination were retrospectively recast at an exchange ratio of all series of USBTC preferred stock exchanged for 
0.6716
 shares of the Company’s common stock, rounded down, if applicable, on a holder level based on their aggregate holdings of all USBTC shares. As such, the previously outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock are no longer considered after the retrospective recast of equity.
Under the two-class method, basic net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders was calculated by dividing the net income (loss) less any net income allocated to participating securities by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders was computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive shares of common stock outstanding for the period. For purposes of this calculation, stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, deferred stock units, performance stock units, and common stock purchase warrants were considered potentially dilutive shares of common stock computed using the treasury-stock method. Potential shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Company’s convertible note are computed using the if-converted method. Under the if-converted method, net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders is adjusted by the effect, net of tax, of potentially dilutive shares computed under this method. In computing potentially dilutive shares of common stock, each class of shares is applied to basic net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders on a most to least dilutive basis until a particular class no longer produces further dilution, if applicable.

Table of Contents
As of periods beginning on or after July 1, 2023, the Company no longer had participating securities other than common stock. As such, the Company no longer was required to calculate earnings per share under the two-class method. Basic net income (loss) per share of common stock from continuing operations attributable to the Company and basic net income (loss) per share of common stock from discontinued operations attributable to the Company are computed by dividing net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to the Company and net income (loss) from discontinued operations attributable to the Company, respectively, by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share of common stock from continuing operations attributable to the Company is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive shares of common stock, including stock options, restricted stock units, deferred stock units, performance stock units, and common stock purchase warrants to the extent dilutive under the treasury-stock method, and potential shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Company’s convertible note under the if-converted method. Under the if-converted method, net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to the Company is adjusted by the effect, net of tax, of potentially dilutive shares computed under this method. In computing potentially dilutive shares of common stock, each class of shares is applied to basic net income (loss) per share of common stock from continuing operations attributable to the Company on a most to least dilutive basis until a particular class no longer produces further dilution, if applicable. Diluted net income (loss) per share of common stock from discontinued operations attributable to the Company is computed by using the same denominator used to calculate diluted net income (loss) per share of common stock from continuing operations attributable to the Company, as previously noted.
Foreign currency
The U.S. Dollar is the functional and presentation currency of the Company. The Company has consolidated subsidiaries that have a non-U.S. Dollar functional currency. Each of the Company’s subsidiaries determines its own functional currency and items of each subsidiary included in the Consolidated Financial Statements are measured using that functional currency. Assets and liabilities of foreign operations having a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar are translated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting date and revenues and expenses at average rates during the period. Foreign currency translation adjustments are reflected within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in profit or loss for the period.  Foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities of the Company are translated using the rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting date, and non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at fair value are translated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Revenues and expenses are measured at average rates during the period. Gains or losses on translation of these items are included in earnings. Foreign currency denominated non-monetary assets and liabilities, measured at historic cost, are translated at the rate of exchange at the transaction date.
Business combinations
Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The acquisition cost is measured at the fair value of the consideration transferred at the acquisition date.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is initially measured at cost, being the difference between the fair value of the consideration transferred, including the recognized amount of any non-controlling interest (“NCI”) in the acquiree and the net recognized amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. If the net of the amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess is recognized immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.
Acquisition-related costs, other than those that are associated with the issue of debt or equity securities that the Company incurs in connection with a business combination, are expensed as incurred.
Share capital
Shares of common stock are classified as an equity instrument. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of common stock are recognized as a reduction of equity, net of the related tax effect.

NCI
NCI represents the portion of net assets in consolidated entities that are not owned by the Company and are reported as a component of equity on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2024, NCI on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet consists of the 
19.9
% ownership by a non-affiliated party in Far North. For more details, refer to Note 3. 
Far North Acquisition
. 
​
​
Note 3. Far North acquisition
On February 15, 2024, a subsidiary of the Company completed a stalking horse bid to acquire 
four
 natural gas power plants in Ontario, Canada in partnership with Macquarie Equipment Finance Ltd. (“Macquarie”), a subsidiary of Macquarie Group Limited, a global financial services group. The Company completed the transaction to increase its energy-related assets.
The Company recorded the transaction as a business combination and the assets and liabilities of the power plants were recorded at their estimated fair values.
The Far North JV, of which the Company has 
80.1
% indirect ownership and the remaining 
19.9
% of which is owned by Macquarie, purchased assets, liabilities, and the business operations of 
four
 natural gas power plants located in Iroquois Falls, Ontario; North Bay, Ontario; Kapuskasing, Ontario; and Kingston, Ontario.

Total transaction expenses recognized for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $
1.7
 million and included in 
General and administrative expenses
 in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). The Company paid $
7.5
 million in August 2023 to Macquarie, which was recorded in 
Deposits and prepaid expenses
 on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The deposit was included in the purchase price consideration and was $
7.4
 million in February 2024 due to foreign currency translation. The Company received a credit of $
7.9
 million in the Far North JV for investing mining infrastructure and equipment at the North Bay, Ontario facility. The net result of the investment of mining infrastructure and equipment in the Far North JV was that Macquarie obtained a 19.9% indirect ownership interest in the invested assets due to their NCI ownership in the Far North JV. The Company determined the value of the NCI to be $
4.5
 million using the liquidation value of the net identifiable assets and liabilities acquired. The Company recorded a gain on bargain purchase included in other (expense) income of $
3.1
 million in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) given the Company completed the transaction through a stalking horse bid.

As part of the transaction, the Company restructured a loan of $
24.6
 million with Macquarie as a sale lease back agreement of the power plant assets located in Iroquois Falls, Ontario. The sale lease back agreement constituted a debt modification rather than a debt extinguishment and has been reflected accordingly on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as an equipment finance lease.

1.3
 million, respectively.

Note 4. Discontinued Operations
On March 4, 2024, the Company announced the closure of its Drumheller, Alberta mining site after analysis of the Company’s operations. It was determined that the profitability of the Company’s Drumheller site had been impacted significantly by various factors, including elevated energy costs and underlying voltage issues. The Company maintains its lease at the site and will consider re-energizing the site if market conditions improve.

In November 2024, the Company entered into the BITMAIN Purchase Agreement, with BITMAIN to purchase approximately 
30,000
 BITMAIN Antminer S21+ ASIC miners. In December 2024, the Company completed its Bitcoin pledge by depositing 
968
 Bitcoin into a segregated wallet with BITMAIN, which remains subject to a three-month redemption right, whereby the Company has the option to repurchase, with cash, the pledged Bitcoin at a mutually agreed upon fixed price. If the Company does not exercise this right within the redemption period, BITMAIN will retain full ownership of the pledged Bitcoin as consideration for the purchased ASIC miners.
​
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had pledged 
968
 Bitcoin with a fair value of $
92.4
 million, classified as 
Digital assets – pledged for miner purchase 
under current assets on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. A corresponding Miner purchase liability of $
15.1
 million was recorded under 
Accounts payable and accrued expenses
 under current liabilities on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets, reflecting its obligation to either redeem the pledged Bitcoin for cash or put it towards the purchase of ASIC miners by not redeeming the pledged Bitcoin at the end of the redemption period.
In accordance with ASC Topic 610-20 
Other Income – Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets
, the Company assessed the transfer of nonfinancial assets, Bitcoin, under ASC 606. Specifically, the Company noted that the Bitcoin pledged to BITMAIN under the BITMAIN Purchase Agreement constitutes a repurchase agreement under ASC 606. As a result, the Bitcoin was not derecognized upon transfer as the Company retains a repurchase option.
Due to the redemption right and the Company’s continued economic exposure to the Bitcoin, the pledged Bitcoin is separately classified as 
Digital assets – pledged for miner purchase
 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, which represents restricted Bitcoin.
The Company recorded a Bitcoin redemption right derivative asset with an initial fair value of $
15.1
 million. See Note 16.

Salt Creek substation purchase
On December 29, 2023, a subsidiary of the Company purchased a substation in Culberson County, Texas, as well as the 
1.9
 acres of land on which the substation sits, for a total of $
7.1
 million in cash consideration, which was paid in full during the quarter ended March 31, 2024. The Company also entered into a lease for 20 additional acres of land adjacent to this substation. In April 2024, the Company’s subsidiary completed construction on a new Bitcoin mining site on this leased land and the Company began Bitcoin mining at the Salt Creek site upon completion of the construction. 
Impairment of long-lived assets
On March 6, 2024, the Company announced the closure of its Drumheller site in Alberta, Canada. The Company further assessed the profitability of the site which indicated that an impairment triggering event had occurred. Accordingly, with the closure of the Drumheller site, the long-lived assets of the site were fully written down. This resulted in a write down of $
6.1
 million, which is reflected in the 
(Loss) income from discontinued operations
 in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024. 
There was 
no
 impairment on the Company’s long-lived assets for the six months ended December 31, 2023. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, the Company had an impairment on its long-lived assets of approximately $
63.6
 million. The Company did 
no
t have an impairment on its long-lived assets for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022.
There is considerable management judgment necessary to determine the estimated future cash flows and fair values of the Company’s long-lived assets, and, accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from such estimates, which fall under Level 3 within the fair value measurement hierarchy (see discussion of fair value measurements in Note 2.

Note 10. Investment in unconsolidated joint venture
On November 25, 2022, a subsidiary of the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) with Compute North Member, LLC to purchase its 
50
% membership interest in TZRC, an early stage operator of vertically integrated digital asset mining and power facilities (the “Acquired Interests”). The transaction closed on December 6, 2022. As of June 30, 2023, the Company determined that the fair value of the net assets acquired differed from the carrying value of the estimated fair value of the underlying net assets acquired by approximately $
22.4
 million. This difference is attributable to depreciable and amortizable assets and liabilities and, in accordance with ASC 323, should be accreted within 
Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint venture
 in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). For the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, six months ended December 31, 2023, and twelve months ended June 30, 2023, the amount of accretion was $
7.0
 million, $
3.5
 million, and $
4.1
 million, respectively.
The consideration paid by the Company’s subsidiary for the acquisition of the Acquired Interests consisted $
10.0
 million of cash and the assumption of a senior secured promissory note (the “TZRC Secured Promissory Note”) with a fair value estimate as of the transaction date of approximately $
95.1
 million. See Note 15. 
Loans and notes payable
 for a discussion of the assumed promissory note from the TZRC transaction. 
TZRC is a two-member operating joint venture where both members jointly control the essential areas of the entity’s business. The purpose of TZRC is to develop, construct, install, own, finance, rent, and operate one or more modular data centers located on or near renewable power sources for purposes of digital asset mining. The entity self-mines and provides hosting services, both of which activities began in August 2022. Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company assumed the role of property manager under a PMA to provide day-to-day management and oversight services of TZRC’s data center facilities. The service contract has a term of 
10 years
 and is automatically renewed for successive 
one-year
 terms unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal. As property manager, the Company is entitled to approximately $
1.5
 million per year, subject to downward adjustment based on capacity utilization of TZRC’s data centers. 
In addition, the PMA allows pass through costs on behalf of the Company, such as payroll and other incidental costs. Pass through costs for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, six months ended December 31, 2023, and twelve months ended June 30, 2023 were approximately 
$
2.3
 million, 
$
1.0
 million, and 
$
1.4
 million, respectively.
The Company accounts for its indirect 
50
% interest in TZRC using the equity method of accounting. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, six months ended December 31, 2023, and twelve months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recorded its ownership percentage of income of TZRC within 
Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint venture
 in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for $
3.8
 million, $
2.7
 million, and $
2.1
 million of net income. The carrying value of the Company’s investment in TZRC was $
82.5
 million and $
82.7
 million, as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and is included in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Company elected to bypass the annual qualitative impairment test for its goodwill and proceeded to perform a quantitative impairment test for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 in accordance with ASC Topic 350, 
Intangibles—Goodwill and Other
. The Company’s goodwill is fully attributable to its Bitcoin mining reporting unit, which is an operating segment of the Compute reportable segment. The quantitative impairment test considered both the income and market approach to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. The market approach included comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in the Company’s industry and the income approach included future estimated cash flows that were discounted to their present value to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. The estimated fair value exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting unit and no goodwill impairment was necessary.
​
The annual qualitative impairment test for the six months ended December 31, 2023 resulted in 
no
 impairment of goodwill.

TZRC Secured Promissory Note
As previously discussed, a subsidiary of the Company assumed a secured promissory note with an estimated fair value amount as of the date of investment of approximately $
95.1
 million as part of the consideration paid to acquire an equity membership interest in TZRC. The estimated fair value represents a discount of approximately $
1.7
 million from the carryover basis of the promissory note. The discount is being amortized over the term of the promissory note into interest expense.
The stated interest on the TZRC Secured Promissory Note accrues at a rate per annum equal to the lesser of (a) a varying rate per annum equal to the sum of (i) the 
prime rate
 as published in The Wall Street Journal, plus (ii) 
12.0
% per annum, (b) 
15.25
% per annum and (c) the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by law. The Company’s subsidiary has the option to defer the interest until maturity of the note under a paid-in-kind (“PIK”) payment option. The Company’s subsidiary elected to apply the PIK payment option. Accordingly, the interest increases the principal amount of the secured promissory note. PIK interest is payable upon maturity of the note in April 2027, unless or until any portion or all of the promissory note is prepaid under the prepayment option discussed below. The Company’s subsidiary is also subject to post-default interest of an additional 
2
% upon occurrence of an event of default. The higher interest rate applies from the date of non-payment until such amount is paid in full. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the interest rate on the secured promissory note was 
15.25
%.
The Company’s subsidiary has the option to prepay the secured promissory note in whole or in part without premium or penalty. There are no required minimum monthly payments. When distributions are made from TZRC to the Company’s subsidiary, the Company uses 
100
% of those funds to immediately pay down the TZRC Secured Promissory Note. Any prepayment would be accompanied by all accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount prepaid. The TZRC Secured Promissory Note is secured by a first priority security interest in the Company’s membership interest in TZRC. The Company is not a guarantor of the TZRC Secured Promissory Note, and there is no recourse to the Company.
As of December 31, 2024, approximately $
84.2
 million in principal and PIK interest, exclusive of a $
0.9
 million discount, was outstanding under the TZRC Secured Promissory Note, with payment of principal and PIK interest due upon the first to occur of (a) the date that is 
five years
 from origination on April 8, 2022, (b) the date of any event of dissolution of TZRC, and (c) the date of the closing of certain events specified in TZRC’s governing documents.
Third Party Note
On December 6, 2022, the Company, entered into a $
10.0
 million note with a third party (“TPN”). 
The TPN had a maturity date of December 5, 2027 and provided for an interest rate of 
6.0
%
 per annum. 
Interest on the TPN was PIK interest and was added to and capitalized on, the outstanding principal. The TPN was secured by certain assets of the Company and did not have financial covenants. On May 16, 2023, the Company amended its TPN. Under the amended TPN, the interest rate was increased to 
18.0
% per annum and full repayment of the TPN was required within 
45 days
 following the consummation of the Business Combination. In January 2024, the outstanding balance of the TPN, including all PIK interest, was paid in full in cash.

Anchorage Loan
In February 2023, the Company’s subsidiary restructured its outstanding Equipment Loan and Security Agreements (the “Anchorage Loan”) with Anchorage. The restructuring was accounted for under 
ASC 470-50 Modifications and Extinguishments
. The stated interest rate was 
9.0
% and was subject to adjustment after each year the loan was outstanding, if the Company’s subsidiary did not elect to prepay the Anchorage Loan. Interest rate changes were fixed not variable. The Anchorage Loan allowed the Company’s subsidiary to pay the interest as PIK interest by capitalizing unpaid and accrued interest into the principal amount subject to certain conditions. Interest was earned on the first of each annual anniversary date, and accrued on the principal balance and PIK interest from prior periods. In connection with the restructuring, the Company’s subsidiary paid approximately $
0.7
 million in closing fees, issued 
1,987,936
 shares of common stock of USBTC with an approximate value of $
0.8
 million (which shares were converted into shares of the Company’s common stock upon the closing of the Business Combination), and paid a termination fee of approximately $
0.4
 million. Monthly payments commenced on March 15, 2023 and represented 
100
% of net monthly cash flow from the immediately preceding calendar month activity related to certain Company miners as described below. The net monthly cash flow payment was allocated as follows: first, to pay all unpaid fees, costs, and expenses; second, to the payment of accrued and unpaid interest on the Anchorage Loan; and third, to the principal amount of the Anchorage Loan. If net monthly cash flows for a given month were zero or negative, then no monthly payment was due for such month.
The Anchorage Loan was secured by approximately 
21,000
 miners at the Company’s Alpha and Salt Creek facilities and all property, equipment, machinery, and other assets located at the Company’s Alpha facility. On April 25, 2023, the Anchorage Loan was amended so that interest accrued on the principal balance only and did not include prior period PIK interest.
On September 27, 2024, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a Debt Repayment Agreement with Anchorage to exchange the $
37.9
 million outstanding balance of the Anchorage Loan (exclusive of $
1.5
 million of deferred financing costs) as of the agreement date for 
2,313,435
 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Conversion”) at an exchange rate of $
16.395
 per share (the “Exchange Price”). Upon completion of the Conversion, the outstanding loan and all other related obligations of the Company and its subsidiaries under the Anchorage Loan were satisfied. Additionally, as a result of the Conversion, the Company derecognized the net carrying amount of the Anchorage Loan as of the Conversion date of $
36.4
 million (inclusive of a $
37.9
 million outstanding balance and $
1.5
 million of deferred financing costs), recorded a gain on debt extinguishment of $
6.0
 million (inclusive of $
0.2
 million in debt extinguishment costs), and to stockholders’ equity the fair value of the shares of common stock issued, net of share issuance costs, recorded as follows: $
30.2
 million to additional paid-in capital, net of share issuance costs of $
0.1
 million, and $
0.02
 million to common stock. Under the Debt Repayment Agreement, the Company agreed to file a registration statement with respect to the resale of the common stock issued under the Debt Repayment Agreement and provided Anchorage other customary rights with respect to such registration.
In the event that, on or prior to December 31, 2024, the Company (i) sold any shares of common stock, other than pursuant to certain excluded issuances, at a price per share that is less than the Exchange Price or (ii) issued any debt or equity instrument of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates that is convertible into or exchangeable for shares of common stock, other than pursuant to certain excluded issuances, at an initial conversion or exchange price, as applicable, that was less than the Exchange Price (“Better Offer”), then in each case, the Debt Repurchase Agreement would have been deemed to be amended to reflect a new Exchange Price that was the lowest Better Offer and the Company shall forthwith issue to Anchorage additional shares of common stock to reflect an Exchange Price that is equal to the lowest Better Offer. There were no issuances meeting these provisions on or prior to December 31, 2024, and therefore 
no
 additional shares of common stock were issued to Anchorage.

Coinbase credit facility
A subsidiary of the Company acquired in the Business Combination is party to a credit facility with Coinbase Credit, Inc. (“Coinbase”). The original credit facility was established on June 26, 2023 (the “Original Credit Facility”) and was amended and restated on each of January 12, 2024 and June 17, 2024. The Original Credit Facility provided for an interest of 
5.0
% plus the greater of (i) the US Federal Funds Target Rate – 
Upper Bound
 and (ii) 
3.25
%. The Original Credit Facility provided for up to $
50.0
 million in loans pursuant to drawdowns made available in three tranches: $
15.0
 million available from loan inception to 15 business days thereafter, $
20.0
 million available starting 30 calendar days after loan inception to 15 business days thereafter, and $
15.0
 million available the day after the closing of the Business Combination and 15 business days thereafter. On or prior to a drawdown, the Company’s subsidiary was required to pledge, as collateral, Bitcoin with a custodian, Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC, to be held in a segregated custody account under the Company subsidiary’s ownership, such that the loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratio of principal outstanding amount of the loan and the fair value of collateral is equal to or less than 
60
%. If the value of the collateral under the credit facility decreased past a specified margin, the Company’s subsidiary may have been required to post additional Bitcoin as collateral. 
On January 12, 2024, the Coinbase credit facility was amended and restated (the “First Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”) to, among other things, allow for a drawdown of a fourth tranche of $
15.0
 million, which the Company drew on January 12, 2024. Under the terms of the First Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, borrowed amounts bore interest at a rate equal to (a) the greater of (i) the US Federal Funds Target Rate – Upper Bound on the date of the applicable borrowing and (ii) 
3.25
%, 
plus
 (b) 
5.0
%. The First Amended and Restated Credit Agreement additionally established a right for Coinbase to deliver a partial prepayment notice to the Company’s subsidiary if the price of Bitcoin 
on Coinbase’s digital currency exchange platform (the “Prevailing Market Value”)
 was less than the higher of (x) $
25,000
 and (y) 
60
% of the Prevailing Market Value on the effective date of the First Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, requiring the Borrower to prepay $
15.0
 million in principal as well as any accrued and unpaid interest. The Company guaranteed certain of its subsidiary’s obligations under the First Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.
On June 17, 2024, the Company entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement (the “Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”) with Coinbase. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement extends the final maturity date to June 16, 2025, modifies the LTV thresholds for a margin call, margin release or breach of the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, and modifies the interest rate at a rate equal to (a) the greater of (x) the federal funds rate on the date of the applicable borrowing and (y) 
3.25
%, 
plus
 (b) 
6.0
%. 
Under the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement there is no guaranty by the Company of its subsidiary’s obligations. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also removes the right for Coinbase to deliver a partial repayment notice to Company if the Prevailing Market Value is less than the higher of (x) 
$
25,000
 and (y) 
60
%
 of the Prevailing Market Value on the effective date of the First Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. 
As of December 31, 2024, the Company has $
65.0
 million outstanding with Coinbase under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, exclusive of deferred financing costs of $
0.04
 million.
Coatue Note (convertible note)
On June 21, 2024, the Company entered into a Convertible Note Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Coatue Tactical Solutions Lending Holdings AIV 3 LP (the “Coatue Fund”), and a subsidiary of the Company (the “Guarantor”) providing for the purchase and sale of a convertible note (the “convertible note”) in the principal amount of 
$
150.0
 million (such amount, together with any PIK interest accrued from time to time, the “Accreted Principal Amount”). The convertible note is a senior unsecured obligation of the Company and guaranteed by the Guarantor pursuant to a Guaranty Agreement. On June 28, 2024, the Company issued the convertible note to the Coatue Fund.
The convertible note bears interest at a rate of 
8.00
%
 per year, payable quarterly in arrears on each March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, commencing September 30, 2024. Interest may be PIK or paid in cash, at the Company’s option. The convertible note will has an initial term of 
five years
 and may be extended, at the Company’s option, for up to 
three
 additional 
one-year
 terms. At maturity, the Company will pay the Coatue Fund the Accreted Principal Amount, together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon.
126

Table of Contents
During the term of the convertible note, the convertible note is convertible from time to time, in whole or in part, into shares of the Company’s common stock at the option of the Coatue Fund. The initial conversion price of the convertible note is 
$
16.395
 per share of common stock, subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments.
The Coatue Fund will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all, but not less than all, of the convertible note upon a change of control or a delisting on a U.S. stock exchange. If the implied valuation of such event is at least 
$
11.50
 per share of the Company’s common stock, the mandatory redemption price will be 
150
%
 of the original principal amount of the convertible note (“Contingent Repurchase Right”), and if the implied valuation of such event is less than 
$
11.50
 per share of the Company’s common stock, the redemption price will be equal to the Accreted Principal Amount, together with any accrued and unpaid interest as of the redemption date.
Beginning on the two-year anniversary of the convertible note’s issuance and continuing until its maturity, the Company has the right, from time to time, to redeem all or any portion of the convertible note for a redemption price equal to 
100
%
 of the Accreted Principal Amount, together with any accrued and unpaid interest as of the redemption date if (i) the closing price of the Company’s common stock equals or exceeds 
150
%
 of the then-applicable conversion price for a specified period of time and (ii) there is an effective registration statement covering the resale of any shares of the Company’s common stock issued upon conversion of the convertible note or, in the alternative, the shares of the Company’s common stock issuable pursuant to the convertible note to the extent the Coatue Fund converts at the time would be freely tradable by the Coatue Fund pursuant to Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (including without any restriction on volume), subject to a daily redemption limitation such that the number of shares of the Company’s common stock into which the Accreted Principal Amount to be redeemed would be converted does not exceed, after giving effect to such conversion, 
100
%
 of the average daily trading volume of the Company’s common stock calculated over a specified period of time.  
The Purchase Agreement includes certain representations, warranties, and covenants, including limitations on the ability of the Company and the Guarantor to incur indebtedness, make certain restricted payments and investments, and enter into affiliate transactions, subject to certain exceptions enumerated in the Purchase Agreement. The Company may consummate a transaction restricted by the foregoing covenants without the Coatue Fund’s consent, so long as it substantially concurrently and as a condition thereto repurchases the convertible note in full from the Coatue Fund for an amount in cash equal to the greater of (i) 
120
%
 of the original principal amount of the convertible note and (ii) the Accreted Principal Amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of such repurchase. The Purchase Agreement also sets forth certain standard events of default upon which the convertible note may be declared immediately due and payable.
As mentioned in Note 2. 
Basis of presentation, summary of significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements – Convertible Instrument and Derivatives
, the Company has identified embedded derivatives and separated an embedded derivative, the Contingent Repurchase Right, from the convertible note. The remaining debt host contract is discounted by the initial fair value of the separated embedded derivative from convertible note of nil and is offset by issuance costs. The debt host contract of the convertible note is subsequently measured at amortized cost, and the debt discount and issuance costs are amortized to interest expense over the expected term of the host contract using the effective interest method. The convertible note has an effective interest rate of 
8.23
%
 and its contractual interest expense was 
$
6.2
 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024. The amortization of debt discount and issuance costs for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 was 
$
0.06
 million. The convertible note had an outstanding principal amount of 
$
153.1
 million inclusive of PIK interest accrued, unamortized debt discount and issuance costs of 
$
0.8
 million, net carrying amount of 
$
152.3
 million, and fair value of 
$
237.9
 million. The fair value of the convertible note is estimated using the same method and inputs as the separated embedded derivative from convertible note as disclosed in Note 16. 
Derivatives
. The Company determined that the convertible note is a Level 3 liability given an unobservable input is included in its valuation. The separated embedded derivative from convertible note was initially recorded at nil. See Note 16.

Bitcoin redemption option
During December 2024, in connection with the BITMAIN Purchase Agreement, the Company pledged 
968
 Bitcoin to BITMAIN in connection with a purchase of approximately 
30,000
 BITMAIN Antminer S21+ ASIC miners. The Company has the option to redeem the pledged Bitcoin at a mutually agreed upon fixed price starting from and for up to three months after the shipment date of the purchased miners. The amount of Bitcoin that can be redeemed is pro-rata of the percentage of miners shipped. The Company accounted for this Bitcoin redemption option as a Level 3 derivative asset as noted in Note 2. 
Basis of presentation, summary of significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements – Derivatives
. A significant unobservable input included in the fair value estimate of the Bitcoin redemption option is the estimated shipment date of the purchased miners, which management estimated to begin at the end of January 2025 as of December 31, 2024.
As of December 31, 2024 and December 18, 2024, the Company estimated the fair value of the Bitcoin redemption option using the Black-Scholes pricing model with the following inputs and inputs noted in the paragraph above:

During April 2024, the Company sold covered call options on 
2,125
 Bitcoin notional for proceeds of $
20.8
 million and during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, recorded a realized gain of $

Basis of presentation, summary of significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements – Derivatives
, the Company sold covered call options on Bitcoin to generate cash flow on a portion of its Bitcoin. The Company pledged Bitcoin as collateral with 
one
 of its Bitcoin custodians, in a quantity equal to the notional amount, for these covered call options sold. The collateral was returned to the Company upon the expiration of the call options. The covered call options were only exercisable upon the date of expiry, were automatically exercised if the underlying reference price was greater than the strike price of the call option, and were net cash settled on the business day immediately following expiry. The reference price was the Bitcoin Reference Rate published by the CME Group and Crypto Facilities Ltd., or any successor (“BRR”), between 4:00pm and 4:30pm London time for a given date. The covered call options were carried at fair value and were Level 2 liabilities as noted in Note 2

During October 2024, the Company sold covered call options on 
2,000
 Bitcoin notional for proceeds of $
2.9
 million. During the November 2024, the Company rolled these call options into new call options with the same Bitcoin notional. The Company achieved this roll by exchanging its previous call options sold for new call options. As a result of the roll, the Company paid $
1.5
 million in cash and recorded a realized loss of $
23.3
 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024. The Company has pledged Bitcoin as collateral with 
one
 of its Bitcoin custodians in a quantity equal to the notional amount for these covered call options sold. The collateral continues to be pledged in the same manner after the roll. The covered call options exchanged in the roll were only exercisable upon the date of expiry, were automatically exercised if the underlying reference price was greater than the strike price of the call option, and were settled with delivery of the underlying Bitcoin. The reference price was the BRR at 4:00pm London time for a given date. The covered call options were carried at fair value and were Level 2 liabilities as noted in Note 2. B

Basis of presentation, summary of significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements – Convertible instruments
 and Note 15. 
Loans and notes payable
, the Company issued a convertible note with embedded derivatives and separated the Contingent Repurchase Right embedded derivative. The separated embedded derivative from convertible note was separated from its debt host contract and was accounted for as a derivative liability carried at fair value in accordance with ASC 815. As noted in Note 2. 
Basis of presentation, summary of significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements – Fair value
 measurement, the separated embedded derivative from convertible note is a Level 3 liability. A significant unobservable input included in the fair value estimate of the separated embedded derivative from convertible note is management’s estimate of the Contingent Repurchase Right’s probability of occurrence, which was remote as at inception and December 31, 2024. As such, the initial fair value of the separated embedded derivative from convertible note was 
nil
 and the fair value as of December 31, 2024 was 
nil
.
As of December 31, 2024 and June 28, 2024, the Company estimated the fair value of the separated embedded derivative from convertible note using the PDE Model with the following inputs and inputs noted in the paragraph above:

The Company’s operating leases do not provide an implicit rate, therefore the Company uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate represents an estimate of the interest rate the Company would incur at lease commencement to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis for similar assets over the term of the lease.

Note 18. Stockholders’ equity
Authorized shares
The Company’s certificate of incorporation, as amended, authorized 
1,000,000,000
 shares of common stock, par value of $
0.01
 per share, and 
25,000,000
 shares of preferred stock, par value of $
0.01
 per share.
The Business Combination constituted a business combination and was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. In addition, a recapitalization of equity structure occurred where the equity structure of the Company reflects the equity structure of the legal parent as a result of the Business Combination, in this case the combined company named “Hut 8 Corp.” These Consolidated Financial Statements contain recast stockholders’ equity balances resulting from the retroactive application of recapitalization accounting in accordance with GAAP, except where otherwise noted. Pursuant to the terms of the Business Combination Agreement on November 30, 2023, stockholders of USBTC received 
0.6716
 of a share of the Company’s common stock for each share of USBTC common stock. Legacy Hut shareholders received 
0.2000
 of a share of the Company’s common stock for each Legacy Hut common share. All previously outstanding USBTC common stock, all series of previously outstanding USBTC preferred stock, all previously outstanding USBTC stock options, and all previously outstanding USBTC restricted stock awards are presented in the recast Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity, if applicable, and in the accompanying notes on an as-converted basis, converted at the ratio of 
0.6716
 for each USBTC share. Fractional shares, if any, were rounded down to the nearest whole share at a stockholder level. Fractional options, if any, were rounded down to the nearest whole option at an award level.

In September 2022, USBTC’s board of directors authorized a stock split of its common stock, par value $
0.00001
 per share, and its preferred stock, par value $
0.00001
, at a ratio of 
250
-for-1 (the “2022 Stock Split”) and also increased the number of shares of authorized USBTC common stock to 
83,950,000
, increased the number of authorized shares of USBTC Series A preferred stock to 
5,275,753
, increased the number of authorized shares of USBTC Series B preferred stock to 
6,716,000
, and increased the number of authorized shares of USBTC Series B-1 preferred stock to 
2,518,500
. In addition, USBTC’s board of directors increased the numbers of shares authorized for issuance in the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan to 
11,677,577
. As a result of the 2022 Stock Split, (i) every 1 share of the issued and outstanding USBTC common stock and USBTC preferred stock were automatically converted into 
250
 newly issued and outstanding shares of USBTC common stock and USBTC preferred stock, respectively, without any change in the par value per share, and (ii) the number of authorized shares of USBTC common stock and USBTC preferred stock outstanding was proportionally increased. Shares of USBTC common stock underlying outstanding stock options and other equity instruments convertible into USBTC common stock were proportionately increased and the respective exercise prices, if applicable, were proportionately decreased in accordance with the terms of the agreements governing such securities. Fractional shares, if any, resulting from the 2022 Stock Split were rounded up to the nearest whole share, and all shares of USBTC common stock and USBTC preferred stock (including fractions thereof) issuable upon the 2022 Stock Split to a given stockholder were aggregated for the purpose of determining whether the 2022 Stock Split would result in the issuance of a fractional share. Conversion terms on USBTC’s preferred stock were not changed. USBTC preferred stock converted on a one to one basis for USBTC common stock after the 2022 Stock Split.

At-the-Market Offering (“2024 ATM”) and Stock Repurchase Programs
On December 4, 2024, the Company entered into a Controlled Equity Offering Sales Agreement to establish an at-the-market equity program, allowing the Company to offer and sell up to $

Preferred stock
The reverse recapitalization of equity structure on all series of previously outstanding USBTC preferred stock prior to the Business Combination is as mentioned above in this note.
USBTC’s articles of incorporation, as amended, authorized 
5,275,753
 shares of USBTC Series A preferred stock, 
6,716,000
 shares of USBTC Series B preferred stock, and 
2,518,500
 shares of USBTC Series B-1 preferred stock. Each holder of USBTC Series A, Series B, and Series B-1 preferred stock was able to convert any or all of their USBTC preferred shares into 
one
 share of USBTC’s common stock. Additionally, all outstanding shares of USBTC Series A, Series B and Series B-1 preferred stock automatically converted into shares of USBTC common stock upon either (a) the closing of a transaction which results in USBTC being a publicly traded vehicle (whether directly or as a subsidiary) based on a valuation for USBTC on its own of $
200.0
 million or more, or (b) the date, or upon the occurrence of an event, specified by vote or written consent of the requisite holders, as defined in USBTC’s articles of incorporation. USBTC reserved a sufficient number of shares to provide for conversion of all USBTC preferred stock outstanding. Each holder of USBTC preferred stock was entitled to vote on all matters submitted to the shareholders of USBTC. Upon liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the business of USBTC, each holder of USBTC preferred stock was entitled to receive for each share, a pro rata distribution with USBTC’s common stock, with the most senior USBTC preferred stock paid out at 
100
% first. In September 2022, USBTC’s board of directors also authorized 
11,119,681
 shares of USBTC Series C preferred stock for issuance under the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan. 
No
 shares of USBTC Series C preferred stock were issued and outstanding.
Beginning in September 2021 and continuing through October 22, 2021, USBTC sold 
6,715,973
 shares of USBTC Series B preferred stock, $
0.00001
 par value, for gross proceeds of $
61.2
 million. Beginning on December 24, 2021 and continuing through April 2022, USBTC sold 
532,744
 shares of USBTC Series B-1 preferred stock, $
0.00001
 par value, for gross proceeds of approximately $
12.5
 million. Total offering costs associated with the USBTC preferred stock offerings was approximately $
0.2
 million.
Shares subject to registration and recission of Series A preferred stock
During June 2021, USBTC’s management became aware that court orders against family members of two of USBTC’s now former stockholders (the “Actors”), may have precluded USBTC from relying on certain federal and state securities exemptions for the offerings since the Actors may have been deemed “promoters” based on certain of their activities in one or more of USBTC’s securities offerings. Upon analysis of each state in which shares were sold, USBTC believed that the securities sold would have qualified for the exemption from registration in all but one state had the appropriate notice and/or emption filings been made in the applicable states. In Virginia, no exemption was available and registration would have been required. On October 26, 2021, USBTC entered into a settlement order with Virginia, conditioned on rescission offers being delivered to four investors resident in that state. USBTC completed all requirements set forth in the order. Therefore, on October 26, 2021, the USBTC shares were transferred and reclassified to permanent equity (
440,736
 shares of USBTC common stock and 
74,043
 shares of USBTC Series A preferred stock).

Table of Contents
As a result of the identification of the above issues, on June 23, 2021, USBTC’s board of directors approved a voluntary rescission offer to be sent to each investor in each of USBTC's 
two
 common stock offerings (referred to as the “Founder’s Round” and “Seed Round”), USBTC Series A preferred stock offering, and the promissory note offering to ensure that stockholders and noteholders, as applicable, were made aware of the issues identified and had the opportunity to request redemption of their securities. Between June 28, 2021, and the middle of July 2021, USBTC notified all stockholders and promissory noteholders of the rescission offer.
USBTC accounted for these transactions in accordance with FASB ASC 480. In accordance with ASC 480-10-S99-3A, USBTC considered the rights of the holders as it relates to the individual instrument itself, meaning the common and preferred shares do not contain a put right for the holder. As such, based upon the analysis of the terms of the underlying/individual instrument, it was concluded the shares were not redeemable and not within the scope.
USBTC then viewed the rescission offer as a call/put option and analyzed the shares to determine if there was any value to this option. USBTC’s analyses concluded that the classes of instruments had current fair values that exceeded the rescission offer amount, and as such, the option had de minimis value.
Additionally, USBTC notified state regulators in certain of the states in which stockholders and noteholders resided.
One
 stockholder accepted the rescission offer and USBTC repurchased 
21,155
 shares of USBTC Series A preferred stock for $
0.1
 million in July 2021 pursuant thereto. All other stockholders rejected the offer to repurchase their shares and the period for a stockholder to exercise the repurchase right has since expired. In addition, all of the noteholders rejected USBTC’s offer to repurchase the outstanding promissory notes.
In connection with the rescission offer, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth, Securities Division (the “Massachusetts Division”) issued a Consent Order, Docket No. E-2022-0011, on March 22, 2022 (the “Massachusetts Order”) in lieu of a hearing. The Massachusetts Order recited that the Massachusetts Division had conducted an investigation of USBTC pursuant to the Massachusetts Uniform Act, Mass. Gen. Laws c. 110A the (“Massachusetts Securities Act”) and the regulations promulgated thereunder (the “Massachusetts Regulations”), and reviewed self-reported allegations of alleged sales of unregistered securities of USBTC in the State of Massachusetts in potential violation of the Massachusetts Securities Act and Massachusetts Regulations which securities had not been determined to be exempt from registration requirements. As had been agreed and consented to by USBTC, the Massachusetts Order, among other things, required USBTC to pay an administrative fine in the amount of $
1.0
 million. In April 2022, USBTC paid the $
1.0
 million administrative fine.
Common stock warrants
In connection with the Business Combination, warrants to purchase Legacy Hut common shares outstanding immediately before the Business Combination were assumed by the Company. Post-Business Combination, the warrants are entitled to receive, upon exercise, in lieu of Legacy Hut common shares, shares of common stock of the Company at an exchange ratio of 
0.2000
, rounded down to the nearest whole share at a warrant agreement level if applicable, and at an exercise price of the original exercise price divided by the exchange ratio of 
0.2000
, rounded up to the nearest whole cent if applicable. The warrants include a net share settlement clause at the discretion of the warrant holder, which may result in a variable number of shares being issued for a fixed price due to the use of a certain volume-weighted average price of shares. The Company accounts for its warrants as equity instruments based on the specific terms of the relevant warrant agreements and has recorded them in additional paid-in capital in equity based on their fair value on the date of assumption. The warrants are valued at inception, upon events such as an exercise, and at subsequent reporting periods if applicable. The classification of the warrants, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities, is reassessed at the end of each reporting period. The fair value of each warrant is estimated on the date of issuance or assumption using the Black-Scholes pricing model.

Note 19. Stock-based compensation
On March 16, 2021, USBTC established the USBTC 2021 Equity Incentive Plan. This plan allowed USBTC to award stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted awards, and performance awards to employees, consultants, and directors of USBTC and its affiliates and cancelled and forfeited awards were returned to the plan for future awards. In connection with the Business Combination, the Company adopted the Hut 8 Corp. Rollover Option Plan (the “2021 Plan”), which is identical to the USBTC 2021 Equity Incentive Plan, except for conforming changes to account for the Business Combination. 
4,490,400
 shares of the Company’s common stock have been authorized and registered to be issued under the 2021 Plan, and 
no
 further awards are available for grant under the 2021 Plan.
On November 30, 2023, in connection with the Business Combination, USBTC stock options outstanding immediately before the Business Combination were exchanged for 
0.6716
 stock options of the Company under the 2021 Plan (the “USBTC Replacement Options”). Upon the Business Combination, fractional stock options, if any, were rounded down to the nearest whole stock option at an award level. The exercise price of any USBTC Replacement Option was equal to the exercise price of the replaced USBTC stock option immediately before the Business Combination divided by 
0.6716
, rounded up to the nearest whole cent, if applicable.

Table of Contents
In connection with the Business Combination, the Company also adopted the Hut 8 Corp. 2023 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2023 Plan”) and Hut 8 Mining Corp. Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2018 Plan”). Under the 2023 Plan, stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance stock units, deferred stock units, other stock-based awards, and stock bonuses of the Company can be granted to employees, consultants, and directors of the Company and its affiliates. Cancelled and forfeited awards are returned to the 2023 Plan for future awards. 
6,065,682
 shares of the Company’s common stock have been authorized and registered to be issued under the 2023 Plan. The 2018 Plan was originally established by Legacy Hut on February 15, 2028 to allow Legacy Hut to award stock options and restricted share units to employees, consultants, service providers, and directors of Legacy Hut and its affiliates, as well as deferred share units to employees and directors of Legacy Hut. 
1,553,254
 shares of common stock have been authorized and registered to be issued under the 2018 Plan.
In connection with the Business Combination, equity awards outstanding under the 2018 Plan were amended such that (1) restricted share units and deferred share units were amended to settle in shares of the Company’s common stock under the 2018 Plan and (2) stock options were cancelled and reissued under the 2023 Plan, all at an exchange ratio of 
0.2000
 effective November 30, 2023. The exercise price of stock options immediately before the Business Combination was divided by the exchange ratio of 
0.2000
, rounded up to the nearest whole cent, if applicable, to obtain the exercise price of the reissued stock options. Fractional awards, if any, were rounded down to the nearest whole award unit at a holder level. 
As at December 31, 2024, only restricted stock units, deferred stock units, performance stock units, and stock options as replacements of Legacy Hut stock options have been granted under the 2023 Plan.
The Company’s stock-based compensation expense recognized during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, six months ended December 31, 2023, and twelve months ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022 is included in general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (loss) as follows:

In November 2023, prior to the Business Combination, USBTC issued 
968,388
 fully vested stock awards to replace previously cancelled awards. Upon such issuance, the Company immediately recognized $
7.8
 million of stock-based compensation expense.
Time-based restricted stock awards
On October 10, 2021, USBTC awarded 
395,908
 time-based restricted stock awards, with an estimated fair value of $
3.38
 per share. USBTC estimated the fair value as of September 30, 2021, utilizing the market approach and other fair value measurement techniques, such as the backsolve method, which derives the equity value for USBTC from a transaction involving USBTC’s own securities, in this case, USBTC’s Series B preferred stock offering on September 30, 2021. 
263,939
 of these awards were cancelled in February 2023 as noted below.
On January 5, 2023 and August 9, 2022, USBTC awarded 
704,449
 and 
4,869
 time-based restricted stock awards, respectively, with an estimated fair value of $
0.39
 and $
0.01
 per share, respectively. USBTC estimated the fair value of $
0.39
 as of December 31, 2022 and $
0.01
 as of June 30, 2022, respectively, utilizing a market approach and the Guideline Public Company Method to derive an estimated equity value from publicly traded companies deemed comparable to USBTC. Once the equity value was determined, USBTC used the option pricing method to allocate fair value to USBTC’s individual securities outstanding at the time.

In February 2023, USBTC cancelled 
704,449
 restricted stock awards that it had awarded on January 5, 2023 and 
263,939
 restricted stock awards from other previously issued restricted stock grants, and accordingly recognized compensation expense at that time of $
0.6
 million, which equaled the amount of the remaining unrecognized compensation expense for all of these awards. In addition, the time-based restricted stock awards held by USBTC’s then-CEO and Chief Operating Officer contained certain acceleration clauses if triggering events were to occur. On August 15, 2022, due to a loss of control over USBTC’s board of directors, the vesting was accelerated for these awards and the remaining amount of unrecognized compensation expense associated with these awards was recognized during the twelve months ended June 30, 2023.

Performance-based restricted stock awards
On October 10, 2021, USBTC awarded 
1,846,900
 performance-based restricted stock awards to its then-CEO and Chief Operating Officer that vested upon the achievement of two milestones as follows: (1) Milestone 1 – half of the shares vested when USBTC achieved 
10,000
 or more miners plugged in and secured purchase orders totaling 
3
 exahash of computing power before December 31, 2021 and (2) Milestone 2 – the other half of the shares vested when USBTC achieved 
20,000
 miners or more plugged in and secured purchase orders totaling 
6
 exahash of computing power before December 31, 2022. Milestone 1 was achieved prior to December 31, 2021 and Milestone 2 had not been achieved as of June 30, 2022. USBTC estimated a grant date fair value of $
3.38
 per share for these performance-based awards utilizing the assistance of a third-party valuation firm as discussed above under 
Time-based restricted stock awards.
On August 15, 2022, due to a loss of control over USBTC’s board of directors, the vesting for all of the unvested performance-based restricted stock awards held by USBTC’s then-CEO and Chief Operating Officer was accelerated and the remainder of the unrecognized compensation expense associated with these awards was recognized during the twelve months ended June 30, 2023.
138

Table of Contents
Additionally, as of June 30, 2022, USBTC also had a total of 
923,450
 unvested performance-based restricted stock awards that had been issued to its then-CEO and Chief Operating Officer on October 10, 2021 that were subject to vesting if USBTC achieved Milestone 2, as described above. The restricted stock awards also contained certain acceleration clauses if triggering events were to occur.
For the twelve months ended June 30, 2022, USBTC had a total of 
1,639,376
 unvested performance-based restricted stock awards that had been issued to USBTC’s then-CEO and Chief Operating Officer on March 17, 2021 that were subject to vesting upon achievement of specific market conditions. The restricted stock awards also contained certain acceleration clauses if triggering events occur. Half of these awards were subject to vesting if USBTC achieved a total company valuation equal to or greater than $
1
 billion and the other half of these awards were subject to vesting if USBTC achieved a total company valuation equal to or greater than $
2
 billion.

Stock options
The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Prior to the Business Combination, USBTC was a private company and lacked publicly observable company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Therefore, expected stock volatility was estimated based on the historical volatility of a publicly traded set of peer companies. Also, due to the lack of historical exercise history, the expected term of USBTC’s stock options was determined using the “simplified” method for awards, which uses a mid-point between the vesting period and contractual term for each grant and for each vesting-tranche for awards with graded vesting. The risk-free interest rate was determined by referencing the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. An expected dividend yield of 
0
% was based on USBTC not having paid cash dividends historically and not expecting to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
The majority of USBTC’s stock options vested based on service provided by the grantee to USBTC over time; however, certain stock options were also subject to a performance-based vesting condition whereby vesting would be accelerated upon the completion of an initial public offering or merger event (the “IPO Options”).
In January 2022, USBTC modified the former Chief Financial Officer’s stock option award to allow for the conditional vesting of the first tranche of 
79,752
 stock options upon the occurrence of an initial public offering or merger event and the former Chief Financial Officer’s continued service as an advisor to USBTC through such initial public offering or merger event. These stock options would have vested in July 2022 had the former Chief Financial Officer’s employment continued until such time. At the time of the modification, USBTC reversed approximately $
0.1
 million of stock-based compensation expense recognized on the original unvested stock option award and estimated a grant date fair value for the modified award of approximately $
0.9
 million, which was recognized as stock-based compensation expense by USBTC upon the consummation of the Business Combination.
139

Table of Contents
In January 2023, USBTC repriced 
2,122,760
 outstanding stock options to an exercise price of $
0.39
 per share. The incremental expense of vested stock options of approximately $
0.03
 million was recognized upon the modification date and the incremental expense of unvested stock options of $
0.1
 million will be recognized over the remaining vesting period of the awards.
In January 2023, USBTC entered into change in control agreements with 
two
 senior executives that amended the vesting requirement of certain of their service-based stock options. Under the terms of the amended agreements, an acceleration provision was added for all unvested service-based stock options whereby immediate vesting would occur upon the consummation of the Business Combination. USBTC determined the performance condition was probable of being achieved both prior to and subsequent to the modification and accounted for these changes as a Type I modification (probable-to-probable). As the modification only resulted in the acceleration of service-based vesting and did not involve any other changes, there was 
no
 incremental fair value to recognize as additional compensation expense as of the modification date and accordingly 
no
 incremental compensation expense required to be recognized.
In February 2023, USBTC entered into a change in control agreement with a senior executive that modified the performance condition in 
27,367
 of their stock option awards. Under the modified terms, the stock options did not vest upon achievement of certain internal non-financial metrics and instead vested upon the completion of an initial public offering or merger event. USBTC determined the performance condition was not probable of being achieved both prior to and subsequent to the modification (a Type IV modification). Under GAAP, stock compensation expense for equity awards that are conditional upon a liquidity event such as an initial public offering or merger event is not recognizable prior to the achievement of the liquidity event. As such, USBTC did not recognize any stock compensation expense for these stock options until the occurrence of an initial public offering or merger event, and recognized this expense upon the consummation of the Business Combination.
On November 30, 2023, due to the consummation of the Business Combination, USBTC accelerated a total of 
763,609
 unvested performance-based stocks options, which was comprised of the IPO Options and the January 2023 and February 2023 modified performance-based stock options described above. Accordingly, USBTC recognized $
1.1
 million of accelerated compensation expense as of the Business Combination closing date.
Immediately prior to the closing of the Business Combination, 
6,686,123
 USBTC stock options were converted into 
4,490,375
 USBTC Replacement Options, based on an exchange ratio of 
0.6716
, rounded down to the nearest whole stock option at an award level. The exercise price of each USBTC Replacement Option is equal to the exercise price of the replaced USBTC stock option immediately before the Business Combination divided by 
0.6716
, rounded up to the nearest whole cent if applicable. USBTC treated the exchange as a Type I modification (probable-to-probable) and measured the total incremental expense as $
3.9
 million for all vested and unvested stock options. The $
0.3
 million incremental expense associated with the vested awards was recognized immediately upon the exchange and is included in compensation expense in general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (loss) for the six months ended December 31, 2023.
As previously described in this note, in connection with the consummation of the Business Combination, Legacy Hut stock options were cancelled and reissued under the Company’s 2023 Plan at a 
0.2000
 ratio, rounded down if applicable at a grant level. The exercise price of each Legacy Hut stock option immediately before the Business Combination was divided by the exchange ratio of 
0.2000
 rounded up to the nearest whole cent, if applicable, to obtain the exercise price of the replacement stock options. 
115,000
 Legacy Hut stock options were cancelled and 
23,000
 replacement stock options were issued under the 2023 Plan with a weighted-average exercise price of $
18.41
 per share. The weighted-average fair value of these replacement stock options of $
7.02
 per share was estimated as described in this note with the exception of expected stock volatility, where the assumption of the replacement stock options converged with the acquiree awards’ (Legacy Hut stock options) as of the Business Combination consummation; all other assumptions also converged with the acquiree awards’ as of the Business Combination consummation. These 
23,000
 replacement stock options were fully vested on the Business Combination closing date. As such, there is 
no
 further unrecognized compensation expense related to these replacement stock options.

Table of Contents
In August 2024, the Company accelerated the vesting of 
380,658
 stock options held by 
three
 non-employee directors and 
425,604
 stock options held by its CEO to immediately vest. As the modifications only resulted in the acceleration of service-based vesting and did not involve any other changes, there was 
no
 incremental fair value to recognize as additional compensation expense as of the modification date and accordingly 
no
 incremental compensation expense was required to be recognized.
No
 stock options were granted by the Company during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024. The following assumptions were used in determining the fair value of the Legacy Hut stock options reissued under the 2023 Plan and USBTC Replacement Options during the six months ended December 31, 2023.

Restricted stock units
Restricted stock units granted under the 2023 Plan, and those governed under the 2018 Plan that may settle in shares of common stock of the Company, entitle recipients to receive a number of shares of the Company’s common stock over a vesting period, according to each respective restricted stock unit agreement. At the Company’s discretion, restricted stock units may be settled in shares of common stock or cash in lieu of settling in shares or a combination of shares of common stock and cash, and the Company currently does not intend to settle any restricted stock units in cash or in a combination of shares of common stock and cash.
For restricted stock units under the 2023 Plan, stock-based compensation expense related to share-settled restricted stock units is based on the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. For restricted stock units under the 2018 Plan, the stock-based compensation expense is based on the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of the consummation of the Business Combination. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense associated with such share-settled restricted stock unit awards on a graded basis over the awards’ service-based vesting tranches. Share-settled restricted stock unit awards granted up to December 31, 2024 generally vest in equal annual installments over a 
three-year
 period or for non-employee directors, fully vest by a certain date (unless accelerated in connection with a change in control event under specified conditions as set forth in the applicable restricted stock unit agreement or otherwise in accordance with provisions of the award’s governing plan or applicable agreement).
In February 2023, the Company accelerated the vesting of 
66,666
 restricted stock units held by its former Chief Financial Officer governed by the 2018 Plan to dates earlier than the original vest dates. As the modification only resulted in the acceleration of service-based vesting and did not involve any other changes, there was 
no
 incremental fair value to recognize as additional compensation expense as of the modification date and accordingly 
no
 incremental compensation expense required to be recognized.

Deferred stock units
Deferred stock units granted under the 2023 Plan, and those governed under the 2018 Plan that are settleable in shares of common stock of the Company, entitled recipients to receive a number of shares of the Company’s common stock over a vesting period if applicable, as per each respective deferred stock unit agreement. At the Company’s discretion, deferred stock units may be settled in shares of common stock or cash in lieu of settling in shares or a combination of shares of common stock and cash, and the Company currently does not intend to settle any deferred stock units in cash or in a combination of shares of common stock and cash.
For deferred stock units under the 2023 Plan, the stock-based compensation expense related to share-settled deferred stock units is based on the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. For deferred stock units under the 2018 Plan, the stock-based compensation expense is based on the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of the consummation of the Business Combination. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense associated with such share-settled deferred stock unit awards on a graded basis over the awards’ vesting tranches. Share-settled deferred stock unit awards granted to date are granted in vested state and can only be settled for shares of common stock of the Company upon the participant’s departure from the Company.

Performance stock units
Performance stock units granted under the 2023 Plan entitle recipients to receive a number of shares of the Company’s common stock based on market and service conditions as per each respective performance stock unit agreement. At the Company’s discretion, performance stock units may be settled in shares of common stock or cash in lieu of settling in shares or a combination of shares of common stock and cash. The Company currently does not intend to settle any performance stock units in cash or in a combination of shares of common stock and cash. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, the Company awarded 
1,602,609
 market-based and service-based performance stock units to certain employees, including to its CEO, Chief Strategy Officer, Chief Legal Officer, and Chief Financial Officer.
The performance stock units granted as of December 31, 2024 have market-based and service-based vest conditions. These performance stock units vest approximately 
three years
 from grant date and, as set forth in each applicable performance stock unit grant agreement, if the Company’s stock price, on a basis of the highest volume-weighted average stock price of the Company over a 
20
 consecutive trading day period during a certain measurement period, exceeds the Company’s 
20
 consecutive trading day volume-weighted average stock price as of a certain date by at least 
50
% or at least 
100
% (“VWAP Goal”), then the percentage of performance stock units eligible to vest is 
100
% or 
200
% of the number of performance stock units granted, respectively. Any performance stock units that become eligible to vest as per their respective agreements will vest at the end of their required service period. These performance stock units do not have interpolation conditions on the percentage of units that are eligible to vest.
143

Table of Contents
The VWAP Goal is considered a “market condition” under FASB ASC Topic 718, 
Compensation—Stock Compensation
, and as such, the Company used a Monte Carlo simulation model to determine the grant-date fair value of performance stock units with a market condition. The Monte Carlo simulation takes into account the probability that the market condition will be achieved based on predicted stock price paths compared to a publicly traded set of peer companies in addition to the below assumptions:

The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense associated with performance stock unit awards on a graded basis over the awards’ derived service period. Stock-based compensation expense associated with performance stock units is not adjusted in future periods for the success or failure to achieve the specified market conditions. The weighted-average derived service period of performance stock units granted during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 was 
3.0

Note 20. Net income (loss) per share of common stock
Basic and diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders is computed in accordance to Note 2. 
Basis of presentation, summary of significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements
 – Net income (loss) per share of common stock. In addition, as mentioned in Note 18. 
Stockholders’ equity
, a recapitalization of equity structure occurred in a historical period and these Consolidated Financial Statements contain recast stockholders’ equity balances resulting from the retroactive application of recapitalization accounting in accordance with GAAP. As such, the net income (loss) per share of common stock computations below for the historical periods reflects the retroactive application of recapitalization.

The Company does not anticipate a material change to unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months.

The Company has only mined Bitcoin during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, six months ended December 31, 2023, and twelve months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. Therefore, 
100
% of the Company’s digital asset mining revenue within its Compute segment is related to one digital asset. The Company used 
two
 mining pool operators during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and six months ended December 31, 2023. The Company used 
three
 mining pool operators during the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022.

This includes equity method investment entities. Related parties also include principal owners of the Company, its management, members of the immediate families of principal owners of the Company and its management and other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. The Company discloses all known related party transactions.
The Company provides services to TZRC, an equity method investment entity (refer to Note 10.

Legal and regulatory matters
The Company and its subsidiaries are subject at times to various claims, lawsuits and governmental proceedings relating to the Company’s business and transactions arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company cannot predict the final outcome of such proceedings. Where appropriate, the Company vigorously defends such claims, lawsuits and proceedings. Some of these claims, lawsuits and proceedings seek damages, including, consequential, exemplary or punitive damages, in amounts that could, if awarded, be significant. Certain of the claims, lawsuits and proceedings arising in ordinary course of business are covered by the Company’s insurance program. The Company maintains property and various types of liability insurance in an effort to protect the Company from such claims. In terms of any matters where there is no insurance coverage available to the Company, or where coverage is available and the Company maintains a retention or deductible associated with such insurance, the Company may establish an accrual for such loss, retention or deductible based on current available information. In accordance with accounting guidance, if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred as of the date of the financial statements, and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable, then an accrual for the cost to resolve or settle these claims is recorded by the Company in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. If it is reasonably possible that an asset may be impaired as of the date of the financial statement, then the Company discloses the range of possible loss. Expenses related to the defense of such claims are recorded by the Company as incurred and included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). Management, with the assistance of outside counsel, may from time to time adjust such accruals according to new developments in the matter, court rulings, or changes in the strategy affecting the Company’s defense of such matters. On the basis of current information, the Company does not believe there is a reasonable possibility that any material loss will result from any claims, lawsuits and proceedings to which the Company is subject to either individually, or in the aggregate.
Litigation with North Bay facility power provider and leasehold provider
On January 25, 2023, Legacy Hut filed a statement of claim in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice against Validus Power Corp. and Bay Power Corp. as defendants. Legacy Hut’s statement of claim included that defendants failed to meet obligations under a power purchase agreement between the parties. On February 21, 2023, the Company announced that it received a statement of defense and counterclaim. Completion of the Far North Transaction on February 15, 2024, whereby the assets of Validus Power Corp. were acquired by the Company, has resulted in the full and final resolution of all litigation claims and counterclaims made between Legacy Hut and Validus Power Corp.
Lancium, LLC Lawsuit
On May 11, 2023, Lancium, LLC filed a lawsuit claiming that USTBC infringed upon a number of its patents and sought unspecified compensatory damages, treble damages and attorney’s fees and costs. On January 16, 2024, the lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice. 
Securities Litigation
In February and March 2024, two purported securities class actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company and certain of its current and former officers. The two class actions were consolidated into 
In re Hut 8 Corp. Securities Litigation
, case number 24-cv-00904 (VM), and a lead plaintiff was appointed on April 19, 2024. The lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended complaint on June 14, 2024. The consolidated amended complaint alleges violations of Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. On December 2, 2024, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint. On January 16, 2025, the lead plaintiff opposed the motion.  On February 18, 2025, the defendants filed a reply in further support of the motion to dismiss.
149

Table of Contents
Since the filing of the securities class actions, shareholder derivative suits were filed against the Company, its directors and certain of its current and former officers in the U.S. District Courts for the Southern District of New York, the District of Delaware, and the Southern District of Florida alleging derivative claims for breach of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and violations of the Exchange Act, including Section 10(b). All derivative actions in the Southern District of New York were voluntarily dismissed or transferred to the District of Delaware.  All derivative actions in the District of Delaware were voluntarily dismissed or dismissed by the court without prejudice. The Southern District of Florida consolidated and stayed the proceedings before it pending the outcome of the motion to dismiss in the securities class action in the Southern District of New York and administratively closed the case. 
The Company disputes the claims in these cases and intends to vigorously defend against them.  Based on the preliminary nature of these proceedings, the outcome of these matters remains uncertain, and the Company cannot estimate the potential impact, if any, on its business or financial statements at this time.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
None.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the specified time periods. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files and submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to enable timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with the participation of its management, evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that they were not effective as of December 31, 2024. 
150

Table of Contents
The Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, recognizes that any system of disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance rather than absolute assurance of achieving its objectives. The design of a control system must reflect resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation can provide absolute assurance that all control issues or instances of fraud, if any, will be detected. These inherent limitations include the possibility of faulty judgments, errors or mistakes, and the potential for controls to be circumvented by individual acts, collusion among employees, or management override. Moreover, the design of any control system is based on certain assumptions regarding future events, and there is no guarantee that any design will succeed under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions or deterioration in compliance with policies or procedures. Consequently, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2024, based on the criteria set forth in the Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
Under the supervision and participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As part of our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, management identified the following material weaknesses:
●
our control pertaining to the review was not operating effectively as it relates to the calculation of the deferred tax provision for Bitcoin held in an international jurisdiction; and
●
our control pertaining to the review of a complex accounting transaction related to our BITMAIN miner purchase agreement was not operating effectively.
The material weaknesses associated with the operating effectiveness did not result in a material misstatement to our previously issued consolidated financial statements, nor in the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Based on these material weaknesses, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2024. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Raymond Chabot Grant Thornton, has issued an audit report expressing an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Management’s Plan for Remediation
Our Board and management take internal control over financial reporting and the integrity of our financial statements seriously. Management continues to work to improve controls related to the material weaknesses described above. Management will continue to implement measures to remediate the material weaknesses, such that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively.
In order to achieve the timely implementation of the above, Management is taking the following actions:
●
replacing our existing third-party advisor who prepared and supported our review of the deferred taxes calculation with an advisor who has additional expertise in calculating deferred income taxes in the international jurisdictions in which we operate;
●
replacing our existing third-party advisor who supported our review of the BITMAIN miner purchase agreement with an advisor who has additional expertise in Bitcoin-related transactions; and
151

Table of Contents
●
developing and implementing enhanced controls related to the review of certain of our third-party advisors with respect to their review of certain complex transactions.
While these remedial actions are designed to correct the material weaknesses, changes to internal control over financial reporting require operation for a sufficient period of time in order for Management to evaluate and test the operating effectiveness. Management will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the change for a sufficient period of time prior to concluding that these controls are designed and operating effectively, at which time, the material weaknesses can be considered remediated.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Except for the material weaknesses and the remedial measures described above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the year ended December 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
​
Inherent Limitations on Internal Controls
​
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness for future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. No evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
