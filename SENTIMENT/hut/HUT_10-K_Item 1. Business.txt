Hut 8: Where Power Unlocks Potential
Hut 8 is an energy infrastructure platform that integrates power, digital infrastructure, and compute at scale to fuel next-generation, energy-intensive use cases such as Bitcoin mining and high-performance computing (“HPC”). We take a power-first, innovation-driven approach to developing, commercializing, and operating the critical infrastructure that underpins the breakthrough technologies of today and tomorrow.
​
Our Platform
Our platform comprises three layers: Power, Digital Infrastructure, and Compute. Together, these layers form the engine for energy-intensive technologies like Bitcoin mining and HPC (see Exhibit 1). Our integrated model positions us to capitalize on innovation-driven opportunities in an evolving energy and infrastructure landscape. Across our three layers, we strategically allocate resources and capital with the aim of optimizing returns, mitigating sector-specific volatility, enhancing speed to market, and capturing opportunities at multiple stages of the value chain. Our objective is to maximize long-term value creation for stockholders by building and sustaining competitive advantages at each layer while capturing synergies across our broader platform.

Power.
 Power is the foundation of our platform. We acquire, develop, and manage critical energy assets such as interconnects, powered land, and other electrical infrastructure to address the load demands of energy-intensive applications such as Bitcoin mining and HPC. As of December 31, 2024, our Power layer comprised 1,020 megawatts (“MW”) of energy capacity under management across 15 sites in the United States and Canada, which consists of energy assets that we own, lease, or manage for third parties.
The value of high-quality energy assets continues to rise as demand grows to support both current and emerging technologies while supply remains stagnant or subscale. To meet this increasing demand, our strategy focuses on maximizing the scale of our Power layer, monetizing each megawatt in our portfolio with the use case we believe will drive the highest returns and value creation, and optimizing yield over time through value creation initiatives such as the transition of sites to new use cases. To meet both current and future demand, we continue to build and advance a scaled development pipeline. Capacity from this pipeline converts to energy capacity under management upon the execution of a purchase or lease agreement. As of December 31, 2024, our development pipeline comprised approximately 12,300 MW of energy capacity, with approximately 2,800 MW under exclusivity (see Exhibit 2).

A power-first, innovation-driven approach differentiates us from traditional data center operators, who have historically treated power acquisition as an afterthought in the digital infrastructure development process (see Exhibit 3). Our power-native team is the cornerstone of this approach, leveraging decades of collective experience at leading generation owners, utilities, and other players across the energy ecosystem to execute a disciplined development strategy. Equipped with a deep understanding of the electrical grid and its regulatory idiosyncrasies across regions as well as the demands of our load profiles and their impact on energy markets, we seek to identify and secure what we believe to be the most attractive development opportunities in the market—optimizing for scale, cost, speed to market, and long-term value creation potential.
​
Our management team has extensive experience across the energy, digital infrastructure, and technology sectors, with a track record of advising and partnering with major energy generation owners and utilities in power origination, commercialization, and strategic transactions. Our board of directors (the “Board”) includes current and former senior executives and advisors from a variety of relevant industries, including some of the largest energy generation and financial services companies in North America. Across our organization, we have many decades of collective experience across the development and commercialization value chain from leading companies across the energy sector, including NextEra Energy, Constellation Energy, Exelon Corporation, Clearway Energy, Invenergy, ACCIONA, J.P. Morgan, Citigroup Energy, and GE Capital.

Digital Infrastructure. 
The second layer of our platform is Digital Infrastructure. We design, build, monetize, and operate purpose-built facilities for energy-intensive applications with the aim of maximizing long-term returns from our Power layer. We seek to monetize each asset in our Power portfolio through a targeted, asset-by-asset approach, mirroring the model of a private equity firm managing a diverse portfolio of independent businesses underpinned by a single thesis and platform. We believe this approach enables us to maximize the return potential of individual projects while maintaining flexibility across our broader platform and mitigating secular market risk for the Company. As of December 31, 2024, our Digital Infrastructure layer comprised five Bitcoin mining data centers, five HPC data centers, and one non-operational site (see Exhibit 4). Looking forward, as markets and technologies evolve, our Digital Infrastructure layer may expand beyond its current focus areas, supporting emerging applications and diversifying our portfolio into other types of infrastructure.

Developing data centers for Bitcoin mining ASIC compute is a cornerstone of our power-first strategy, allowing us to scale our Power layer aggressively while preserving the flexibility to potentially transition assets to other high-value use cases in the future. Historically, our deep expertise in rapidly deploying low-cost Bitcoin mining infrastructure development has enabled us to energize sites within three months of breaking ground, including a site initially energized in 78 days at an all-in development cost of approximately $250,000 per megawatt, driving rapid payback periods and strong unlevered returns. Bitcoin mining developments allow us to quickly monetize power assets even in scenarios where those assets are not suitable for traditional data center workloads like AI compute in the short term due to longer commercialization timelines, land constraints, load capacity dynamics, or restricted fiber access. In essence, suitable sites can begin their lives as Bitcoin mining data centers with the potential to be repurposed for other, higher return workloads in the future, enabling us to immediately capture upside while maximizing the long-term yield of each Power asset in our portfolio. 
We believe our ability to rapidly monetize and scale our Power layer through Bitcoin mining gives us a structural advantage relative to markets with more complex commercialization dynamics. Our agility in capital deployment and power monetization reinforces our ability to secure attractive development opportunities and expand our footprint often faster and more cost-efficiently than developers constrained by traditional data center development cycles.

Table of Contents
Equally important to our power-first approach to digital infrastructure development is our focus on greenfield development, which has historically enabled us to design, build, and scale Bitcoin mining infrastructure with significant cost and speed advantages over traditional outsourced models. Our development model is driven by a robust in-house team with end-to-end expertise in engineering, procurement, and construction. By limiting our reliance on third-party developers, we reduce vendor dependencies, mitigate the risk of supply chain bottlenecks, and retain control over project design, cost, and execution. With a focus on innovation and value engineering, we aim to iterate on design and construction methodologies in real time to drive continued improvements in infrastructure flexibility, performance, capital efficiency, and returns.
​
Case study: How Bitcoin mining enables rapid, cost-efficient power acquisition
​
In early 2024, we began diligence on our Vega site in Texas, a large-scale, behind-the-meter asset with an existing substation and immediate access to some of the lowest locational wholesale power prices in North America. While the site was potentially attractive for an HPC data center, a contractual requirement to begin consuming power by Q2 2025 would have created an unrealistic timeline for an HPC data center project. To meet this deadline, we underwrote Vega as a Tier I data center for Bitcoin mining ASIC compute, enabling us to secure the site and begin development rapidly. Today, we are on track to energize Vega by Q2 2025, less than a year after acquiring the site, for an all-in development cost of less than $400,000 per megawatt and expect to generate approximately $125 million in annualized revenue through a Bitcoin mining colocation agreement at the site. Importantly, we retain the flexibility to repurpose the site for other applications to optimize long-term value.
We monetize projects in our Digital Infrastructure layer under various models, including joint ventures and hosting or colocation. Under a hosting or colocation model, we either contract with a third-party customer or, in certain cases, simulate the role of a customer for internal purposes. While the latter does not constitute customer revenue from a financial reporting perspective, it enables us to establish an in-house testing environment free from the demands and risks associated with traditional customer contracts. This approach allows us to focus on value engineering and innovation throughout the project lifecycle. This includes testing new products and technologies, piloting new design, development, and operating processes, and gathering operational insights post-energization. We can then apply these innovations and process optimizations to new projects or scale them across our existing portfolio to target higher returns on our Power and Digital Infrastructure assets.
Compute. 
The third layer of our platform is Compute. We acquire, monetize, and operate specialized hardware for energy-intensive technologies like Bitcoin mining and HPC, which includes the sales of cloud services to third-party customers. As of December 31, 2024, our compute layer comprised 5.5 exahash per second (“EH/s”) of Bitcoin self-mining capacity and 1,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs for AI compute, operated through our GPU-as-a-Service subsidiary, Highrise AI.
Through our Compute layer, we build deep, firsthand expertise in the technologies addressed by our Digital Infrastructure layer in addition to capturing the economics offered by emerging markets like Bitcoin mining and HPC. By acquiring, operating, and monetizing specialized hardware, such as ASICs for Bitcoin mining and GPUs for HPC, we generate valuable operational data and insights that enable us to optimize the design, development, and operations of our digital infrastructure. This iterative process enables us to enhance performance, improve cost efficiency, and drive stronger returns over time (see Exhibit 5).

Exhibit 5: Illustrative feedback loop between our compute and digital infrastructure layers
​
As technology continues to evolve, so too may opportunities within our Compute layer. The applications that deliver the highest returns from our Power and Digital Infrastructure layers today may shift as new, energy-intensive technologies emerge. By actively monitoring these developments and maintaining a long-term perspective when securing Power assets and building our Digital Infrastructure layer, we aim to ensure our platform is agile, responsive to change, and independent of any single market driver. Our goal is to capitalize on these opportunities, sustain growth, and remain at the forefront of innovation well into the future.

Other.
 We continuously evaluate opportunities to leverage our expertise in power, digital infrastructure, and compute to enhance our risk-adjusted returns. While our primary focus remains on the three core layers of our platform, we may expand into complementary business lines that align with our strategic capabilities. Our Other reporting segment includes activities that fall outside the scope of our Power, Digital Infrastructure, and Compute layers. Revenue from this segment is currently generated through Equipment Sales and Repairs.
Our Focus on Innovation
We take an application-agnostic approach to digital infrastructure development. Our development framework centers on a tiered classification system based on redundancy and resiliency levels, rather than specific applications like Bitcoin mining or AI workloads. An application-agnostic approach allows us to innovate and deliver scalable, value-engineered solutions designed to support a range of current and future applications.
​
Today, our strategic focus is on developing infrastructure at both ends of our development framework. At one end are data centers built to support GPUs for HPC workloads, where uptime, resiliency, and redundancy are critical. These facilities require significant capital investment and are designed to meet the stringent requirements of mission-critical applications. At the other end are data centers for ASIC compute, where lower capital requirements and minimal redundancy requirements make low operating costs and rapid deployment the priority. 
​
With extensive experience across the data center development value chain, we take a first-principles approach to innovation with the goal of delivering superior solutions to our end markets and customers. Our integrated model, spanning Power, Digital Infrastructure, and Compute, positions us to generate deep operational insight into the technical and commercial challenges that drive infrastructure design and performance. This end-to-end expertise allows us to develop and implement innovations that enhance performance, reduce costs, and enhance the flexibility of our digital infrastructure layer.
​
Case study: Pioneering a new data center form factor for Bitcoin mining ASIC compute
​
​
​
At our Vega site, we are pioneering a new data center form factor that challenges conventional assumptions about Bitcoin mining infrastructure and narrows the gap between Bitcoin mining and HPC data center architecture. Historically, data centers designed for Bitcoin mining relied on shelf-based deployments and forced-air cooling, making them suitable for ASIC compute but incompatible with workloads like GPU compute, which rely on rack-based deployments and, increasingly, liquid cooling. This architecture constrained infrastructure flexibility, limited potential applications, and left significant efficiency gains untapped. With our Vega project, we are disrupting this paradigm. The custom infrastructure we developed and engineered in-house for the project features high-density racks, direct-to-chip liquid cooling, and HVAC-supported air cooling. Inspired by traditional data center architecture but optimized for the economics and deployment speed of our agile Bitcoin mining infrastructure developments, this design will enable Vega to support rack-based deployments of ASIC compute at densities of 180 kilowatts per rack, surpassing even the 120-kilowatt density required by NVIDIA’s latest Blackwell GPUs. And, despite these innovations, we expect to build Vega for less than $400,000 per megawatt, a fraction of traditional data center costs, within nine months of breaking ground.
​
Case study: Developing and commercializing a next-generation ASIC miner
​
​
​
We partnered with BITMAIN Technologies Ltd. (“BITMAIN”), the world’s leading manufacturer of digital currency mining servers, to develop and launch the U3S21EXPH ASIC miner, an integral input in the design and commercialization of a new Bitcoin mining data center form factor. The U3S21EXPH will be the first ASIC miner mass-commercialized by BITMAIN to feature direct liquid-to-chip cooling in a U form factor, allowing for high-density deployments of ASIC compute in the rack-based architecture we developed for Vega.

Case study: Energizing a greenfield Bitcoin mining data center with custom containers in 78 days 
​
​
​
In Q1 2022, after acquiring 60 acres of land in West Texas, USBTC designed, developed, and energized Bravo, a 42 MW Bitcoin mining data center, in just 78 days at an all-in cost of approximately $350,000 per MW. This project was an early proof point of our innovation-driven approach. Rather than following the outsourced development model common among operators, we designed and built the site from the ground up, optimizing for speed, cost efficiency, and long-term performance. A key differentiator was our collaboration with a manufacturer to develop custom-modified containers engineered for the environmental conditions of West Texas, including extreme heat and dust exposure. These enhancements improved cooling, airflow, and operational efficiency, ultimately leading the manufacturer to mass-commercialize the design based on our innovations. Bravo established our internal benchmark for rapid, cost-effective infrastructure deployment, a standard we further advanced with our Salt Creek project, which we completed at an all-in cost of approximately $250,000 per MW.

​
​
Our Technology-Driven Operating Philosophy
​
We have adopted a technology-driven operating philosophy, implementing scalable, data-driven processes that enhance the efficiency of our human capital, decrease operating expenses, and reduce the marginal costs of expanding our operations. To support these objectives, we have developed a proprietary software suite comprising three specialized applications (see Exhibit 6). Recognizing that energy costs represent a significant component of our overall cost structure, we have also established a dedicated data science function focused on developing advanced decision-making algorithms at the server level. This team uses thorough profitability modeling to guide curtailment decisions, optimize energy consumption, and improve returns within our Compute layer.

Case study: How Reactor optimizes energy consumption and drives Compute layer returns
​
​
​
As mining economics continue to evolve, our objective is to optimize profitability and returns rather than less meaningful headline metrics like hashrate and fleet efficiency. Factors such as the deployment of new, higher-breakeven machines, which increase energy costs per unit of Bitcoin mined, and Bitcoin network halving events, which reduce block rewards, make efficiency and power optimization critical to driving returns from our Compute layer. To offset self-mining gross margin compression following the Bitcoin network halving in April 2024, we leveraged Reactor, our proprietary energy curtailment software, to dynamically manage power consumption across our sites. This supported a ~28% decline in our average energy cost per kilowatt-hour (kWh), from $0.040 in Q1 2024 to $0.029 in Q3 2024, enabling us to preserve self-mining economics in a post-halving environment.

Our Investment Approach
​
We invest in power, digital infrastructure, and compute assets that we believe will generate strong risk-adjusted returns, strengthen our competitive position, and drive long-term shareholder value creation. Our investment approach is defined by rigorous underwriting, disciplined capital allocation, and active portfolio management. As we expand and diversify our business, we expect that more predictable and financeable, lower-cost-of-capital segments will form a larger share of our revenue mix.
​
Underwriting and Diligence. 
Before deploying capital, we generally undertake a comprehensive, data-driven due diligence process to evaluate risk-adjusted returns across financial, operational, commercial, legal, macroeconomic, and geopolitical dimensions. Our framework incorporates scenario modeling, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis to quantify downside risk and assess long-term value creation potential. Across our platform, we generally invest only when expected returns are projected to meet or exceed disciplined thresholds for value creation. Beyond financial metrics, we prioritize opportunities that support our broader strategic objectives, enhance operational performance, and strengthen our competitive differentiation. Each opportunity is assessed for its potential to unlock platform synergies, drive scalable efficiencies, and reinforce our competitive position.
​
Portfolio Management. 
We take an active approach to portfolio management, driven by a dedicated portfolio management team that works cross-functionally to identify and address both asset-level and platform-wide value creation opportunities. Our approach includes targeted initiatives such as infrastructure upgrades, land expansion, and site-level use case transition. We leverage real-time energy market intelligence and analytics to optimize power costs, mitigate against volatility, and capitalize on arbitrage opportunities. We also maintain active engagement with governing bodies and grid operators to navigate regulatory complexities and to ensure the long-term reliability of our power assets and the grid. 
​
Our Capital Strategy
​
Our capital strategy centers on two objectives: securing the lowest possible cost of capital and minimizing enterprise risk. We aim to maintain a robust, liquid balance sheet that enables us to explore creative financing approaches and prioritize non-dilutive sources of funding whenever possible.
​
Financing.

We strive to optimize our cost of capital by taking a disciplined approach to capital formation and leveraging a range of financing instruments at the corporate and project levels. At the corporate level, we aim to balance equity issuance with strategic leverage in alignment with our view of the Company’s intrinsic value. While we remain sensitive to dilution, we recognize the importance of retaining the flexibility to raise capital when compelling growth opportunities arise or when market conditions are favorable. To support this, we employ tools such as at-the-market (“ATM”) and share buyback programs, which we view as strategic levers to optimize stockholder value and enhance our ability to navigate market volatility. These tools enable us to fund growth initiatives and navigate the markets in which we operate. At the project level, we structure financing to align with the distinct objectives and needs of each opportunity we pursue. While traditional project financing has historically been unavailable for Bitcoin mining infrastructure development, we believe it is a viable option as we expand into HPC data center development.
​
Treasury Management.

Our treasury management strategy aims to enhance balance sheet flexibility and optimize capital efficiency as we pursue capital-intensive growth initiatives such as digital infrastructure development. A key component of our proactive approach to treasury management is our strategic Bitcoin reserve, which totaled 10,171 Bitcoin with a market value of $949.5 million as of December 31, 2024. Built primarily through a fundamentals-driven production strategy, our holdings serve as a flexible asset that can be monetized through options strategies, pledges, sales, or other mechanisms to optimize return on invested capital. We make decisions to utilize Bitcoin held in reserve on a case-by-case basis. By aligning our capital and operating strategies, our reserve is designed to create a flywheel effect that accelerates value creation across the business (see Exhibit 7).

Our Team
​
We aim to attract top talent and provide an environment where our teams are inspired to do their best work. We had 222 full-time employees in the United States and Canada as of December 31, 2024. We also hire part-time employees, temporary employees, or consultants as necessary, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
​
Competition
​
Driven by the proliferation of energy-intensive applications such as Bitcoin mining and HPC, demand for energy capacity continues to outpace supply. For example, HPC workloads require high-density infrastructure with capacity demands multiples greater than many legacy data centers can provide, while Bitcoin mining remains a competitive market that requires operational efficiency and low-cost energy at scale. At the same time, grid interconnection bottlenecks have further constrained access to power and digital infrastructure development, while supply chain disruptions and regulatory constraints have extended lead times for critical infrastructure, including GPUs, ASICs, turbines, generators, and transformers. 
​
In this supply-constrained environment, we believe success depends on the ability to secure scarce assets like power, data center equipment, and customers. We compete with digital infrastructure developers and large-scale Bitcoin miners for access to powered land and key inputs for facility development, such as building materials, data center equipment, and skilled labor. Additionally, we compete with cloud services providers and digital infrastructure developers for customers and specialized hardware. Within Bitcoin Mining, we participate in mining pools that compete for block rewards. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Operations—We may not be able to compete effectively against our current and future competitors.” 
​
Nonetheless, we believe we have established a defensible competitive advantage through our power-first, innovation-driven strategy, which is underpinned by a power-native team with deep access to power markets, an application-agnostic framework for digital infrastructure design, end-to-end greenfield development capabilities, and our ability to use Bitcoin mining infrastructure development to rapidly and cost-effectively secure and monetize power. 
​
Customers and Partners
​
We provide cloud and colocation services to customers across technology, financial services, government, media, and other industries. As of December 31, 2024, we served over 250 customers through our five enterprise-grade data centers in Canada.
​

Table of Contents
At the corporate level, we actively seek to partner with developers of digital infrastructure and large-scale consumers of load capacity, leveraging our expertise in power-intensive computing to drive infrastructure expansion and efficiency. Our current partners include a Fortune 200 energy generation company, a multinational financial services firm, and a leading institutional investor. For example, in June 2024, we received a strategic investment from a fund managed by Coatue Management, L.L.C. (“Coatue”) to support the build-out of AI infrastructure and in September 2024, we launched a next-generation ASIC miner, developed in collaboration with BITMAIN as part of a broader technological and commercial innovation partnership. 
​
Intellectual Property
​
We actively use specialized hardware and software for our operations. In some instances, source code and other software assets may be subject to an open-source license, as much technology development in this sector is open source. We intend to adhere to the terms of any license agreements that may be in place for these works.
​
We rely upon intellectual property protections, including trade secrets, trademarks, and copyright, and license the use of intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others. We have submitted one non-provisional patent, which is currently under review by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. In addition, we have developed and may further develop specific proprietary hardware, software applications, or other intellectual property, and may choose to seek patents or other protections in the future.
​
Regulatory Landscape 
​
The laws and regulations applicable to our offerings are evolving and subject to interpretation and change. We operate in a complex and rapidly evolving regulatory environment and we are subject to a wide range of laws and regulations enacted by federal, state, provincial, and local governments, governmental agencies, and regulatory authorities, including the SEC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”), the Federal Trade Commission, and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“FinCEN”), as well as similar entities in Canada and other countries. Other regulatory bodies, governmental or semi-governmental, have shown an interest in regulating or investigating companies engaged in the blockchain or digital asset businesses.
​
For example, businesses that are engaged in the transmission and custody of Bitcoin and other digital assets, including brokers and custodians, can be subject to FinCEN regulations as money services businesses as well as state money transmitter licensing requirements. The potential application of these policies to Bitcoin mining continues to evolve. 
​
Bitcoin and other digital assets are subject to anti-fraud regulations under federal and state commodity and/or securities laws, and digital asset derivative instruments are regulated by the CFTC and SEC. Certain jurisdictions, including, among others, New York, and a number of countries other than the United States, have developed regulatory requirements specifically for digital assets and companies that transact in them. Furthermore, regulations may substantially change in the future and it is presently not possible to know how regulations will apply to our business, or when they will be effective. For example, in January 2025, the SEC announced the launch of a new crypto task force focused on developing a regulatory framework for crypto assets and related goals. In addition, the recent U.S. presidential election and change of administration could have a significant impact on the digital asset industry and our business in the United States. For example, in January 2025, the President signed an Executive Order titled “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology,” which, among other things, stated that the current administration’s policy will be “to support the responsible growth and use of digital assets, blockchain technology, and related technologies across all sectors of the economy” by “providing regulatory clarity and certainty” regarding digital assets and blockchain technologies.

As the regulatory and legal environment evolves, we may become subject to new laws and regulations, which may affect Bitcoin mining and other activities. For instance, various bills have been proposed in the U.S. Congress related to our offerings, which may be adopted and have an impact on us. In January 2023, the U.S. House of Representatives announced its first ever Financial Services Subcommittee on Digital Assets and its intention to develop a regulatory framework for the digital asset industry. Bipartisan leadership of the Senate Banking Committee announced that goal as well. The U.S. Treasury Department has also requested additional authorities to address such risks.
