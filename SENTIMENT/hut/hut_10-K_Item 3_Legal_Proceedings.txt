However, we are subject to regulatory oversight by numerous federal, state, provincial, local, and other regulators and we are, and we may become, subject to various legal proceedings, inquiries, investigations, and demand letters that arise in the course of our business.

Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
Market Information for Common Stock
Our common stock is listed on Nasdaq and the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol “HUT.”
Holders of Record
As of February 28, 2025, there were 49 holders of record of our common stock. Because many of our shares of common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders.
Dividend Policy
We have never declared or paid dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business and execute our strategic initiatives. As a result, we do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our Board and will depend on, among other things, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements and availability, industry trends, and other factors that the Board may deem relevant. Any such decision also will be subject to compliance with contractual restrictions and covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness. 
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
None.
Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
Except as previously reported in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 1, 2024, there were no unregistered sales of equity securities by us during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024.
