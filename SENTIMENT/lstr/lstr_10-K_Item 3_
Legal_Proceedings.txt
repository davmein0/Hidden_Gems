Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 

The Common Stock of the Company is listed and traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “LSTR.” 

The reported last sale price per share of the Common Stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on January 24, 2025 was $173.04 per share. As of such date, Landstar had 35,316,073 shares of Common Stock outstanding and had 136 stockholders of record of its Common Stock. However, the Company estimates that it has a significantly greater number of stockholders because a substantial number of the Company’s shares are held by brokers or dealers for their customers in street name.

Introduction 

Landstar System, Inc. and its subsidiary, Landstar System Holdings, Inc. (collectively referred to herein with their subsidiaries and other affiliated companies as “Landstar” or the “Company”), is a technology-enabled, asset-light provider of integrated transportation management solutions delivering safe, specialized transportation services to a broad range of customers utilizing a network of agents, third party capacity providers and employees. The Company offers services to its customers across multiple transportation modes, with the ability to arrange for individual shipments of freight to comprehensive third party logistics solutions to meet all of a customer’s transportation needs. Landstar provides services principally throughout the United States and to a lesser extent in Canada and Mexico, and between the United States and Canada, Mexico and other countries around the world. The Company’s services emphasize safety, information coordination and customer service and are delivered through a network of approximately 1,050 independent commission sales agents and over 78,000 third party capacity providers, primarily truck capacity providers, linked together by a series of digital technologies which are provided and coordinated by the Company. The nature of the Company’s business is such that a significant portion of its operating costs varies directly with revenue. 

Landstar markets its integrated transportation management solutions primarily through independent commission sales agents and exclusively utilizes third party capacity providers to transport customers’ freight. Landstar’s independent commission sales agents enter into contractual arrangements with the Company and are responsible for locating freight, making that freight available to Landstar’s capacity providers and coordinating the transportation of the freight with customers and capacity providers. The Company’s third party capacity providers consist of independent contractors who provide truck capacity to the Company under exclusive lease arrangements (the “BCO Independent Contractors”), unrelated trucking companies who provide truck capacity to the Company under non-exclusive contractual arrangements (the “Truck Brokerage Carriers”), air cargo carriers, ocean cargo carriers and railroads. Through this network of agents and capacity providers linked together by Landstar’s ecosystem of digital technologies, Landstar operates an integrated transportation management solutions business primarily throughout North America with revenue of $4.8 billion during the most recently completed fiscal year. The Company reports the results of two operating segments: the transportation logistics segment and the insurance segment. 

The transportation logistics segment provides a wide range of integrated transportation management solutions. Transportation services are provided by Landstar’s “Operating Subsidiaries”: Landstar Ranger, Inc., Landstar Inway, Inc., Landstar Ligon, Inc., Landstar Gemini, Inc., Landstar Transportation Logistics, Inc., Landstar Global Logistics, Inc., Landstar Express America, Inc., Landstar Canada, Inc., Landstar Metro, S.A.P.I. de C.V., and Landstar Blue, LLC. Transportation services offered by the Company include truckload, less-than-truckload and other truck transportation, rail intermodal, air cargo, ocean cargo, expedited ground and air

Table of Contents

delivery of time-critical freight, heavy-haul/specialized, cold chain/temperature-controlled, U.S.-Canada and U.S.-Mexico cross-border, intra-Mexico, intra-Canada, project cargo and customs brokerage. Examples of the industries serviced by the transportation logistics segment include automotive parts and assemblies, consumer durables, building products, metals, chemicals, foodstuffs, heavy machinery, retail, electronics and military equipment and general commodities. In addition, the transportation logistics segment provides transportation services to other transportation companies, including third party logistics and less-than-truckload service providers. The independent commission sales agents market services provided by the transportation logistics segment. Billings for freight transportation services are typically charged to customers on a per shipment basis for the physical transportation of freight and are referred to as transportation revenue. During fiscal year 2024, revenue generated by BCO Independent Contractors, Truck Brokerage Carriers and railroads represented approximately 38%, 52% and 2%, respectively, of the Company’s consolidated revenue. Collectively, revenue generated by air and ocean cargo carriers represented approximately 6% of the Company’s consolidated revenue during fiscal year 2024. 

The insurance segment is comprised of Signature Insurance Company (“Signature”), a wholly owned offshore insurance subsidiary, and Risk Management Claim Services, Inc. The insurance segment provides risk and claims management services to certain of Landstar’s Operating Subsidiaries. In addition, it reinsures certain risks of the Company’s BCO Independent Contractors and provides certain property and casualty insurance and reinsurance to certain of Landstar’s Operating Subsidiaries. Revenue at the insurance segment represents reinsurance premiums from third party insurance companies that provide insurance programs to BCO Independent Contractors where all or a portion of the risk is ultimately borne by Signature. Revenue at the insurance segment represented approximately 1% of the Company’s consolidated revenue for fiscal year 2024. 

Changes in Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Management believes the Company’s success principally depends on its ability to generate freight through its network of independent commission sales agents and to deliver freight safely and efficiently utilizing third party capacity providers. Management believes the most significant factors to the Company’s success include increasing revenue, sourcing capacity, empowering its network through technology-based tools and controlling costs, including insurance and claims. 

Revenue 

While customer demand, which is subject to overall economic conditions, ultimately drives increases or decreases in revenue, the Company primarily relies on its independent commission sales agents to establish customer relationships and generate revenue opportunities. Management’s emphasis with respect to revenue growth is on revenue generated by independent commission sales agents who on an annual basis generate $1 million or more of Landstar revenue. Management believes future revenue growth is primarily dependent on its ability to increase both the revenue generated by Million Dollar Agents and the number of Million Dollar Agents through a combination of recruiting new agents, increasing the revenue opportunities generated by existing independent commission sales agents and providing its independent commission sales agents with digital technologies they may use to grow revenue and increase efficiencies at their businesses. The following table shows the number of Million Dollar Agents, the average revenue generated by these agents and the percent of consolidated revenue generated by these agents during the past three fiscal years:

In fiscal year 2024, the change in the number of Million Dollar Agents was primarily attributable to agents who remained with the Company yet experienced lower year-over-year revenue that resulted in such agents moving below the Million Dollar Agent category due to the softer freight demand environment. Included among the Company’s Million Dollar Agents in the 2024 fiscal year, the Company had 81 independent sales agencies that generated at least $10 million in Landstar revenue. In fiscal year 2023, the change in the number of Million Dollar Agents was attributable to agents who remained with the Company yet experienced lower year-over-year revenue that resulted in such agents moving below the Million Dollar Agent category due to the softer freight demand environment. Included among the Company’s Million Dollar Agents in the 2023 fiscal year, the Company had 87 independent sales agencies that generated at least $10 million in Landstar revenue. 

The change in the number of Million Dollar Agents on a year-over-year basis is influenced by many factors and is not solely the result of terminations of contractual relationships between agents and the Company, whether such terminations are initiated by the agent or the Company. Such other factors include consolidations among agencies or transactions in connection with ownership

changes often due to retirement planning, estate planning or similar transitional matters. The change in the number of Million Dollar Agents on a year-over-year basis may also be affected by agents that remain with the Company yet experienced lower year-over-year revenue that resulted in such agent moving below the Million Dollar Agent category. Historically, the Company has experienced very few terminations of its Million Dollar Agents, whether such terminations are initiated by the agent or the Company. Annual terminations of Million Dollar Agents have typically been less than 3% of the total number of Million Dollar Agents. Revenue from accounts formerly handled by terminated Million Dollar Agents is often retained by the Company as the customer may choose to transfer its account to an existing Landstar agent.

Management monitors business activity by tracking the number of loads (volume) and revenue per load by mode of transportation. Revenue per load can be influenced by many factors other than a change in price. Those factors include the average length of haul, freight type, special handling and equipment requirements, fuel costs and delivery time requirements. For shipments involving two or more modes of transportation, revenue is generally classified by the mode of transportation having the highest cost for the load. The following table summarizes this information by trailer type for truck transportation and by mode for all others for the past three fiscal years:

Active refers to Truck Brokerage Carriers who moved at least one load in the 180 days immediately preceding the fiscal year end. 

Purchased transportation represents the amount a BCO Independent Contractor or other third party capacity provider is paid to haul freight. The amount of purchased transportation paid to a BCO Independent Contractor is primarily based on a contractually agreed-upon percentage of revenue generated by loads hauled by the BCO Independent Contractor. Purchased transportation paid to a Truck Brokerage Carrier is based on either a negotiated rate for each load hauled or, to a lesser extent, a contractually agreed-upon fixed rate per load. Purchased transportation paid to railroads and ocean cargo carriers is based on either a negotiated rate for each load hauled or a contractually agreed-upon fixed rate per load. Purchased transportation paid to air cargo carriers is generally based on a negotiated rate for each load hauled. Purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue for truck brokerage, rail intermodal and ocean cargo services is normally higher than that of BCO Independent Contractor and air cargo services. Purchased transportation is the largest component of costs and expenses and, on a consolidated basis, increases or decreases as a percentage of consolidated revenue in proportion to changes in the percentage of consolidated revenue generated through BCO Independent Contractors and other third party capacity providers and external revenue from the insurance segment, consisting of reinsurance premiums. Purchased transportation as a percent of revenue also increases or decreases in relation to the availability of truck brokerage capacity and with changes in the price of fuel on revenue generated from shipments hauled by Truck Brokerage Carriers. The Company passes 100% of fuel surcharges billed to customers for freight hauled by BCO Independent Contractors to its BCO Independent Contractors. These fuel surcharges are excluded from revenue and the cost of purchased transportation. Purchased transportation costs are recognized over the freight transit period as the performance obligation to the customer is completed. 

Commissions to agents 

Commissions to agents are based on contractually agreed-upon percentages of (i) revenue, (ii) revenue less the cost of purchased transportation, or (iii) revenue less a contractually agreed upon percentage of revenue retained by Landstar and the cost of purchased transportation (the “retention contracts”). Commissions to agents as a percentage of consolidated revenue vary directly with fluctuations in the percentage of consolidated revenue generated by the various modes of transportation and reinsurance premiums and, in general, vary inversely with changes in the amount of purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue on services provided by Truck Brokerage Carriers, railroads, air cargo carriers and ocean cargo carriers. Commissions to agents are recognized over the freight transit period as the performance obligation to the customer is completed. 

Other operating costs, net of gains on asset sales/dispositions 

Maintenance costs for Company-provided trailing equipment, the provision for uncollectible advances and other receivables due from BCO Independent Contractors and independent commission sales agents and recruiting and qualification costs for BCO Independent Contractors are the largest components of other operating costs. Also included in other operating costs are trailer rental costs and gains/losses, if any, on sales of Company-owned trailing equipment. 

Insurance and claims 

With respect to insurance and claims cost, potential liability associated with accidents in the trucking industry is severe and occurrences are unpredictable. 

27 

Table of Contents

Landstar retains liability through a self-insured retention for commercial trucking claims up to $5 million per occurrence. Effective May 1, 2023, the Company entered into a three year commercial auto liability insurance arrangement for losses incurred between $5 million and $10 million (the “2023 Initial Excess Policy”) with a third party insurance company. For commercial trucking claims incurred on or after May 1, 2023 through April 30, 2026, the 2023 Initial Excess Policy provides for an aggregate deductible of $18 million over the thirty-six-month term ending April 30, 2026. After payment of the deductible, the 2023 Initial Excess Policy provides for a limit for a single loss of $5 million, with an aggregate limit of $15 million for the thirty-six-month term ending April 30, 2026. 

The Company also maintains third party insurance arrangements providing excess coverage for commercial trucking liabilities in excess of $10 million. These third party arrangements provide coverage on a per occurrence or aggregated basis. Over the past decade, there has been a significant increase in the prevalence of trials in courts throughout the United States involving catastrophic injury and fatality claims against commercial motor carriers that have resulted in verdicts in excess of $10 million. Within the transportation logistics industry, these verdicts are often referred to as “Nuclear Verdicts.” The increase in Nuclear Verdicts has had a significant impact on the cost of commercial auto liability claims throughout the United States. Due to the increasing cost of commercial auto liability claims, the availability of excess coverage has significantly decreased, and the pricing associated with such excess coverage, to the extent available, has significantly increased. Since the annual policy year ended April 30, 2020, as compared to the annual policy year ending April 30, 2025, the Company experienced an increase of approximately $22 million, or over 400%, in the premiums charged by third party insurance companies to the Company for excess coverage for commercial trucking liabilities in excess of $10 million. 

Moreover, the Company from year to year manages the level of its financial exposure to commercial trucking claims in excess of $10 million, including through the use of additional self-insurance, deductibles, aggregate loss limits, quota shares and other structured arrangements with third party insurance companies, based on the availability of coverage within certain excess insurance coverage layers and estimated cost differentials between proposed premiums from third party insurance companies and historical and actuarially projected losses experienced by the Company at various levels of excess insurance coverage. For example, with respect to a single hypothetical claim in the amount of $65 million incurred during the annual policy year ending April 30, 2025, the Company would have an aggregate financial exposure of approximately $30 million. 

Within the Company’s third party insurance arrangements providing excess coverage for commercial trucking liabilities, structured arrangements with third party reinsurers within a specific loss layer may include provisions that require additional payments of premium in the event of unfavorable loss experience or a refund of premium in the event of favorable loss experience. With respect to one such three year commercial auto liability reinsurance arrangement relating to certain excess claims incurred between May 1, 2020 through April 30, 2023, it is anticipated that during the 2025 second fiscal quarter, the Company will receive a $12,000,000 cash payment from a third party reinsurance provider in the form of a “no claims bonus” due to favorable loss experience with respect to claims incurred during the policy period. The Company intends to record the receipt of this payment as a deferred gain on the balance sheet until such time as all underlying claims with exposure under the applicable excess layer insurance arrangement are resolved and the gain can be recognized. 

Furthermore, the Company’s third party insurance arrangements provide excess coverage up to an uppermost coverage layer, in excess of which the Company retains additional financial exposure. No assurances can be given that the availability of excess coverage for commercial trucking claims will not continue to deteriorate, that the pricing associated with such excess coverage, to the extent available, will not continue to increase, nor that insurance coverage from third party insurers for excess coverage of commercial trucking claims will even be available on commercially reasonable terms at certain levels. Moreover, the occurrence of a Nuclear Verdict, or the settlement of a catastrophic injury and/or fatality claim that could have otherwise resulted in a Nuclear Verdict, could have a material adverse effect on Landstar’s cost of insurance and claims and its results of operations. 

The Company does not allow for the recognition of a gain contingency within its consolidated financial statements prior to the settlement of the underlying events or contingencies associated with the gain contingency. As a result, the consideration related to a gain contingency is recorded in the consolidated financial statements during the period in which all underlying events or contingencies are resolved and the gain is realized. 

Further, the Company retains liability of up to $2,000,000 for each general liability claim, $250,000 for each workers’ compensation claim and $250,000 for each cargo claim. In addition, under reinsurance arrangements by Signature of certain risks of the Company’s BCO Independent Contractors, the Company retains liability of up to $500,000, $1,000,000 or $2,000,000 with respect to certain occupational accident claims and up to $750,000 with respect to certain workers’ compensation claims. The Company’s exposure to liability associated with accidents incurred by Truck Brokerage Carriers, railroads and air and ocean cargo carriers who transport 

28 

Table of Contents

freight on behalf of the Company is reduced by various legal defenses and other factors including the extent to which such carriers maintain their own insurance coverage. A material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents, cargo claims or workers’ compensation claims or the material unfavorable development of existing claims could have a material adverse effect on Landstar’s cost of insurance and claims and its results of operations. 

Selling, general and administrative 

During the 2024 fiscal year, employee compensation and benefits accounted for approximately 62% of the Company’s selling, general and administrative costs. Employee compensation and benefits include wages and employee benefit costs as well as incentive compensation and stock-based compensation expense. Incentive compensation and stock-based compensation expense is highly variable in nature in comparison to wages and employee benefit costs. 

Depreciation and amortization 

Depreciation and amortization primarily relate to depreciation of trailing equipment and information technology hardware and software. 

Costs of revenue 

The Company incurs costs of revenue related to the transportation of freight and, to a much lesser extent, to reinsurance premiums received by Signature. Costs of revenue include variable costs of revenue and other costs of revenue. Variable costs of revenue include purchased transportation and commissions to agents, as these costs are entirely variable on a shipment-by-shipment basis. Other costs of revenue include fixed costs of revenue and semi-variable costs of revenue, where such costs may vary over time based on certain economic factors or operational metrics such as the number of Company-controlled trailers, the number of BCO Independent Contractors, the frequency and severity of insurance claims, the number of miles traveled by BCO Independent Contractors, or the number and/or scale of information technology projects in process or in-service to support revenue generating activities, rather than on a shipment-by-shipment basis. Other costs of revenue associated with the transportation of freight include: (i) other operating costs, primarily consisting of trailer maintenance, the provision for uncollectible advances and other receivables due from BCO Independent Contractors and independent commission sales agents and BCO Independent Contractor recruiting and qualification costs, as reported in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income, (ii) transportation-related insurance premiums paid and claim costs incurred, included as a portion of insurance and claims in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income, (iii) costs incurred related to internally developed software including ASC 350-40 amortization, implementation costs, hosting costs and other support costs utilized to support the Company’s independent commission sales agents, third party capacity providers, and customers, included as a portion of depreciation and amortization and of selling, general and administrative in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income; and (iv) depreciation on Company-owned trailing equipment, included as a portion of depreciation and amortization in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income. Other costs of revenue associated with reinsurance premiums received by Signature are comprised of broker commissions and other fees paid related to the administration of insurance programs to BCO Independent Contractors and are included in selling, general and administrative in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income. In addition to costs of revenue, the Company incurs various other costs relating to its business, including most selling, general and administrative costs and portions of costs attributable to insurance and claims and depreciation and amortization. Management continually monitors all components of the costs incurred by the Company and establishes annual cost budgets that, in general, are used to benchmark costs incurred on a monthly basis. 

Gross Profit, Variable Contribution, Gross Profit Margin and Variable Contribution Margin 

The following table sets forth calculations of gross profit, defined as revenue less costs of revenue, and gross profit margin, defined as gross profit divided by revenue, for the periods indicated. The Company refers to revenue less variable costs of revenue as “variable contribution” and variable contribution divided by revenue as “variable contribution margin”. Variable contribution and variable contribution margin are each non-GAAP financial measures. The closest comparable GAAP financial measures to variable contribution and variable contribution margin are, respectively, gross profit and gross profit margin. The Company believes variable contribution and variable contribution margin are useful measures of the variable costs that we incur at a shipment-by-shipment level attributable to our transportation network of third party capacity providers and independent commission sales agents in order to provide services to our customers. The Company believes variable contribution and variable contribution margin are important performance measurements and management considers variable contribution and variable contribution margin in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and in its decision-making, such as budgeting for infrastructure, trailing equipment and selling, general and administrative costs.

Insurance-related costs in the table above include (i) other costs of revenue related to the transportation of freight that are included as a portion of insurance and claims in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income and (ii) certain other costs of revenue related to reinsurance premiums received by Signature that are included as a portion of selling, general and administrative in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income. Insurance and claims costs included in other costs of revenue relating to the transportation of freight primarily consist of insurance premiums paid for commercial auto liability, general liability, cargo and other lines of coverage related to the transportation of freight and the related cost of claims incurred under those programs, and, to a lesser extent, the cost of claims incurred under insurance programs available to BCO Independent Contractors that are reinsured by Signature. Other insurance and claims costs included in costs of revenue that are included in selling, general and administrative in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income consist of brokerage commissions and other fees incurred by Signature relating to the administration of insurance programs available to BCO Independent Contractors that are reinsured by Signature. 

In general, variable contribution margin on revenue generated by BCO Independent Contractors represents a fixed percentage due to the nature of the contracts that pay a fixed percentage of revenue to both the BCO Independent Contractors and independent commission sales agents. For revenue generated by Truck Brokerage Carriers, variable contribution margin may be either a fixed or variable percentage, depending on the contract with each individual independent commission sales agent. Variable contribution margin on revenue generated from shipments hauled by railroads, air cargo carriers, ocean cargo carriers and Truck Brokerage Carriers, other than those under retention contracts, is variable in nature, as the Company’s contracts with independent commission sales agents provide commissions to agents at a contractually agreed upon percentage of the amount represented by revenue less purchased transportation for these types of shipments. Approximately 43% of the Company’s consolidated revenue in fiscal year 2024 was generated under transactions that pay a fixed percentage of revenue to the third party capacity provider and/or agents while 57% was generated under transactions that pay a variable percentage of revenue to the third party capacity provider and/or agents. 

Operating income as a percentage of gross profit and operating income as a percentage of variable contribution 

The following table presents operating income as a percentage of gross profit and operating income as a percentage of variable contribution. The Company’s operating income as a percentage of variable contribution is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as operating income divided by variable contribution. The Company believes that operating income as a percentage of variable contribution is useful and meaningful to investors for the following principal reasons: (i) the variable costs of revenue for a significant portion of the business are highly influenced by short-term market-based trends in the freight transportation industry, whereas other costs, including other costs of revenue, are much less impacted by short-term freight market trends; (ii) disclosure of this measure allows investors to better understand the underlying trends in the Company’s results of operations; (iii) this measure is meaningful to

investors’ evaluations of the Company’s management of costs attributable to operations other than the purely variable costs associated with purchased transportation and commissions to agents that the Company incurs to provide services to our customers; and (iv) management considers this financial information in its decision-making, such as budgeting for infrastructure, trailing equipment and selling, general and administrative costs.

The decrease in operating income as a percentage of gross profit from fiscal year 2023 to fiscal year 2024, as well as from fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year 2023, resulted from the decrease of operating income at a more rapid percentage rate than the decrease in gross profit, primarily due to the impact of the Company’s fixed cost infrastructure, principally certain components of selling, general and administrative costs, in comparison to a smaller gross profit base. 

The decrease in operating income as a percentage of variable contribution from fiscal year 2023 to fiscal year 2024 resulted from the decrease of operating income at a more rapid percentage rate than the decrease in variable contribution, primarily due to the impact of the Company’s fixed cost infrastructure, principally certain components of selling, general and administrative costs, in comparison to a smaller variable contribution base. The decrease in operating income as a percentage of variable contribution from fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year 2023 resulted from operating income decreasing at a more rapid percentage rate than the decrease in variable contribution, primarily due to the impact of the Company’s fixed cost infrastructure, principally certain components of selling, general and administrative costs, in comparison to a smaller variable contribution base, partially offset by the impact of decreased incentive and equity compensation costs under the Company’s variable compensation programs. 

Also, as previously mentioned, the Company reports two operating segments: the transportation logistics segment and the insurance segment. External revenue at the insurance segment, representing reinsurance premiums, has historically been relatively consistent on an annual basis at 2% or less of consolidated revenue and generally corresponds directly with the number of trucks provided by BCO Independent Contractors. The discussion of cost line items in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations considers the Company’s costs on a consolidated basis rather than on a segment basis. Management believes this presentation format is the most appropriate to assist users of the financial statements in understanding the Company’s business for the following reasons: (1) the insurance segment has no other operating costs; (2) discussion of insurance and claims at either segment without reference to the other may create confusion amongst investors and potential investors due to intercompany arrangements and specific deductible programs that affect comparability of financial results by segment between various fiscal periods but that have no effect on the Company from a consolidated reporting perspective; (3) selling, general and administrative costs of the insurance segment comprise less than 10% of consolidated selling, general and administrative costs and have historically been relatively consistent on a year-over-year basis; and (4) the insurance segment has no depreciation and amortization. 

Fiscal Year Ended December 28, 2024 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 30, 2023 

Revenue for fiscal year 2024 was $4,819,245,000, a decrease of $484,077,000, or 9%, compared to fiscal year 2023. Transportation revenue decreased $474,838,000, or 9%. The decrease in transportation revenue was attributable to a decreased number of loads hauled of approximately 8% and decreased revenue per load of approximately 1% compared to fiscal year 2023. Reinsurance premiums were $63,237,000 and $72,476,000 for fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in revenue from reinsurance premiums was primarily attributable to a decrease in the average number of trucks provided by BCO Independent Contractors in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023.

Truck transportation revenue generated by BCO Independent Contractors and Truck Brokerage Carriers (together, the “third party truck capacity providers”) for fiscal year 2024 was $4,346,554,000, representing 90% of total revenue, a decrease of $482,976,000, or 10%, compared to fiscal year 2023. The number of loads hauled by third party truck capacity providers decreased approximately 8% in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023, and revenue per load on loads hauled by third party truck capacity providers decreased approximately 2% compared to fiscal year 2023. 

The decrease in the number of loads hauled via truck compared to fiscal year 2023 was primarily due to a broad-based decrease in demand for the Company’s truck transportation services. Loads hauled via other truck transportation services decreased 20%, less-than-truckload loadings decreased 13%, loads hauled via van equipment decreased 7% and loads hauled via unsided/platform equipment decreased 6% as compared to fiscal year 2023. 

The decrease in revenue per load on loads hauled via truck was primarily due to a softer freight demand environment experienced during fiscal year 2024 and the impact of lower diesel fuel costs on loads hauled via Truck Brokerage Carriers. Revenue per load on loads hauled via other truck transportation services decreased 10%, on loads hauled via van equipment decreased 4% and on less-than-truckload loadings decreased 3%, while revenue per load on loads hauled via unsided/platform equipment increased 3% as compared to fiscal year 2023. The increase in revenue per load on loads hauled via unsided/platform equipment of 3% was favorably impacted by an increase in the percentage of revenue contributed by heavy/specialized equipment, which typically has a higher revenue per load. 

Fuel surcharges billed to customers on revenue generated by BCO Independent Contractors are excluded from revenue. Fuel surcharges on Truck Brokerage Carrier revenue identified separately in billings to customers and included as a component of Truck Brokerage Carrier revenue were $118,295,000 and $147,691,000 in fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. It should be noted that billings to many customers of the Company’s truck brokerage services include a single all-in rate and do not separately identify fuel surcharges on loads hauled via Truck Brokerage Carriers. Accordingly, the overall impact of changes in fuel prices on revenue and revenue per load on loads hauled via truck is likely to be greater than that indicated. 

Transportation revenue generated by rail intermodal, air cargo and ocean cargo carriers (collectively, the “multimode capacity providers”) for fiscal year 2024 was $374,230,000, or 8% of total revenue, an increase of $9,295,000, or 3%, compared to fiscal year 2023. Revenue per load on revenue generated by multimode capacity providers increased approximately 3% in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023, while the number of loads hauled by multimode capacity providers was approximately the same in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023. Revenue per load on loads hauled via ocean increased 15%, while revenue per load on loads hauled via air and rail intermodal decreased 51% and 9%, respectively, during fiscal year 2024 as compared to fiscal year 2023. The increase in revenue per load on loads hauled by ocean was broad-based across many customers and reflected the impact of various geopolitical events on ocean shipping rates, generally. The decrease in revenue per load on loads hauled by air cargo carriers was primarily attributable to the impact of high value air loadings at one specific customer during fiscal year 2023. The decrease in revenue per load on loads hauled by rail intermodal was broad-based across many customers. Revenue per load on revenue generated by multimode capacity providers is influenced by many factors, including revenue mix among the various modes of transportation used, length of haul, complexity of freight, density of freight lanes, fuel costs and availability of capacity. 

Purchased transportation was 77.7% and 76.7% of revenue in fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to an increased rate of purchased transportation on revenue generated by Truck Brokerage Carriers. Commissions to agents were 8.1% and 8.7% of revenue in fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in commissions to agents as a percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to an increased cost of purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue on revenue generated by Truck Brokerage Carriers during fiscal year 2024. 

Investment income was $14,810,000 and $10,141,000 in fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in investment income was attributable to a higher average investment balance held by the insurance segment during fiscal year 2024 and higher average rates of return on investments in fiscal year 2024. 

Other operating costs increased $4,590,000 in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023. The increase in other operating costs compared to the prior year was primarily due to an increased provision for contractor bad debt and decreased gains on sales of operating property. 

Insurance and claims decreased $312,000 in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023. The decrease in insurance and claims expense compared to the prior year was primarily due to decreased BCO miles traveled during fiscal year 2024, partially offset by increased net unfavorable development of prior years’ claims in fiscal year 2024. During the 2024 and 2023 fiscal years, insurance and claims costs included $8,824,000 and $6,058,000 of net unfavorable adjustments to prior years’ claims estimates, respectively.

Selling, general and administrative costs increased $5,909,000 in fiscal year 2024 as compared to fiscal year 2023. The increase in selling, general and administrative costs compared to prior year was primarily attributable to increased employee benefit costs, primarily attributable to increased medical and pharmacy costs under the self-insured portion of the Company’s medical plan, the impact of Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) transition costs and an increased provision for incentive compensation, partially offset by decreased project consulting fees. Included in selling, general and administrative costs was incentive compensation expense of $1,970,000 and $591,000 for the 2024 and 2023 fiscal years, respectively. 

Depreciation and amortization decreased $1,415,000 in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to decreased trailing equipment depreciation, partially offset by increased depreciation on new and updated digital tools deployed for use by the Company’s network of agents, capacity providers and employees. 

Net interest and debt income increased $1,473,000 in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023. The increase in interest and debt income was primarily attributable to increased interest income earned on cash balances held by the transportation logistics segment, partially offset by increased interest expense related to finance lease obligations. 

The effective income tax rate was 23.0% for fiscal year 2024 and 24.0% for fiscal year 2023. The effective income tax rate was higher than the statutory federal income tax rate of 21% for fiscal year 2024 primarily attributable to state taxes, partially offset by federal research and development tax credits. The effective income tax rate was higher than the statutory federal income tax rate of 21% in fiscal year 2023 primarily attributable to state income taxes and nondeductible executive compensation, partially offset by excess tax benefits realized on stock-based awards. 

Net income was $195,946,000, or $5.51 per basic and diluted share, in fiscal year 2024. Net income was $264,394,000, or $7.36 per basic and diluted share, in fiscal year 2023. 

Fiscal Year Ended December 30, 2023 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2022 

Revenue for fiscal year 2023 was $5,303,322,000, a decrease of $2,133,240,000, or 29%, compared to fiscal year 2022. Transportation revenue decreased $2,127,162,000, or 29%. During the Company’s 2023 fiscal year, freight demand was soft throughout the year and culminated with an unusually weak peak season in the 2023 fourth quarter. The decrease in transportation revenue was attributable to a decreased number of loads hauled of approximately 17% and decreased revenue per load of approximately 15% compared to fiscal year 2022. Reinsurance premiums were $72,476,000 and $78,554,000 for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in revenue from reinsurance premiums was primarily attributable to a decrease in the average number of trucks provided by BCO Independent Contractors in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022, partially offset by an increase in the aggregate value of equipment insured by BCO Independent Contractors under a physical damage program reinsured by Signature in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022. The Company’s fiscal year ends each year on the last Saturday in December and, as such, the Company’s fiscal year 2023 included fifty-two weeks of operations whereas fiscal year 2022 included fifty-three weeks of operations. 

Truck transportation revenue generated by third party truck capacity providers for fiscal year 2023 was $4,829,530,000, representing 91% of total revenue, a decrease of $1,801,309,000, or 27%, compared to fiscal year 2022. The number of loads hauled by third party truck capacity providers decreased approximately 17% in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022, and revenue per load on loads hauled by third party truck capacity providers decreased approximately 13% compared to fiscal year 2022. 

The decrease in the number of loads hauled via truck compared to fiscal year 2022 was primarily due to a decrease in demand from the record high levels experienced in fiscal year 2022 for the Company’s van services and power-only services included in other truck transportations services, which tend to be more correlated with U.S. consumer demand. Loads hauled via other truck transportation services decreased 37%, loads hauled via van equipment decreased 16%, loads hauled via unsided/platform equipment decreased 10% and less-than-truckload loadings decreased 8% as compared to fiscal year 2022. 

The decrease in revenue per load on loads hauled via truck was primarily due to pricing pressure throughout fiscal year 2023 as industry-wide truck capacity was significantly more readily available as compared to fiscal year 2022, particularly during the 2022 first quarter during which pandemic-related supply chain disruption was at a high point, partially offset by an increased average length

of haul during fiscal year 2023. Revenue per load on loads hauled via van equipment decreased 16%, on less-than-truckload loadings decreased 10%, on loads hauled by other truck transportation services decreased 9% and on loads hauled via unsided/platform equipment decreased 6% as compared to fiscal year 2022. 

Fuel surcharges billed to customers on revenue generated by BCO Independent Contractors are excluded from revenue. Fuel surcharges on Truck Brokerage Carrier revenue identified separately in billings to customers and included as a component of Truck Brokerage Carrier revenue were $147,691,000 and $211,770,000 in fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. It should be noted that billings to many customers of the Company’s truck brokerage services include a single all-in rate and do not separately identify fuel surcharges on loads hauled via Truck Brokerage Carriers. Accordingly, the overall impact of changes in fuel prices on revenue and revenue per load on loads hauled via truck is likely to be greater than that indicated. 

Transportation revenue generated by multimode capacity providers for fiscal year 2023 was $364,935,000, or 7% of total revenue, a decrease of $339,068,000, or 48%, compared to fiscal year 2022. Revenue per load on revenue generated by multimode capacity providers decreased approximately 31% in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022, and the number of loads hauled by multimode capacity providers decreased approximately 24% over the same period. Revenue per load on loads hauled via ocean, air and rail intermodal decreased 40%, 35% and 7%, respectively, during fiscal year 2023 as compared to fiscal year 2022. The decrease in revenue per load on loads hauled by ocean and air cargo carriers was primarily related to the impact of global supply chain disruptions during the 2022 fiscal year, which were particularly acute with respect to international ocean and air freight. Revenue per load on revenue generated by multimode capacity providers is influenced by many factors, including revenue mix among the various modes of transportation used, length of haul, complexity of freight, density of freight lanes, fuel costs and availability of capacity. The decrease in the number of loads hauled by multimode capacity providers was due to a 27% decrease in rail loadings, a 23% decrease in ocean loadings and a 19% decrease in air loadings. The 27% decrease in rail loadings and the 23% decrease in ocean loadings were both broad-based with particularly significant declines at a limited number of specific customers, while the 19% decrease in air loadings was primarily attributable to decreased loadings at one specific customer. 

Purchased transportation was 76.7% and 78.0% of revenue in fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to (i) a decreased rate of purchased transportation on revenue generated by Truck Brokerage Carriers and (ii) a decreased percentage of revenue generated by multimode capacity providers, which typically has a higher rate of purchased transportation than third party truck capacity providers. Commissions to agents were 8.7% and 8.3% of revenue in fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in commissions to agents as a percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to a decreased cost of purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue on revenue generated by Truck Brokerage Carriers during fiscal year 2023. 

Investment income was $10,141,000 and $3,162,000 in fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in investment income was attributable to higher average rates of return on investments and a higher average investment balance held by the insurance segment during fiscal year 2023. 

Other operating costs increased $8,999,000 in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022. The increase in other operating costs compared to the prior year was primarily due to (i) increased trailing equipment maintenance costs as a result of the higher average age of the Company-owned trailer fleet and increased labor and parts costs charged by the Company’s network of third party trailer maintenance facilities and (ii) an increased provision for contractor bad debt, partially offset by increased gains on sales of operating property. 

Insurance and claims decreased $11,594,000 in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022. The decrease in insurance and claims expense compared to the prior year was primarily due to decreased severity of current year trucking claims during fiscal year 2023, decreased net unfavorable development of prior years’ claims in fiscal year 2023 and a decrease in BCO miles traveled in the 2023 fiscal year, partially offset by increased insurance premiums, primarily for commercial auto and excess liability coverage. During the 2023 and 2022 fiscal years, insurance and claims costs included $6,058,000 and $11,331,000 of net unfavorable adjustments to prior years’ claims estimates, respectively. 

Selling, general and administrative costs decreased $9,480,000 in fiscal year 2023 as compared to fiscal year 2022. The decrease in selling, general and administrative costs compared to prior year was primarily attributable to a decreased provision for incentive compensation, decreased stock-based compensation expense and a decreased provision for customer bad debt, partially offset by increased information technology costs and increased wages. Included in selling, general and administrative costs was incentive compensation expense of $591,000 and $16,507,000 for the 2023 and 2022 fiscal years, respectively, and stock-based compensation expense of $4,282,000 and $12,399,000 for the 2023 and 2022 fiscal years, respectively.

Table of Contents

Depreciation and amortization increased $700,000 in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to increased depreciation on new and updated digital tools deployed for use by the Company’s network of agents, capacity providers and employees, partially offset by decreased trailing equipment depreciation. 

The year-over-prior-year change in interest and debt (income) expense was $7,566,000, with net interest and debt income of $3,946,000 in fiscal year 2023 compared to net interest and debt expense of $3,620,000 in fiscal year 2022. The increase in interest and debt (income) expense was primarily attributable to increased interest income earned on cash balances held by the transportation logistics segment, decreased interest expense related to finance lease obligations and decreased average borrowings on the Company’s revolving credit facility, as the Company had no borrowings during the 2023 fiscal year. 

The effective income tax rate was 24.0% for fiscal year 2023 and 24.1% for fiscal year 2022. The effective income tax rates for both fiscal years 2023 and 2022 were higher than the statutory federal income tax rate of 21% primarily attributable to state income taxes and nondeductible executive compensation, partially offset by excess tax benefits realized on stock-based awards. 

Net income was $264,394,000, or $7.36 per basic and diluted share, in fiscal year 2023. Net income was $430,914,000, or $11.76 per basic and diluted share, in fiscal year 2022. 

Capital Resources and Liquidity 

Working capital and the ratio of current assets to current liabilities were $646,713,000 and 2.0 to 1, respectively, at December 28, 2024, compared with $677,517,000 and 2.0 to 1, respectively, at December 30, 2023, and $561,255,000 and 1.6 to 1, respectively, at December 31, 2022. Landstar has historically operated with current ratios within the range of 1.5 to 1 to 2.0 to 1. Cash provided by operating activities was $286,561,000, $393,648,000, and $622,659,000 in fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in cash flow provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2024 was primarily attributable to decreased net income and decreased favorable net working capital impacts in connection with decreased net receivables, defined as accounts receivable less accounts payable. The decrease in cash flow provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2023 was primarily attributable to decreased net income and decreased favorable net working capital impacts in connection with the timing of collections of receivables and payment of certain payables as compared to the 2022 fiscal year. 

The Company declared and paid $1.38 per share, or $49,043,000 in the aggregate, in cash dividends during fiscal year 2024, and during such period, also paid $71,433,000 of dividends payable which were declared during fiscal year 2023 and included in current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 30, 2023. In addition, on December 9, 2024, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $2.00 per share, or $70,632,000 in the aggregate, payable on January 21, 2025 to stockholders of record of its Common Stock as of January 7, 2025. Dividends payable of $70,632,000 related to this special dividend were included in current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 28, 2024. The Company declared and paid $1.26 per share, or $45,276,000 in the aggregate, in cash dividends during fiscal year 2023, and during such period, also paid $71,854,000 of dividends payable which were declared during fiscal year 2022 and included in current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2022. The Company declared and paid $1.10 per share, or $40,284,000 in the aggregate, in cash dividends during fiscal year 2022 and, during such period, also paid $75,387,000 of dividends payable which were declared during fiscal year 2021 and included in current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 25, 2021. Since paying its first cash dividend in August 2005, the Company has paid approximately $965,000,000 in cash dividends in the aggregate to its stockholders, inclusive of the $2.00 per share special dividend paid on January 21, 2025. 

During fiscal year 2024, the Company purchased 452,019 shares of its Common Stock at a total cost of $82,117,000, including $81,400,000 in cash purchases and accrued excise tax of $717,000 which is included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 28, 2024. During fiscal year 2023, the Company purchased 319,332 shares of its Common Stock at a total cost of $54,267,000, including $53,919,000 in cash purchases and excise tax of $348,000 which was included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 30, 2023 and paid during fiscal year 2024. During fiscal year 2022, the Company purchased 1,900,826 shares of its Common Stock at a total cost of $285,983,000. The Company has used cash provided by operating activities to fund the purchases. Since January 1997, the Company has purchased approximately $2,335,000,000 of its Common Stock under programs authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company in open market and private block transactions. As of December 28, 2024, the Company may purchase in the aggregate up to 2,547,981 shares of its Common Stock under its authorized stock purchase programs. Long-term debt, including current maturities, was $102,307,000 at December 28, 2024, compared to $71,140,000 at December 30, 2023 and $103,400,000 at December 31, 2022.

Shareholders’ equity was $972,439,000, or 90% of total capitalization (defined as long-term debt including current maturities plus equity), at December 28, 2024, compared to $983,923,000, or 93% of total capitalization at December 30, 2023 and $887,221,000, or 90% of total capitalization at December 31, 2022. The decrease in shareholders’ equity was primarily the result of dividends declared by the Company and purchases of shares of the Company’s Common Stock in fiscal year 2024, partially offset by net income. The increase in shareholders’ equity in fiscal year 2023 was primarily the result of net income, partially offset by dividends declared by the Company and purchases of shares of the Company’s Common Stock in fiscal year 2023. 

On July 1, 2022, Landstar entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement with a bank syndicate led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (as further amended as of June 21, 2024, the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement, which matures July 1, 2027, provides for borrowing capacity in the form of a revolving credit facility of $300,000,000, $45,000,000 of which may be utilized in the form of letters of credit. The Credit Agreement also includes an “accordion” feature providing for a possible increase of up to an aggregate amount of borrowing capacity of $600,000,000. 

The Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants that limit, among other things, the incurrence of additional indebtedness. The Company is required to, among other things, maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, as described in the Credit Agreement, and maintain a Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, below a specified maximum. The Credit Agreement provides for a restriction on cash dividends and other distributions to stockholders on the Company’s capital stock to the extent there is a default under the Credit Agreement. In addition, the Credit Agreement under certain circumstances limits the amount of such cash dividends and other distributions to stockholders to the extent that, after giving effect to any payment made to effect such cash dividend or other distribution, the Leverage Ratio would exceed 2.5 to 1 on a pro forma basis as of the end of the Company’s most recently completed fiscal quarter. The Credit Agreement provides for an event of default in the event that, among other things, a person or group acquires 35% or more of the outstanding capital stock of the Company or obtains power to elect a majority of the Company’s directors or the directors cease to consist of a majority of Continuing Directors, as defined in the Credit Agreement. None of these covenants are presently considered by the Company to be materially restrictive to the Company’s operations, capital resources or liquidity. The Company is currently in compliance with all of the debt covenants under the Credit Agreement. 

At December 28, 2024, the Company had no borrowings outstanding and $35,250,000 of letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement. At December 28, 2024, there was $264,750,000 available for future borrowings under the Credit Agreement and access to an additional $300,000,000 under the Credit Agreement’s “accordion” feature. In addition, the Company has $74,321,000 in letters of credit outstanding as collateral for insurance claims that are secured by investments totaling $82,579,000 at December 28, 2024. Investments, all of which are carried at fair value, include primarily investment-grade bonds, asset-backed securities and commercial paper having maturities of up to five years. Fair value of investments is based primarily on quoted market prices. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included herein for further discussion on measurement of fair value of investments. 

Historically, the Company has generated sufficient operating cash flow to meet its debt service requirements, fund continued growth, both organic and through acquisitions, complete or execute share purchases of its Common Stock under authorized share purchase programs, pay dividends and meet working capital needs. As an asset-light provider of integrated transportation management solutions, the Company’s annual capital requirements for operating property are generally for trailing equipment and information technology hardware and software. In addition, a significant portion of the trailing equipment used by the Company is provided by third party capacity providers, thereby reducing the Company’s capital requirements. During fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company acquired $62,194,000, $4,093,000 and $30,659,000, respectively, of trailing equipment by entering into finance leases. During fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company also purchased $30,998,000, $25,688,000 and $26,005,000, respectively, of operating property. Landstar anticipates acquiring either by purchase or lease financing approximately $16,000,000 in new trailing equipment, primarily to replace older trailing equipment in fiscal year 2025. Landstar anticipates spending approximately $14,000,000 on information technology hardware and software in fiscal year 2025, $12,000,000 of which relates to either building or buying software applications that enhance or add to the Company’s technology ecosystem. In addition, Landstar anticipates spending approximately $4,000,000 on buildings and improvements in fiscal year 2025. 

On April 1, 2022, Landstar Investment Holdco, LLC, a newly formed Delaware LLC and wholly owned subsidiary of Landstar System Holdings, Inc., purchased Class A units of Cavnue, LLC for approximately $4,999,000 in cash consideration. Cavnue, LLC is a privately held company focused on combining technology and road infrastructure to unlock the full potential of connected and autonomous vehicles. 

Management believes that cash flow from operations combined with the Company’s borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement will be adequate to meet Landstar’s debt service requirements, fund continued growth, both internal and through acquisitions, pay dividends, complete the authorized share purchase programs and meet working capital needs.

Legal Proceedings 

The Company is involved in certain claims and pending litigation arising from the normal conduct of business. Many of these claims are covered in whole or in part by insurance. Based on knowledge of the facts and, in certain cases, opinions of outside counsel, management believes that adequate provisions have been made for probable and reasonably estimable losses with respect to the resolution of all such claims and pending litigation and that the ultimate outcome, after provisions therefor, will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company, but could have a material effect on the results of operations in a given quarter or year. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Landstar provides for the estimated costs of self-insured claims primarily on an actuarial basis. The amount recorded for the estimated liability for claims incurred is based upon the facts and circumstances known on the applicable balance sheet date. The ultimate resolution of these claims may be for an amount greater or less than the amount estimated by the Company. The Company continually revises its existing claim estimates as new or revised information becomes available on the status of each claim. Historically, the Company has experienced both favorable and unfavorable development of prior years’ claims estimates within its various programs. During fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, insurance and claims costs included $8,824,000, $6,058,000 and $11,331,000 of net unfavorable adjustments to prior years’ claims estimates, respectively. The unfavorable development of prior years’ claims in the 2024, 2023 and 2022 fiscal years was attributable in each year to several specific claims. It is reasonably likely that the ultimate outcome of settling all outstanding claims will be more or less than the estimated claims liability at December 28, 2024, primarily due to the inherent difficulty in estimating the severity of commercial trucking claims and the potential judgment or settlement amount that may be incurred in connection with the resolution of such claims. 

Significant variances from the Company’s estimates for the ultimate resolution of self-insured claims could be expected to positively or negatively affect Landstar’s earnings in a given quarter or year. However, management believes that the ultimate resolution of these items, given a range of reasonably likely outcomes, will not significantly affect the long-term financial condition of Landstar or its ability to fund its continuing operations. 

Item 7A.
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

The Company is exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of its financing activities, primarily its borrowings on its revolving credit facility, if any, and investing activities with respect to investments held by the insurance segment. 

On July 1, 2022, Landstar entered into the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as further amended as of June 21, 2024, the “Credit Agreement”) with a bank syndicate led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent. The Credit Agreement, which matures July 1, 2027, provides for borrowing capacity in the form of a revolving credit facility of $300,000,000, $45,000,000 of which may be utilized in the form of letters of credit. The Credit Agreement also includes an “accordion” feature providing for a possible increase of up to an aggregate amount of borrowing capacity of $600,000,000. 

The revolving credit loans under the Credit Agreement as of December 28, 2024, at the option of Landstar, bear interest at (i) a forward-looking term rate based on the secured overnight financing rate plus 0.10% and an applicable margin ranging from 1.25% to 2.00%, or (ii) an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.25% to 1.00%, in each case with the applicable margin determined based upon the Company’s Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, at the end of the most recent applicable fiscal quarter for which financial statements have been delivered. The revolving credit facility bears a commitment fee, payable in arrears, of 0.20% to 0.30%, based on the Company’s Leverage Ratio at the end of the most recent applicable fiscal quarter for which financial statements have been delivered. During all of fiscal years 2024 and 2023 and as of both December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement. 

Long-term investments, all of which are available-for-sale and are carried at fair value, include primarily investment-grade bonds and asset-backed securities having maturities of up to five years. Assuming that the long-term portion of investments remains at $92,246,000, the balance at December 28, 2024, a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points would not have a material impact on future earnings on an annualized basis. Short-term investments consist of short-term investment-grade instruments and the current maturities of investment-grade corporate bonds and asset-backed securities. Accordingly, any future interest rate risk on these short-term investments would not be material to the Company’s operating results.

Table of Contents

Assets and liabilities of the Company’s Canadian and Mexican operations are translated from their functional currency to U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and revenue and expense accounts are translated at average monthly exchange rates during the period. Adjustments resulting from the translation process are included in accumulated other comprehensive income. Transactional gains and losses arising from receivable and payable balances, including intercompany balances, in the normal course of business that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the operation are recorded in the statements of income when they occur. The assets held at the Company’s Canadian and Mexican subsidiaries at December 28, 2024 were collectively, as translated to U.S. dollars, approximately 4% of total consolidated assets. Accordingly, translation gains or losses of 15% or less related to the Canadian and Mexican operations would not be material.

LANDSTAR SYSTEM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(1) Significant Accounting Policies 

Consolidation 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Landstar System, Inc. and its subsidiary, Landstar System Holdings, Inc. (“LSHI”). Landstar System, Inc. and its subsidiary are herein referred to as “Landstar” or the “Company.” Significant intercompany accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Estimates 

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the use of management’s estimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Fiscal Year 

Landstar’s fiscal year is the 52 or 53 week period ending the last Saturday in December. 

Revenue Recognition 

The nature of the Company’s freight transportation services and its performance obligations to customers, regardless of the mode of transportation used to perform such services, relate to the safe and 
on-time

pick-up
 and delivery of a customer’s freight on a 
shipment-by-shipment
 basis. Landstar customers are typically invoiced on a 
shipment-by-shipment
 basis at a 
pre-defined
 rate, payable thirty to sixty 
(30-60)
 days after the customer’s receipt of such invoice. Payment terms to customers do not contain a significant financing component and the amount owed by the customer does not contain variable terms, embedded or otherwise. We have determined that revenue recognition over the freight transit period provides a faithful depiction of the transfer of services to the customer as our obligation for which we are primarily responsible for fulfilling is performed over the transit period. Accordingly, transportation revenue billed to a customer for the physical transportation of freight and related direct freight expenses are recognized on a gross basis over the freight transit period as the performance obligation to the customer is satisfied. The Company determines the transit period for a given shipment based upon the 
pick-up
 date and the delivery date, which may be estimated if delivery has not occurred as of the reporting date. Determining the transit period and how much of it has been completed as of a given reporting date may therefore require management to make judgments that affect the timing of revenue recognized. With respect to shipments with a 
pick-up
 date in one reporting period and a delivery date in another, the Company recognizes such transportation revenue based on relative transit time in each reporting period. A days in transit output method is used to measure the progress of the performance of the Company’s freight transportation services as of the reporting date and a portion of the total revenue that will be billed to the customer once a load is delivered is recognized in each reporting period based on the percentage of total transit time that has been completed at the end of the applicable reporting period. Reinsurance premiums of the insurance segment are recognized over the period earned, which is usually on a monthly basis. Fuel surcharges billed to customers for freight hauled by independent contractors who provide truck capacity to the Company under exclusive lease arrangements (the “BCO Independent Contractors”) are excluded from revenue and paid in entirety to the BCO Independent Contractors.

Includes power-only, expedited, straight truck, cargo van, and miscellaneous other truck transportation revenue generated by the transportation logistics segment. Power-only refers to shipments where the Company furnishes a power unit and an operator but not trailing equipment, which is typically provided by the shipper or consignee. 

Insurance Claim Costs 

Landstar provides, primarily on an actuarially determined basis, for the estimated costs of cargo, property, casualty, general liability and workers’ compensation claims both reported and for claims incurred but not reported. 

Landstar retains liability through a self-insured retention for commercial trucking claims up to $
5
 million per occurrence. Effective May 1, 2023, the Company entered into a three year commercial auto liability insurance arrangement for losses incurred between $
5
 million and $
10
 million (the “2023 Initial Excess Policy”) with a third party insurance company. For commercial trucking claims incurred on or after May 1, 2023 through April 30, 2026, the 2023 Initial Excess Policy provides for an aggregate deductible of $
18
 million over the 
thirty-six-month
 term ending April 30, 2026. After payment of the deductible, the 2023 Initial Excess Policy provides for a limit for a single loss of $
5
 million, with an aggregate limit of $
15
 million for the 
thirty-six-month
 term ending April 30, 2026. 

The Company also maintains third party insurance arrangements providing excess coverage for commercial trucking liabilities in excess
 of
 $
10

million. These third party arrangements provide coverage on a per occurrence or aggregated basis. The Company from year to year manages the level of its financial exposure to commercial trucking claims in excess of $
10
 million, including through the use of additional self-insurance, deductibles, aggregate loss limits, quota shares and other arrangements with third party insurance companies, based on the availability of coverage within certain excess insurance coverage layers and estimated cost differentials between proposed premiums from third party insurance companies and historical and actuarially projected losses experienced by the Company at various levels of excess insurance coverage. 

Further, the Company retains liability of up to $
2,000,000
 for each general liability claim, $
250,000
 for each workers’ compensation claim and $
250,000
 for each cargo claim. In addition, under reinsurance arrangements by Signature Insurance Company (“Signature”) of certain risks of the Company’s BCO Independent Contractors, the Company retains liability of up to $
500,000
, $
1,000,000
 or $
2,000,000
 with respect to certain occupational accident claims and up to $
750,000
 with respect to certain workers’ compensation claims.

Tires 

Tires purchased as part of trailing equipment are capitalized as part of the cost of the equipment. Replacement tires are charged to expense when placed in service. 

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash 

Included in cash and cash equivalents are all investments, except those provided for collateral, with an original maturity of 3 months or less. At December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had 
no
 restricted cash held by the Company’s insurance segment. At December 25, 2021, the Company had $
4,049
,000 of restricted cash held by the Company’s insurance segment included in the short-term investments balance of $
35,778
,000, providing collateral, along with certain other investments, for the letters of credit issued to guarantee payment of insurance claims. 

Financial Instruments 

The Company’s financial instruments include cash equivalents, short and long-term investments, trade and other accounts receivable, accounts payable, other accrued liabilities, and long-term debt plus current maturities (“Debt”). The carrying value of cash equivalents, trade and other accounts receivable, accounts payable, current insurance claims and other accrued liabilities approximates fair value as the assets and liabilities are short term in nature. Short and long-term investments are carried at fair value as further described in Note 3 in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The Company’s Debt includes borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit facility, to the extent there are any, plus borrowings relating to finance lease obligations used to finance trailing equipment. The interest rates on borrowings under the revolving credit facility are typically tied to short-term interest rates that adjust monthly and, as such, carrying value approximates fair value. Interest rates on borrowings under finance leases approximate the interest rates that would currently be available to the Company under similar terms and, as such, carrying value approximates fair value. 

Trade and Other Receivables 

The allowance for doubtful accounts for both trade and other receivables represents management’s estimate of the amount of outstanding receivables that will not be collected. Estimates are used to determine the allowance for doubtful accounts for both trade and other receivables and are generally based on specific identification, historical collection results, current economic trends and changes in payment trends. 
Following is a summary of the activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts for fiscal years ending December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 (in thousands):

Other Receivables and Other Assets 

The Company provides financing to certain independent commission sales agents. Generally, these notes receivable include personal guarantees, may be collateralized by the assets and equity of the borrower and are due in periodic installments, including principal and interest payments, for terms of one to seven years. Notes receivable are recorded at amortized cost, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts. At December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the Company had $
26,606
,000 and $
5,079
,000, respectively, of gross notes receivable from independent commission sales agents. The current portion is included within other receivables and the long-term portion is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.

Operating Property 

Operating property is recorded at cost. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Buildings and improvements are being depreciated over 
30
 years. Trailing equipment is being depreciated over 
7
 to 
10
 years. Information technology hardware and software is generally being depreciated over 
3
 to 
7
 years. 

Goodwill 

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses. The Company has 
two
 reporting units within the transportation logistics segment that report goodwill. The Company reviews its goodwill balance annually for impairment for each reporting unit, unless circumstances dictate more frequent assessments, and in accordance with ASU 
2011-08,

Testing Goodwill for Impairment
. ASU 
2011-08
 permits an initial assessment, commonly referred to as “step zero”, of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and also provides a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative analysis required by ASC Topic 350. In the fourth fiscal quarter of 2024, the Company performed the qualitative assessment of goodwill and determined it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of its reporting units would be greater than its carrying amount. Therefore, the Company determined it was not necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. Furthermore, there has been no historical impairment of the Company’s goodwill. 

Income Taxes 

Income tax expense is equal to the current year’s liability for income taxes and a provision for deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the future tax effects attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. 

Share-Based Payments 

The Company’s share-based payment arrangements include restricted stock units (“RSU”), 
non-vested
 restricted stock, Deferred Stock Units and stock options. The fair value of an RSU with a performance condition is determined based on the market value of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of grant, discounted for lack of marketability for a minimum post-vesting holding requirement. With respect to RSU awards with a performance condition, the Company reports compensation expense ratably over the life of the award based on an estimated number of units that will vest over the life of the award, multiplied by the fair value of an RSU. The fair value of an RSU with a market condition is determined at the time of grant based on the expected achievement of the market condition at the end of each vesting period. With respect to RSU awards with a market condition, the Company recognizes compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period under an award based on the fair market value of the award at the time of grant, regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied. Previously recognized compensation cost would be reversed, however, if the employee terminated employment prior to completing such requisite service period. The Company estimates the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model and recognizes compensation cost for stock option awards expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. Forfeitures are estimated at grant date based on historical experience and anticipated employee turnover. The fair values of each share of 
non-vested
 restricted stock issued and Deferred Stock Unit granted are based on the fair value of a share of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of grant and compensation costs for 
non-vested
 restricted stock and Deferred Stock Units are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the award. 

Earnings Per Share 

Basic earnings per common share are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, which includes outstanding non-vested restricted stock and outstanding Deferred Stock Units. Diluted earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the incremental shares that would have been outstanding upon the assumed exercise of all dilutive stock options. During the fiscal years ended December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding is the same for purposes of the calculations of both basic and diluted earnings per share. During and as of the fiscal year ended December 28, 2024, there were no outstanding stock options issued by the

Table of Contents

Company. During the fiscal years ended December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the impact on earnings per share of future compensation expense related to outstanding, unvested time-based awards was greater than the incremental impact of outstanding dilutive stock options, and would therefore have an anti-dilutive effect on earnings per share if included in the calculation of earnings per share. Accordingly, the Company had

no
 reconciling items between the average number of common shares outstanding used to calculate basic earnings per common share and the average number of 

common shares and common share equivalents outstanding used to calculate diluted earnings per share during the fiscal years ended December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 

For the fiscal years ended December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, 
no
 options outstanding to purchase shares of Common Stock were antidilutive. Outstanding RSUs were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for all periods because the performance metric requirements or market condition for vesting had not been satisfied. 

Dividends Payable 

On 
December 9, 2024
, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $
2.00
 per share payable on 
January 21, 2025
 to stockholders of record of its Common Stock as of 
January 7, 2025
. Dividends payable of $
70,632
,000 related to this special dividend were included in current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 28, 2024. 

On 
December 4, 2023
, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $
2.00
 per share payable on 
January 19, 2024
 to stockholders of record of its Common Stock as of 
January 3, 2024
. Dividends payable of $
71,433
,000 related to this special dividend were included in current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 30, 2023. 

Foreign Currency Translation 

Assets and liabilities of the Company’s Canadian and Mexican operations are translated from their functional currency to U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and revenue and expense accounts are translated at average monthly exchange rates during the period. Adjustments resulting from the translation process are included in accumulated other comprehensive income. Transactional gains and losses arising from receivable and payable balances, including intercompany balances, in the normal course of business that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the operation are recorded in the statements of income when they occur. 

(2) Other Comprehensive Income 

The following table presents the components of and changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of related income taxes, as of and for the fiscal years ended December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 (in thousands):

(3) Investments 

Investments include primarily investment-grade corporate bonds, asset-backed securities and commercial paper having maturities of up to 
five years
 (the “bond portfolio”) and money market investments. Investments in the bond portfolio are reported as 
available-for-sale
 and are carried at fair value. Investments maturing less than one year from the balance sheet date are included in short-term investments and investments maturing more than one year from the balance sheet date are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Management performs an analysis of the nature of the unrealized losses on 
available-for-sale
 investments to determine whether an allowance for credit loss is necessary. Unrealized losses, representing the excess of the purchase price of an investment over its fair value as of the end of a period, considered to be a result of credit-related factors, are to be included as a charge in the statement of income, while unrealized losses considered to be a result of 
non-credit-related
 factors are to be included as a component of shareholders’ equity. Investments whose values are based on quoted market prices in active markets are classified within Level 1. Investments that trade in markets that are not considered to be active, but are valued based on quoted market prices, are classified within Level 2. As Level 2 investments include positions that are not traded in active markets, valuations may be adjusted to reflect illiquidity and/or 
non-transferability,
 which are generally based on available market information. Any transfers between levels are recognized as of the beginning of any reporting period. Fair value of the bond portfolio was determined using Level 1 inputs related to money market investments and Level 2 inputs related to investment-grade corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, commercial paper and direct obligations of government agencies. Unrealized losses, net of unrealized gains, on the investments in the bond portfolio were $
3,573,000
 and $
6,382,000
 at December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively.

The Company believes unrealized losses on investments were primarily caused by rising interest rates rather than changes in credit quality. The Company expects to recover, through collection of all of the contractual cash flows of each security, the amortized cost basis of these securities as it does not intend to sell, and does not anticipate being required to sell, these securities before recovery of the cost basis. For these reasons, no losses have been recognized in the Company’s consolidated statements of income.
Short-term investments include $
51,619,000
 in current maturities of investments held by the Company’s insurance segment at December 28, 2024. The 
non-current
 portion of the bond portfolio of $
92,246,000
 is included in other assets. The short-term investments, together with $
30,960,000
 of 
non-current
 investments, provide collateral for the $
74,321,000
 of letters of credit issued to guarantee payment of insurance claims. 
Investment income represents the earnings on the insurance segment’s assets. Investment income earned from the assets of the insurance segment are included as a component of operating income as the investment of these assets is critical to providing collateral, liquidity and earnings with respect to the operation of the Company’s insurance programs.

The Company files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. The Company or its subsidiaries file state tax returns in the majority of the U.S. state tax jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company and its subsidiaries are no longer subject to U.S. federal or state income tax examinations by tax authorities for 2020 and prior years. The Company’s wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary, Landstar Canada, Inc., is subject to Canadian income and other taxes. The Company’s wholly-owned Mexican subsidiaries, Landstar Holdings, S. de R.L.C.V. and Landstar Metro, S.A.P.I. de C.V., are subject to Mexican income and other taxes. The Company’s Canadian and Mexican subsidiaries also may each be subject to U.S. income and other taxes. 

As of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the Company had $
5,396,000
 and $
4,467,000
, respectively, of net unrecognized tax benefits representing the provision for the uncertainty of certain tax positions plus a component of interest and penalties. Estimated interest and penalties on the provision for the uncertainty of certain tax positions is included in income tax expense. At December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, there was $
1,793,000
 and $
1,249,000
, respectively, accrued for estimated interest and penalties related to the uncertainty of certain tax positions. The Company does not currently anticipate any significant increase or decrease to the unrecognized tax benefit during fiscal year 2025.

 in fiscal year 2023 and $
30,659,000

(6) Retirement Plan 

Landstar sponsors an Internal Revenue Code section 401(k) defined contribution plan for the benefit of U.S. domiciled full-time employees who have completed three months of service. Eligible employees make voluntary contributions up to 
75
% of their base salary, subject to certain limitations. Landstar contributes an amount equal to 
100
% of the first 
3
% and 
50
% of the next 
2
% of such contributions, subject to certain limitations. 
The expense for the Company-sponsored defined contribution plan included in selling, general and administrative expense was $
2,805,000
 in fiscal year 2024, $
2,812,000
 in fiscal year 2023 and $
2,716,000
 in fiscal year 2022. 
(7) Debt 
Other than the finance lease obligations as presented on the consolidated balance sheets, the Company had 
no
 outstanding debt as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023. 
On

July 1, 2022
, Landstar entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement with a bank syndicate led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (as further amended as of June 21, 2024, the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement, which matures July 1, 2027, provides for borrowing capacity in the form of a revolving credit facility of $
300,000,000
, $
45,000,000
 of which may be utilized in the form of letters of credit. The Credit Agreement also includes an “accordion” feature providing for a possible increase of up to an aggregate amount of borrowing capacity of $
600,000,000
. As of December 28, 2024, the Company had 
no
 borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement. 
The revolving credit loans under the Credit Agreement, at the option of Landstar, bear interest at (i) a forward-looking term rate based on the secured overnight financing rate plus 
0.10
% and an applicable margin ranging from 
1.25
% to 
2.00
%, or (ii) an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 
0.25
% to 
1.00
%, in each case with the applicable margin determined based upon the Company’s Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, at the end of the most recent applicable fiscal quarter for which financial statements have been delivered. The revolving credit facility bears a commitment fee, payable quarterly in arrears, of 
0.20
% to 
0.30
%, based on the Company’s Leverage Ratio at the end of the most recent applicable fiscal quarter for which financial statements have been delivered. 
The Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants that limit, among other things, the incurrence of additional indebtedness. The Company is required to, among other things, maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, as described in the Credit Agreement, and maintain a Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, below a specified maximum. The Credit Agreement provides for a restriction on cash dividends and other distributions to stockholders on the Company’s capital stock to the extent there is a default under the Credit Agreement. In addition, the Credit Agreement under certain circumstances limits the amount of such cash dividends and other distributions to stockholders to the extent that, after giving effect to any payment made to effect such cash dividend or other distribution, the Leverage Ratio would exceed 
2.5
 to 1 on a pro forma basis as of the end of the Company’s most recently completed fiscal quarter. The Credit Agreement provides for an event of default in the event that, among other things, a person or group acquires 
35
% or more of the outstanding capital stock of the Company or obtains power to elect a majority of the 

52

Table of Contents
Company’s directors or the directors cease to consist of a majority of Continuing Directors, as defined in the Credit Agreement. None of these covenants are presently considered by management to be materially restrictive to the Company’s operations, capital resources or liquidity. 
The Company is currently in compliance with all of the debt covenants under the Credit Agreement.
The interest rates on borrowings under the revolving credit facility are typically tied to short-term interest rates and, as such, carrying value approximates fair value. Interest rates on borrowings under finance leases approximate the interest rates that would currently be available to the Company under similar terms and, as such, carrying value approximates fair value. 
Landstar paid interest of $
3,813,000
 in fiscal year 2024, $
3,604,000
 in fiscal year 2023 and $
4,151,000
 in fiscal year 2022. 
(8) Leases 
Landstar’s noncancelable leases are primarily comprised of finance leases for the acquisition of new trailing equipment. Each finance lease for the acquisition of trailing equipment is a 
five year
 lease with a $
1
 purchase option for the applicable equipment at lease expiration. Substantially all of Landstar’s operating lease 
right-of-use
 assets and operating lease liabilities represent leases for facilities maintained in support of the Company’s network of BCO Independent Contractors and office space used to conduct Landstar’s business. These leases do not have significant rent escalation holidays, concessions, leasehold improvement incentives or other 
build-out
 clauses. Further, the leases do not contain contingent rent provisions. Landstar also rents certain trailing equipment to supplement the Company-owned trailer fleet under 
“month-to-month”
 lease terms, which are not required to be recorded on the balance sheet due to the less than twelve month lease term exemption. Sublease income is primarily comprised of weekly trailing equipment rentals to BCO Independent Contractors. 
Most of Landstar’s operating leases include one or more options to renew. The exercise of lease renewal options is typically at Landstar’s sole discretion, and, as such, the majority of renewals to extend the lease terms are not included in the 
right-of-use
 assets and lease liabilities as they are not reasonably certain of exercise. Landstar regularly evaluates the renewal options, and when they are reasonably certain of exercise, Landstar includes the renewal period in the lease term.
As most of Landstar’s operating leases do not provide an implicit rate, Landstar utilized its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of the lease payments. Landstar has a centrally managed treasury function; therefore, based on the applicable lease terms and the current economic environment, the Company applies a portfolio approach for determining the incremental borrowing rate.

Represents additional shares earned under each of the February 2, 2017, February 2, 2018 and February 1, 2019 RSU awards, as fiscal year 2021 financial results exceeded target performance level under each such award. 

(2)

Represents additional shares earned (i) under the February 1, 2019 and January 31, 2020 RSU awards as fiscal year 2022 financial results exceeded target performance level and (ii) under the April 24, 2018 and July 1, 2019 RSU awards as total shareholder return during the applicable performance period exceeded target performance level under each of those awards. 

(3)

Represents additional shares earned under the April 24, 2018 and July 1, 2019 RSU awards as total shareholder return during the applicable performance period exceeded target performance level under each of those awards. 

During fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company granted RSUs with a performance condition. During fiscal year 2024, the Company also granted RSUs with a market condition. 

RSUs with a performance condition granted on February 2, 2024 may vest on January 31 of 2027, 2028 and 2029 based on growth in operating income and 
pre-tax
 income per diluted share from continuing operations as compared to the results from the 2023 fiscal year. RSUs with a performance condition granted on February 3, 2023 may vest on January 31 of 2026, 2027 and 2028 based on growth in operating income and 
pre-tax
 income per diluted share from continuing operations as compared to the results from the 2022 fiscal year. RSUs with a performance condition granted on January 28, 2022 may vest on January 31 of 2025, 2026 and 2027 based on growth in operating income and 
pre-tax
 income per diluted share from continuing operations as compared to the results from the 2021 fiscal year. At the time of grant, the target number of common shares available for issuance under the February 2, 2024, February 3, 2023 and January 28, 2022 grants equals 
100
% of the number of RSUs granted, and the maximum number of common shares available for issuance under the February 2, 2024, February 3, 2023 and January 28, 2022 grants equals 
200
% of the number of RSUs credited to the recipient. In the event actual results exceed the target, the number of shares that will be granted will exceed the number of RSUs granted. The fair value of an RSU with a performance condition was determined based on the market value of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of grant, discounted for lack of marketability for a minimum post-vesting holding requirement. The discount rate due to lack of marketability used for RSU award grants with a performance condition for all periods was 
7
%. With respect to RSU awards with a performance condition, the Company reports compensation expense over the life of the award based on an estimated number of units that will vest over the life of the award, multiplied by the fair value of an RSU at the time of grant.

55

Table of Contents
On February 2, 2024, the Company granted 
58,268

RSUs that vest based on a market condition. These RSUs may vest based on the Company’s achievement of a target total shareholder return (“TSR”) compound annual growth rate (adjusted to reflect dividends (if any) paid during the period the awards are outstanding and capital adjustments as may be necessary), to be measured annually starting after the sixth anniversary of the grant date and concluding after the tenth anniversary of the grant date. The fair value of this RSU award was determined at the time of grant based on the expected achievement of the market condition. With respect to these RSU awards, the Company reports compensation expense ratably over the service period of the award based on the number of units granted multiplied by the grant date fair value of the RSU. Previously recognized compensation cost would be reversed only if the employee did not complete the requisite service period due to termination of employment. 
The Company recognized approximately ($
800,000
), $
581,000
 and $
9,100,000
 of share-based compensation (benefit) expense related to RSU awards in fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 28, 2024, there was a maximum of $
41.9
 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to RSU awards granted under the Plans with an expected average remaining life of approximately 
3.3
 years. With respect to RSU awards with a performance condition, the amount of future compensation expense to be recognized will be determined based on future operating results.

the Company’s Common Stock on the date of grant. Shares of 
non-vested
 restricted stock are generally subject to vesting in three equal annual installments either on the first, second and third anniversary of the date of grant or the third, fourth and fifth anniversary of the date of the grant, in two equal annual installments on the first and second anniversary of the date of the grant or 
100
% on the first, third or fifth anniversary of the date of the grant. For restricted stock awards granted under the 2022 DSCP, each recipient may elect to defer receipt of shares and instead receive restricted stock units (“Deferred Stock Units”), which represent contingent rights to receive shares of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of recipient separation
 from service from the Board of Directors, or, if earlier, upon a change in control event of the Company. Deferred Stock Units become vested 
100
% on the first anniversary of the date of the grant. Deferred Stock Units do not represent actual ownership in shares of the Company’s Common Stock and the recipient does not have voting rights or other incidents of ownership until the shares are issued. However, Deferred Stock Units do contain the right to receive dividend equivalent payments prior to settlement into shares. 
As of December 28, 2024, there was $
4,684,000
 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to 
non-vested
 shares of restricted stock and Deferred Stock Units granted under the Plans. The unrecognized compensation cost related to these 
non-vested
 shares of restricted stock and Deferred Stock Units is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 
1.6
 years.

Stock Options 
The Company did not grant any stock options during its 2022, 2023 or 2024 fiscal years. Options outstanding under the Plans generally become exercisable in either five equal annual installments commencing on the first anniversary of the date of grant or 
100
% on the fifth anniversary from the date of grant, subject to acceleration in certain circumstances. All options granted under the Plans expire on the tenth anniversary of the date of grant. Under the Plans, the exercise price of each option equals the fair market value of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of grant. 
The fair value of each option grant on its grant date was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company utilized historical data, including exercise patterns and employee departure behavior, in estimating the term that options will be outstanding. Expected volatility was based on historical volatility and other factors, such as expected changes in volatility arising from planned changes to the Company’s business, if any. The risk-free interest rate was based on the yield of zero coupon U.S. Treasury bonds for terms that approximated the terms of the options granted. 
The Company had 
no
 issued and outstanding vested or unvested stock options or unrecognized compensation costs related to 
non-vested
 stock options granted under the Plans as of or for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2024.

(11) Commitments and Contingencies 
At December 28, 2024, in addition to the $
74,321,000
 letters of credit secured by investments, Landstar had $
35,250,000
 of letters of credit outstanding under the Company’s Credit Agreement. 
The Company is involved in certain claims and pending litigation arising from the normal conduct of business. Many of these claims are covered in whole or in part by insurance. Based on knowledge of the facts and, in certain cases, opinions of outside counsel, management believes that adequate provisions have been made for probable losses with respect to the resolution of all such claims and pending litigation and that the ultimate outcome, after provisions therefor, will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company, but could have a material effect on the results of operations in a given quarter or year. 

(12) Segment Information 
Landstar markets its integrated transportation management solutions primarily through independent commission sales agents and exclusively utilizes third party capacity providers to transport customers’ freight. Landstar’s independent commission sales agents enter into contractual arrangements with the Company and are responsible for locating freight, making that freight available to Landstar’s capacity providers and coordinating the transportation of the freight with customers and capacity providers. The Company’s third party capacity providers consist of independent contractors who provide truck capacity to the Company under exclusive lease arrangements (the “BCO Independent Contractors”), unrelated trucking companies who provide truck capacity to the Company under 
non-exclusive
 contractual arrangements (the “Truck Brokerage Carriers”), air cargo carriers, ocean cargo carriers and railroads. Through this network of agents and capacity providers linked together by Landstar’s ecosystem of digital technologies, Landstar operates an integrated transportation management solutions business primarily throughout North America with revenue of $
4.8
 billion during the most recently completed fiscal year. The Company reports the results of 
two
 operating segments: the transportation logistics segment and the insurance segment. 

The transportation logistics segment provides a wide range of integrated transportation management solutions. Transportation services offered by the Company include truckload, less-than-truckload and other truck transportation, rail intermodal, air cargo, ocean cargo, expedited ground and air delivery of time-critical freight, heavy-haul/specialized, U.S.-Canada and U.S.-Mexico cross-border, intra-Mexico, intra-Canada, project cargo and customs brokerage. Examples of the industries serviced by the transportation logistics segment include automotive parts and assemblies, consumer durables, building products, metals, chemicals, foodstuffs, heavy machinery, retail, electronics and military equipment and general commodities. In addition, the transportation logistics segment provides transportation services to other transportation companies, including third party logistics and less-than-truckload service providers. The independent commission sales agents market services provided by the transportation logistics segment. Billings for freight transportation services are typically charged to customers on a per shipment basis for the physical transportation of freight and are referred to as transportation revenue. The results of operations from Landstar Blue and Landstar Metro are presented as part of the Company’s transportation logistics segment. 

The insurance segment is comprised of Signature Insurance Company (“Signature”), a wholly owned offshore insurance subsidiary, and Risk Management Claim Services, Inc. The insurance segment provides risk and claims management services to certain of Landstar’s operating subsidiaries. In addition, it reinsures certain risks of the Company’s BCO Independent Contractors and provides certain property and casualty insurance directly to certain of Landstar’s operating subsidiaries. Revenue at the insurance segment represents reinsurance premiums from third party insurance companies that provide insurance programs to BCO Independent Contractors where all or a portion of the risk is ultimately borne by Signature. Internal revenue for premiums billed by the insurance segment to the transportation logistics segment is calculated each fiscal period based primarily on an actuarial calculation of historical loss experience and is believed to approximate the cost that would have been incurred by the transportation logistics segment had similar insurance been obtained from an unrelated third party. 

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. The Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) is our Chief Executive Officer. The CODM evaluates each segment’s performance and makes decisions about resource allocations primarily based on operating income, which is the principal financial metric utilized to monitor budgeted versus actual results by segment of the Company. Asset information by segment is not typically provided to the CODM for purposes of evaluating performance or allocating resources, and therefore such information has not been presented. 

No
 single customer accounted for more than 
10
% of the Company’s consolidated revenue in fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022. Substantially all of the Company’s revenue is generated in North America, primarily through customers located in the United States.

(13) Change in Accounting Estimate for Self-Insured Claims 

Landstar provides for the estimated costs of self-insured claims primarily on an actuarial basis. The amount recorded for the estimated liability for claims incurred is based upon the facts and circumstances known on the applicable balance sheet date. The ultimate resolution of these claims may be for an amount greater or less than the amount estimated by management. The Company continually revises its existing claim estimates as new or revised information becomes available on the status of each claim. Historically, the Company has experienced both favorable and unfavorable development of prior years’ claims estimates within its various programs. 

The following table summarizes the adverse effect of the increase in the cost of insurance claims resulting from unfavorable development of prior year self-insured claims estimates on operating income, net income and earnings per share set forth in the consolidated statements of income for the fiscal years ended December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 (in thousands, except per share amounts):

The unfavorable development of prior years’ claims in the fiscal years ended December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was primarily attributable in each year to several specific claims. 

(14) Equity investment 

On April 1, 2022, Landstar Investment Holdco, LLC, a newly formed Delaware LLC and wholly owned subsidiary of Landstar System Holdings, Inc., purchased Class A units of Cavnue, LLC, for approximately $
4,999,000
 in cash consideration. Cavnue, LLC is a privately held company focused on combining technology and road infrastructure to unlock the full potential of connected and autonomous vehicles. 

60

Table of Contents

This non-controlling investment in units of Cavnue, LLC, is considered an investment in non-marketable equity securities without
 a

readily
 determinable market value. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities going forward will be adjusted to fair value upon observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as the measurement alternative). 

(15) Gain Contingency 

The Company does not allow for the recognition of a gain contingency within its consolidated financial statements prior to the settlement of the underlying events or contingencies associated with the gain contingency. As a result, the consideration related to a gain contingency is recorded in the consolidated financial statements during the period in which all underlying events or contingencies are resolved and the gain is realized. It is anticipated that during the 2025 second fiscal quarter, the Company will receive a $
12,000,000

cash payment from a third party reinsurance provider in the form of a “no claims bonus” resulting from favorable loss experience under a three year commercial auto liability reinsurance arrangement relating to claims incurred between May 1, 2020 through April 30, 2023. The Company intends to record the receipt of this payment as a deferred gain on the balance sheet, until such time as all underlying claims with exposure under the applicable excess layer insurance arrangement are resolved and the gain can be recognized. 

(16) Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

Adoption of New Accounting Standards 

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures 
(“ASU 2023-07”), which expands disclosures about a public entity’s reportable segments and requires more enhanced information about a reportable segment’s expenses, interim segment profit or loss, and how a public entity’s chief operating decision maker uses reported segment profit or loss information in assessing segment performance and allocating resources. ASU 2023-07 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 on December 28, 2024 retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the consolidated financial statements. 

Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted 

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures 
(“ASU 2023-09”), which expands disclosures in an entity’s income tax rate reconciliation table and regarding cash taxes paid both in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. ASU 2023-09 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, 
Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income – Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
 (“ASU 2024-03”), which expands disclosures about certain categories of expenses. ASU 2024-03 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2024-03 on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors 

Landstar System, Inc.: 

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Landstar System, Inc. and subsidiary (the Company) as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 28, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 28, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 24, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 

Basis for Opinion 

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matter 

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

Self-insurance claims liability 

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the liability for insurance claims includes the actuarially determined estimated costs of cargo, property, casualty, general liability, and workers’ compensation claims, both reported and for claims incurred but not reported, up to the Company’s retained amount per claim, which is referred to as the self-insurance claims liability. The Company’s estimated costs of insurance claims include assumptions regarding the frequency and severity of claims and are based upon the facts and circumstances known as of the applicable balance sheet date. The Company’s liability for insurance claims as of December 28, 2024 was $103,353,000, which includes the self-insurance claims liability. 

62 

Table of Contents

We identified the evaluation of the self-insurance claims liability as a critical audit matter. Specialized skills were needed to evaluate the Company’s estimate of the self-insurance claims liability. This evaluation included assumptions related to the potential for the development in future periods of claims both reported and incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date and the impact of those developments on the estimated liability associated with such claims. In addition, a higher degree of subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate the Company’s estimate of the self-insurance claims liability due to the inherent uncertainty in the frequency and severity of claims. 

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company’s self-insurance claims process, including a control related to the development of the assumptions used to estimate the self-insurance claims liability. We involved actuarial professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in assessing the actuarial model used by the Company, including the external actuarial report obtained by the Company, to estimate the self-insurance claims liability for consistency with generally accepted actuarial standards. The actuarial professionals also developed an estimate of the range of the self-insurance claims liability using the Company’s historical claims data. We compared the estimated range of the self-insurance claims liability to the amount recorded by the Company. We tested a sample of the claims data used in the actuarial model by comparing the data to underlying claims details. For certain claims, we obtained letters received directly from the Company’s external legal counsel to evaluate the liability recorded. Additionally, we assessed the development of the self-insurance claims liability in the current year compared to recent historical trends and considered implications on the current year assumptions. We also assessed facts and circumstances received by the Company after the balance sheet date, but before the consolidated financial statements were issued, and the impact, if any, of such facts and circumstances on the self-insurance claims liability.

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 28, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 24, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, an evaluation was carried out, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 28, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms. 

In designing and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures, Company management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Because of the inherent limitation in any control system, no evaluation or implementation of a control system can provide complete assurance that all control issues and all possible instances of fraud have been or will be detected. 

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

(a) Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Management of Landstar System, Inc. (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act, as amended. 

Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements. 

Management, with the participation of the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2024. This assessment was performed using the criteria established under the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). 

Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error or circumvention or overriding of internal control. Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and reporting and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Based on the assessment performed using the criteria established by COSO, management has concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2024.
