S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements about our plans and expectations of what may happen in the future. Forward-looking statements are based on a number of assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject to significant risks and uncertainties, and our results could differ materially from the results anticipated by our forward-looking statements as a result of many known or unknown factors, including, but not limited to, those factors discussed in “Risk Factors.” See also the “Special Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” set forth at the beginning of this report.

You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” and our consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this report.

Overview

TG Therapeutics is a fully-integrated, commercial stage, biopharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of novel treatments for B-cell mediated diseases. TG has received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for BRIUMVI® (ublituximab-xiiy) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS), to include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease and active secondary progressive disease, in adults, as well as approval by the European Commission (EC) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for BRIUMVI to treat adult patients with RMS who have active disease defined by clinical or imaging features in Europe and the United Kingdom (UK), respectively.

We also actively evaluate complementary products, technologies and companies for in-licensing, partnership, acquisition and/or investment opportunities.  

In February of 2021, we announced that the FDA granted accelerated approval of umbralisib, the Company’s PI3K delta inhibitor, then commercially referred to as UKONIQ, for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory MZL who have received at least one prior anti-CD20 based regimen and adult patients with relapsed or refractory FL who have received at least three prior lines of systemic therapy. In April of 2022, we announced the voluntary withdrawal of UKONIQ from sale for the approved indications. Our only source of product revenues during the year ended December 31, 2022 was from the sale of UKONIQ. Our only source of product revenues during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2024, was from the sale of BRIUMVI. Product revenues are recorded net of estimates of variable consideration. For further discussion of our revenue recognition policy, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgements and Estimates” below.

Cost of revenue consists primarily of materials and third-party manufacturing costs, as well as freight and royalties owed to our licensing partner for BRIUMVI sales. Based on our policy to expense costs associated with the manufacture of our products prior to regulatory approval, a portion of the manufacturing costs of BRIUMVI units recognized as revenue during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2024 were expensed prior to receipt of FDA approval on December  28, 2022, and therefore are not included in costs of product revenue during those periods.​

Our other research and development expenses consist primarily of expenses relating to the design, development, manufacture, testing and enhancement of our drug candidates and technologies, milestone expenses related to in-licensing of new product candidates, fees paid to consultants and outside service providers for clinical and laboratory development, personnel expenses and other facilities-related expenses. We expense our research and development costs as they are incurred. Research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were approximately $83.1 million, $63.2 million and $112.1 million respectively, excluding noncash compensation expenses related to research and development.

      79

Table of Contents

Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of expenses related to the commercialization of our approved products, including salaries and related expenses for our commercialization team and commercial development activities. Other selling, general and administrative expenses consist of executive, finance and other administrative personnel, recruitment expenses, professional fees and other corporate expenses, including investor relations, legal activities and facilities-related expenses.

Our results of operations include noncash compensation expenses as a result of stock-based compensation costs related to equity awards, restricted stock and options, granted to employees and non-employees. Stock-based compensation costs are measured at the date of grant based on the fair value of the award. We estimate the grant date fair value of options, and the resulting stock-based compensation expense, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Equity awards with market conditions are valued using advanced option-pricing models, such as a Monte Carlo simulation. The effect of a market condition is reflected in the award’s fair value on the grant date. For time-based or performance-based restricted stock, the fair value is based on the market value of our common stock on the date of grant. Stock-based compensation expense for time-based restricted stock and options is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Stock-based compensation expense for awards that vest upon the achievement of milestones is recognized over the requisite service period when the achievement of such milestones becomes probable. Stock-based compensation expense for an award that has a market condition is recognized over the requisite service period, which is derived from the valuation model, even if the market condition is never satisfied. We recognize all stock-based payments to employees and non-employee directors (as compensation for service) as noncash compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.

Product Revenue, net
. 
Product revenue, net was approximately $313.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $92.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in product revenue, net is driven by an increase in product shipments for BRIUMVI as a result of greater market penetration. BRIUMVI, was commercially launched in the U.S. in January 2023, following FDA approval.

License, Milestone, Royalty and Other

Revenue. 
License, milestone, royalty and other revenue was $15.3 million for the year ended December 30, 2024 compared to approximately $141.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. License, milestone, royalty and other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024 is comprised of a $12.5 million milestone payment under the Neuraxpharm Commercialization Agreement for the first key market commercial launch of BRIUMVI in the EU, as well as consideration received for development and regulatory activities performed on behalf of Neuraxpharm in accordance with the Commercialization Agreement. License, milestone, royalty and other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 is predominantly comprised of recognition of the one-time $140.0 million non-refundable upfront payment under the Commercialization Agreement with Neuraxpharm (see Note 2 for more information). ​

 ​

Cost of Revenue. 
Cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $38.5 million compared to approximately $14.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.  Cost of revenue for both the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 consists primarily of third-party manufacturing, distribution, overhead costs and royalties owed to our licensing partner for BRIUMVI sales. A portion of the costs of producing BRIUMVI sold to date was expensed as research and development prior to the FDA approval of BRIUMVI and therefore it is not reflected in the cost of revenue. We expect the cost of revenue for BRIUMVI to increase in relation to product revenues as we deplete these inventories. We expect to use the remaining pre-commercialization inventory for product sales through the first quarter of 2025, after which our product gross margin is anticipated to decrease modestly. The cost of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024 and  December 31, 2023 includes $2.4 million and $1.5 million, respectively, of costs related to delivering regulatory support and development services to Neuraxpharm in accordance with the Commercialization Agreement.

Noncash Compensation Expense (Research and Development).
 Noncash compensation expense (research and development) related to equity incentive grants totaled $11.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to $13.0 million during the comparable period in 2023. The decrease in noncash compensation expense was primarily due to decreased vesting of milestone-based grants during the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.

Other Research and Development Expense
.
 Other research and development expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2024, by approximately $19.9 million to $83.1 million as compared to the prior year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in other research and development expense during the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily attributable to manufacturing and development costs incurred in connection with our ublituximab subcutaneous development work, increased personnel and costs associated with the Precision License Agreement incurred during the period.

Noncash Compensation Expense (Selling, General and Administrative). 
Noncash compensation expense (selling, general and administrative) related to equity incentive grants totaled $31.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to $24.9 million during the comparable period in 2024. The increase in noncash compensation expense was primarily due to greater recognition of noncash compensation expense for grants to executives during the year ended December 31, 2024.

Other Selling, General and Administrative. 
Other selling, general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2024, by approximately $25.1 million to $122.9 million as compared to the prior year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to other selling, general and administrative costs, including personnel, consultants, and third parties associated with the commercialization of BRIUMVI during the year ended December 31, 2024.

Interest Expense. 
Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $24.0 million compared to $12.6 million for the comparable period ended December 31, 2023. The $11.4 million increase is mainly due to $4.6 million of debt extinguishments costs incurred pertaining to the First Amendment with Hercules as well as increased interest expense pertaining to the Initial Term Loan with Blue during the same period (see Note 7 for more information).

Other Income. 
Other income increased by $2.7 million to $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase is mainly due to greater accretion income earned from short-term investment securities during the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the prior period.

Income Taxes. 
Income tax increased by $1.8 million to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to $0.4 for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase is due to state tax liabilities incurred during the year ended December 31, 2024.

Product Revenues, net
. 
Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased compared to the comparable period ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to an increase in net product revenues from sales of our sole commercial product, BRIUMVI, which was commercially launched in the U.S. in January 2023, following FDA approval. Product revenue, net for the year ended December 31, 2022, consisted of net product sales of UKONIQ, which was officially withdrawn from the market in May 2022.

License Revenue
. License revenue was $140.2 million and $0.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. License revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 is predominantly comprised of recognition of license revenue from the one-time $140.0 million non-refundable upfront payment recognized in the third quarter of 2023 as part of the Commercialization Agreement with Neuraxpharm (see Note 2 for more information). License revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 is comprised of recognition of a portion of the upfront payment from the ublituximab sublicense agreement with Ildong.

Other Revenue
. Other revenue was $1.5 million and zero for the year ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 is comprised of consideration received for development and regulatory activities performed on behalf of Neuraxpharm in accordance with the Commercialization Agreement.

      82

Table of Contents

Cost of Product Revenue. 
Cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased compared to the comparable period ended December 31, 2022 due to increased product sales resulting from the commercial launch of BRIUMVI in the U.S. market  which began in January 2023 following FDA approval. During the year ended December 31, 2023 the cost of revenue consisted primarily of third-party manufacturing, distribution, overhead costs and royalties on net sales of BRIUMVI owed to our licensing partner. Based on our policy to expense costs associated with the manufacture of our products prior to regulatory approval, a portion of the manufacturing costs of BRIUMVI units recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2023 were expensed as research and development expenses prior to receipt of FDA approval, and therefore are not reflected in the cost of revenue. We expect the cost of revenue for BRIUMVI to increase in relation to product revenues as we deplete these inventories and we expect to use the remaining pre-commercialization inventory for product sales through the first quarter of 2025.

Noncash Compensation Expense (Research and Development).
 Noncash compensation expense (research and development) related to equity incentive grants totaled $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to $13.2 million during the comparable period in 2022.

Other Research and Development Expense
. 
Other research and development expense decreased for the year ended December 31, 2023, by approximately $48.9 million to $63.2 million as compared to the prior year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in other research and development expense during the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily attributable to reduced manufacturing expense, a decrease in license milestones and reduced clinical trial related expenses. Prior to the approval of BRIUMVI, manufacturing costs pertaining to BRIUMVI were expensed to research and development expense in the period incurred, and following approval are reflected in inventory. 

Noncash Compensation Expense (Selling, General and Administrative). 
Noncash compensation expense (selling, general and administrative) related to equity incentive grants totaled $24.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to $31.4 million during the comparable period in 2022. The decrease in noncash compensation expense was primarily due to greater recognition of noncash compensation expense for grants to executives during the year ended December 31, 2022.

Other Selling, General and Administrative. 
Other selling, general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2023, by approximately $33.9 million to $97.8 million as compared to the prior year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to other selling, general and administrative costs, including personnel and consultants, associated with the approval and commercialization of BRIUMVI, as well as increase in advisory fees pertaining to the Commercialization Agreement with Neuraxpharm during the year ended December 31, 2023.

Interest Expense. 
Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $12.6 million compared to $10.2 million for the comparable period ended December 31, 2022. The $2.4 million increase is mainly due to greater interest expense related to First Amendment to the Amended Loan Agreement.

Other Income.

Other income increased by $0.3 million to $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Income Taxes.
 Income tax increased by $0.4 million to $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to zero for the year ended December 31, 2022. The $0.4 million increase is due to state tax liabilities incurred during the year ended December 31, 2023.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Historically, we have incurred operating losses since our inception; however, during the year ended December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023 the Company generated net income. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company experienced a net profit due to a $140.0 million non-refundable upfront payment recognized as license revenue in the third quarter of 2023 as part of our Commercialization Agreement with Neuraxpharm (see Note 2 for more information). We may incur operating losses in the near term and may never become profitable. As of December 31, 2024, we have an accumulated deficit of $1.5 billion.

Our major sources of cash have been proceeds from private placements and public offerings of equity securities, from our loan and security agreements, the upfront payment from the Commercialization Agreement (see Note 2 for more information), and from product revenue from drug sales of BRIUMVI. Substantially all our operating losses have resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from selling, general and administrative costs associated with our operations, including our commercialization activities. As of December 31, 2024, we generated $313.7 million in product revenue from sales of BRIUMVI. BRIUMVI first became commercially available in the United States in January 2023. Even with the commercialization of BRIUMVI and the possible future commercialization of our other drug candidates, we may not realize continued profitability. Our ability to achieve continued profitability depends on our ability to generate revenue and many other factors, including our ability to successfully commercialize our drug candidates alone or in partnership; successfully complete any post-approval regulatory obligations and our ability to maintain or obtain regulatory approval for our drug candidates. We may incur operating losses even now that we are generating revenues from BRIUMVI.

As of December 31, 2024, we had $311.0 million in cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investment securities. We anticipate that our cash, cash equivalents, and investment securities as of December 31, 2024, combined with projected revenues associated with the sale of BRIUMVI in the U.S. and ex-U.S.,  will provide sufficient liquidity for more than a twelve-month period from the date of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The actual amount of cash that we will need to operate is subject to many factors, including, but not limited to, our commercialization efforts for BRIUMVI, and the timing, design and conduct of clinical trials for our drug candidates as well as the costs associated with licensing or otherwise acquiring new product candidates. We may be dependent upon significant future financing to provide the cash necessary to execute our ongoing and future operations, including the commercialization of any of our drug candidates.

Cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $40.5 million as compared to $31.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in net cash used in operating activities was due to higher operating expenditures and an increase in cash used for inventory purchases during the year ended December 31, 2024.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was $1.0 million as compared to $50.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to lower maturities of short-term securities during the year ended December 31, 2023, mainly based on timing of maturities.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was $128.5 million as compared to $72.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2024 is mainly due to the proceeds from the new loan with Blue Owl, offset by the payoff of our prior loan with Hercules.

ATM Program

On September 2, 2022, we filed an automatic “shelf registration” statement on Form S-3 (the 2022 WKSI Shelf) as a “well-known seasoned issuer” as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act, which registered an unlimited and indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future issuance and sale. The 2022 WKSI Shelf was declared effective in September 2022. In connection with the 2022 WKSI Shelf, we entered into an At-the-Market Issuance Sales Agreement (the 2022 ATM) with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. and B. Riley Securities, Inc. (each a 2022 Agent and collectively, the 2022 Agents), relating to the sale of shares of our common stock. Under the 2022 ATM, we will pay the 2022 Agents a commission rate of up to 3.0% of the gross proceeds from the sale of any shares of common stock. The 2022 ATM is our only active ATM program.

During the year ended December 31, 2023, we sold a total of 1,385,700 shares of common stock under the 2022 ATM for aggregate total gross proceeds of approximately $47.1 million at an average selling price of $34.01 per share, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $46.3 million after deducting commissions and other transactions costs. 

We had no activity on the 2022 ATM during the year ended December 31, 2024.

The 2022 WKSI Shelf is currently our only active shelf registration statement. We may offer any combination of the securities registered under the 2022 WKSI Shelf from time to time in response to market conditions or other circumstances if we believe such a plan of financing is in the best interests of our stockholders. We may need to file additional shelf registration statements in the future to provide us with the flexibility to raise additional capital to finance our operations as needed.

Debt Financings

On March 31, 2023 (the First Amendment Effective Date), the Company entered into a First Amendment to the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the First Amendment) with Hercules Capital, Inc. (Hercules). The First Amendment amended the terms of the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (Amended Loan Agreement) with Hercules that closed on December 30, 2021. The First Amendment amended the terms of the Amended Loan Agreement to, among other things, (i) issue an advance of $25.0 million drawn at the First Amendment Effective Date (the Tranche 3A Advance), (ii) provide for the formal expiration of Tranche 2, (iii) change the draw amounts and dates available under subsequent tranches, including splitting the remaining balance of Tranche 3 into two additional advances in an aggregate principal amount of up to $20.0 million, in increments of $10.0 million (a Tranche 3B Advance and a Tranche 3C Advance), decreasing the amount available under Tranche 4 from $65.0 million to $60.0 million, and adding a Tranche 5 of $25.0 million, subject to the achievement of revenue related performance milestones, (iv) extend the interest only period from February 1, 2025 to August 1, 2025 and (v) modify the cash interest rate to be the greater of either (a) the “prime rate” as reported in The Wall Street Journal plus 1.20%, and (b) 8.95%. In addition to the cash interest rate, the principal balance will accrue paid-in-kind interest at a rate of 2.25%, which amount will be capitalized and added to the outstanding principal balance of the Amended Term Loan and payable at the maturity date of the Amended Loan Agreement, as amended, The Amended Loan Agreement, as amended, contains financial covenants that require the Company to maintain certain levels of unrestricted cash and additional financial covenants related to market capitalization. 

The Amended Loan Agreement, as amended also contains warrant coverage of 2.95% of the total amount funded. A warrant (the Warrant) was issued by the Company to Hercules to purchase 115,042 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $17.95 for the initial amount funded at the Closing Date. The Warrant shall be exercisable for seven years from the date of issuance. Hercules may exercise the Warrant either by (a) cash or check or (b) through a net issuance conversion. Additionally, a warrant was issued by the Company to Hercules to purchase 50,172 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $14.70 for the amount funded pertaining to the Tranche 3A Advance (the First Amendment Warrant). The First Amendment Warrant shall be exercisable for seven years from the date of issuance. Hercules may exercise the First Amendment Warrant either by (a) cash or check or (b) through a net issuance conversion.

On August 2, 2024 (the New Closing Date), the Company entered into a term loan facility of $250 million (the Initial Term Loan) with Blue Owl Capital Corporation, as administrative agent (the Administrative Agent), HealthCare Royalty and Blue Owl Capital under the Financing Agreement (as defined below). The Company repaid all outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees under the First Amendment with Hercules (such repayment, the Refinancing), which Refinancing was funded with the proceeds of the Initial Term Loan. The existing Amended Loan Agreement with Hercules was effectively terminated, and all guarantees and liens granted thereunder were released upon the consummation of the Refinancing.

The Initial Term Loan is governed by a financing agreement, dated as of the New Closing Date (the Financing Agreement), which provides for (i) a single draw of the Initial Term Loan on the New Closing Date and (ii) an uncommitted additional facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $100 million. The Initial Term Loan will mature on August 2, 2029 (the Term Loan Maturity Date). The Initial Term Loan accrues interest at a per annum rate of interest equal to an applicable margin plus, at the Company’s option, either (a) at a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the prime rate published by the Wall Street Journal, (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% and (3) Term SOFR, plus 1.00% or (b) Term SOFR, which, shall be no less than 1.00%. The applicable margin for borrowings of the Initial Term Loan is determined on a quarterly basis by reference to a pricing grid based on the achievement of US Net Sales (as defined in the Financing Agreement) for the most recently completed four consecutive fiscal quarters of the Company and its Subsidiaries (as defined in the Financing Agreement). The pricing grid commences at 5.50% for SOFR borrowings and 4.50% for base rate borrowings and is subject to a 25-basis point step-down upon achievement of a specified US Net Sales threshold. The Initial Term Loan requires scheduled quarterly amortization payments, commencing with the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2028, in an amount equal to $12.5 million, with the balance due and payable on the Term Loan Maturity Date; provided that such amortization payments may be deferred to the Term Loan Maturity Date upon the achievement of a Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Financing Agreement) that is less than or equal to an agreed threshold.

The Initial Term Loan is secured by a lien on substantially all of the assets of the Company and certain subsidiaries of the Company as guarantors and contains customary covenants and representations.

The events of default under the Financing Agreement are customary for financings of this type. If an event of default occurs, the Administrative Agent is entitled to take enforcement action, including acceleration of amounts due under the Financing Agreement.

The Company evaluated whether the Initial Term Loan represented a debt modification or extinguishment of the First Amendment with Hercules with ASC 470-50, Debt – Modifications and Extinguishments. As a result of the Initial Term Loan and effective termination of the First Amendment with Hercules, this transaction was accounted for by the Company under the extinguishment accounting model. The Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $4.6 million in the Company’s statement of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and a prepayment charge. The Company capitalized third party fees from the Initial Term Loan to debt issuance costs and capitalized the facility fee incurred with the Administrative Agent as part of the Initial Term Loan to debt discount.

The Company incurred total financing and upfront costs of $6.0 million related to the Initial Term Loan which are recorded as debt issuance costs and debt discount costs and as an offset to loan payable on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The debt issuance and debt discount costs are being amortized over the term of the debt using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method, and will be included in interest expense in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. Amortization of debt issuance and debt discount costs was $5.6 million (including write off of remaining debt issuance balance under the First Amendment with Hercules), $2.4 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. At December 31, 2024, the remaining unamortized balance of debt issuance and debt discount costs was $5.6 million.

Leases

In October 2014, we entered into an agreement (the Office Agreement) with Fortress Biotech, Inc. (FBIO) to occupy approximately 45% of the 24,000 square feet of New York City office space leased by FBIO. The Office Agreement requires us to pay our respective share of the average annual rent and other costs of the 15-year lease. We approximate an average annual rental obligation of $1.8 million under the Office Agreement. We began to occupy this new space in April 2016, with rental payments beginning in the third quarter of 2016. Also in connection with this lease, we have pledged $1.3 million to secure a line of credit as a security deposit for the Office Agreement, which has been recorded as restricted cash in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Total rental expense was approximately $2.3 million, $2.2 million and $2.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Future minimum lease commitments as of December 31, 2024 total, in the aggregate, approximately $12.6 million through December 31, 2032. Our future minimum lease commitments include our office leases in New York and North Carolina as of December 31, 2024.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

We have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligations under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides us with financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the applicable period. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We define critical accounting policies as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and which may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. In applying these critical accounting policies, our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in making certain estimates. These estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Our critical accounting policies include the following:

Revenue Recognition
. Pursuant to Topic 606, we recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve this core principle, Topic 606 includes provisions within a five-step model that includes i) identifying the contract with a customer, ii) identifying the performance obligations in the contract, iii) determining the transaction price, iv) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations, and v) recognizing revenue when, or as, an entity satisfies a performance obligation.

At contract inception, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and assess whether each promised good or service is distinct and determine those that are performance obligations. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when the performance obligation is satisfied.

Product Revenue, Net – The Company recognizes product revenues, net of variable consideration related to certain allowances and accruals, when the customer takes control of the product, which is typically upon delivery to the customer. Product revenue is recorded at the net sales price, or transaction price. The Company records product revenue reserves, which are classified as a reduction in product revenues, to account for the components of variable consideration. Variable consideration includes the following components, which are described below: chargebacks, government rebates, trade discounts and allowances, product returns, and co-payment assistance.

      87

Table of Contents

These reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if the amount is expected to be settled with a credit against the Company's customer account) or a liability (if the amount is expected to be settled with a cash payment). The Company's estimates of reserves established for variable consideration are calculated based upon a consistent application of the expected value method, which is the sum of probability-weighted amounts in a range of possible consideration amounts. These estimates reflect the Company's current contractual requirements, customer channel mix, changes to product price, government pricing calculations, and industry data. The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price may be subject to constraint and is included in net product revenues only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in a future period. Actual amounts of consideration received may ultimately differ from the Company's estimates. If actual results vary, the Company adjusts these estimates, which could have an effect on earnings in the period of adjustment. For a complete discussion of the accounting for product revenue, see Note 1 – Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

License Revenue - Revenue recognized from license agreements will include royalties on sales, upfront, milestone and other payments, if any, under any current or future licensing agreements, including revenues related to the supply of our drug candidates or approved drugs to our various licensing partners under these types of contracts. For a complete discussion of the accounting for license revenue, see Note 1 – Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Stock Compensation
. Stock-based compensation costs related to equity awards granted to employees and non-employees are measured at the date of grant based on the fair value of the award. We estimate the grant date fair value of options, and the resulting stock-based compensation expense, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Equity awards with market conditions are valued using advanced option-pricing models, such as a Monte Carlo simulation. The effect of a market condition is reflected in the award’s fair value on the grant date. For time-based or performance-based restricted stock, the fair value is based on the market value of our common stock on the date of grant.

Stock-based compensation expense for time-based restricted stock and options is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Stock-based compensation expense for awards that vest upon the achievement of milestones is recognized over the requisite service period when the achievement of such milestones becomes probable. Stock-based compensation expense for an award that has a market condition is recognized over the requisite service period, which is derived from the valuation model, even if the market condition is never satisfied. We recognize all stock-based payments to employees and non-employee directors (as compensation for service) as noncash compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.

Accrued Research and Development Expenses. 
As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments, if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include:

 ​

●

fees paid to contract research organizations (CROs) in connection with clinical studies;

●

fees paid to contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs);

●

fees paid to trial sites in connection with clinical studies; and

●

fees paid to vendors associated with licenses/milestones.

 ​

      88

Table of Contents

We base our expenses related to clinical studies on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple CROs that conduct and manage clinical studies on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to an initial negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the clinical expense. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing certain service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed, enrollment of patients, number of sites activated and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting—Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which improves reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about segment expenses categorized as significant or regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM). The amendments in ASU No. 2023-07 apply to public entities, including those with a single reportable segment, and are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company has evaluated the impact ASU No. 2023-07 on its consolidated financial statements. The Company has adopted this standard as of December 31, 2024 and noted there was no material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. The adoption did result in enhanced disclosures as included in Note 1 -

ITEM

7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK.

The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing our income from investments and minimizing our market risk. We currently invest in government and investment-grade corporate debt in accordance with our investment policy, which we may change from time to time. The securities in which we invest have market risk. This means that a change in prevailing interest rates, and/or credit risk, may cause the fair value of the investment to fluctuate. For example, if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then-prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises, the fair value of our investment will probably decline. As of December 31, 2024, our portfolio of financial instruments consists of cash equivalents and short-term interest-bearing securities, including government debt and money market funds. The average duration of all of our held-to-maturity investments held as of December 31, 2024, was less than 24 months. Due to the relatively short-term nature of these financial instruments, we believe there is no material exposure to interest rate risk, and/or credit risk, arising from our portfolio of financial instruments.

9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
 As of December 31, 2024, management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)). Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

Management
’
s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO Framework. Our management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on these criteria.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 was audited by KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report included herein on page F-3.

Remediation of Material Weakness.
 During the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2024, management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to a process-level control over share-based payment awards that was not designed effectively. This ineffectively designed control was attributable to insufficient risk assessment with regards to non-routine share-based payment awards. Our remediation efforts involved designing and implementing additional preventative controls around non-routine share-based payment awards to ensure the appropriate recognition and measurement of such awards, as well as enhanced risk assessment procedures to ensure that all non-routine share-based payment awards are appropriately identified and evaluated. Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has performed testing to verify the effective design and successful operating effectiveness of the new or enhanced controls and determined that control activities have operated effectively for a sufficient period of time and based upon their evaluations, concluded that the previously disclosed material weakness has been remediated as of December 31, 2024.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
 Except with respect to the remediated material weakness described above, there have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls.
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company have been detected.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
 TG Therapeutics, Inc.:

Opinion on the

Consolidated Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TG Therapeutics, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated March 3, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

      F-1

Estimate of certain product revenue reserves

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records product revenue reserves, which are classified as a reduction in product revenues, to account for the components of variable consideration. Variable consideration includes chargebacks, government rebates, trade discounts and allowances, commercial payer rebates, product returns, and co-payment assistance. These reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable or a liability. The Company's estimates of reserves established for variable consideration are calculated based on the expected value method, which is the sum of probability-weighted amounts in a range of possible consideration amounts. These estimates reflect the Company's current contractual requirements, customer channel mix, changes to product price, government pricing calculations, and industry data.

We identified the estimate of product revenue reserves related to co-payment assistance rebates and government rebates for Medicaid as a critical audit matter. The evaluation of these reserves involved especially challenging auditor judgment due to measurement uncertainty and limited historical data. The reserves are calculated by estimating which of the Company’s product revenue transactions will ultimately be subject to a related rebate and the amount of such rebate. There was limited historical data available for the Company to use in its determination of these key assumptions as the Company’s only product, BRIUMVI, was launched commercially in January 2023.

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s product revenue reserves process, including controls over determination of the key assumptions noted above. We evaluated the reserves related to co-payment assistance rebates and Medicaid rebates by developing an independent expectation based on external and internal information and comparing the result to the Company’s estimated reserves. For a sample of claims related to co-payment assistance rebates and Medicaid rebates, we inspected underlying documentation and related disbursements made by the Company.

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

 ​

We have audited TG Therapeutics, Inc. and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated March 3, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 ​

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

TG Therapeutics is a fully-integrated, commercial stage, biopharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of novel treatments for B-cell mediated diseases. TG has received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for BRIUMVI® (ublituximab-xiiy) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS), to include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease and active secondary progressive disease, in adults, as well as approval by the European Commission (EC) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for BRIUMVI to treat adult patients with RMS who have active disease defined by clinical or imaging features in Europe and the United Kingdom (UK), respectively. We also actively evaluate complementary products, technologies and companies for in-licensing, partnership, acquisition and/or investment opportunities.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Historically, we have incurred operating losses since our inception; however, during the years ended 
 December 31, 2024, 
and 
 December 31, 2023 
the Company generated net income. During the years ended 
 December 31, 2023, 
the Company experienced a net profit due to a $
140.0
 million non-refundable upfront payment recognized as license revenue in the 
third
 quarter of 
2023
 as part of our Commercialization Agreement with Neuraxpharm (see Note 
2
 for more information). While we have recently generated net income, we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception, and we 
 may 
incur losses in the future. As of 
 December 31, 2024, 
we have an accumulated deficit of $
1.5
 billion.

Our major sources of cash have been proceeds from private placements and public offerings of equity securities, from our loan and security agreements, the upfront payment from the Commercialization Agreement (see Note 
2
 for more information), and from product revenue from drug sales of BRIUMVI. Substantially all our operating losses have resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from selling, general and administrative costs associated with our operations, including our commercialization activities. For the year ended 
 December 31, 2024, 
we generated $
313.7
 million in product revenue from drug sales of BRIUMVI. BRIUMVI 
first
 became commercially available in the United States in 
 January 
of 
2023.
 We also began shipping BRIUMVI to our ex-U.S. licensing partner, Neuraxpharm, in 
 November 2023. 
Even with the commercialization of BRIUMVI and the possible future commercialization of our other drug candidates, we 
 may 
not
 realize continued profitability. Our ability to achieve continued profitability depends on our ability to generate revenue and many other factors, including our ability to successfully commercialize our drug candidates alone or in partnership; successfully complete any post-approval regulatory obligations; and our ability to maintain or obtain regulatory approval for our drug candidates. We 
 may 
incur operating losses even now that we are generating revenues from BRIUMVI. 

As of 
 December 31, 2024
, we had $
311.0
 million in cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investment securities. We anticipate that our cash, cash equivalents, and investment securities as of 
 December 31, 2024, 
combined with projected revenues associated with the sale of BRIUMVI in the U.S. and ex-U.S.,  will provide sufficient liquidity for more than a 
twelve
-month period from the date of filing this Annual Report on Form 
10
-K. The actual amount of cash that we will need to operate is subject to many factors, including, but 
not
 limited to, our commercialization efforts for BRIUMVI and the timing, design and conduct of clinical trials for our drug candidates as well as the costs associated with licensing or otherwise acquiring new product candidates. We 
 may 
be dependent upon significant future financing to provide the cash necessary to execute our ongoing and future operations, including the commercialization of any of our drug candidates.

Our common stock is quoted on the Nasdaq Capital Market and trades under the symbol “TGTX.”

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

Management does 
not
 believe that any recently issued, but 
not
 yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.

        Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the applicable reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue, accrued clinical trial expenses and stock-based compensation. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Such differences could be material to the financial statements.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

We treat liquid investments with original maturities of less than 
three
 months when purchased as cash and cash equivalents.

RESTRICTED CASH

We record cash pledged or held in trust as restricted cash. As of 
 December 31, 2024 
and 
2023
, we have approximately $
1.3
 million of restricted cash pledged to secure a line of credit as a security deposit for an Office Agreement (see Note 
7
).

INVESTMENT SECURITIES

Investment securities at 
 December 31, 2024 
and 
2023
 consist of short-term government securities. We classify these securities as held-to-maturity. Held-to-maturity securities are those securities in which we have the ability and intent to hold the security until maturity. Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost, adjusted for the amortization or accretion of premiums or discounts. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related held-to-maturity security as an adjustment to yield using the effective interest method.

A decline in the market value of any investment security below cost that is deemed to be other than temporary, results in a reduction in the carrying amount to fair value. The impairment is charged to operations and a new cost basis for the security is established. Other-than-temporary impairment charges are included in interest and other income (expense), net. Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned.

Our equity securities consist of common stock of Precision BioSciences, Inc. (Precision). Equity securities are recognized at their fair value in accordance with ASC 
321,
 Investments – Equity Securities. Forward contracts to purchase equity securities that do 
not
 qualify as derivatives under ASC 
815
 are accounted for in accordance with ASC 
321.
 These forward contracts are recorded at fair value at the balance sheet date. See Note 
5
 for further details.

CREDIT RISK

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments with high-credit quality financial institutions. At times, such amounts 
 may 
exceed federally-insured limits.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

Pursuant to Topic 
606,
 we recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve this core principle, Topic 
606
 includes provisions within a 
five
-step model that includes i) identifying the contract with a customer, ii) identifying the performance obligations in the contract, iii) determining the transaction price, iv) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations, and v) recognizing revenue when, or as, an entity satisfies a performance obligation.

At contract inception, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and assess whether each promised good or service is distinct and determine those that are performance obligations. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when the performance obligation is satisfied.

        Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Product Revenue, Net
 – The Company recognizes product revenues, net of variable consideration related to certain allowances and accruals, when the customer takes control of the product, which is typically upon delivery to the customer. Product revenue is recorded at the net sales price, or transaction price. The Company records product revenue reserves, which are classified as a reduction in product revenues, to account for the components of variable consideration. Variable consideration includes the following components, which are described below: chargebacks, government rebates, trade discounts and allowances, commercial payer rebates, product returns, and co-payment assistance.

These reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if the amount is expected to be settled with a credit against the Company's customer account) or a liability (if the amount is expected to be settled with a cash payment). The Company's estimates of reserves established for variable consideration are calculated based upon a consistent application of the expected value method, which is the sum of probability-weighted amounts in a range of possible consideration amounts. These estimates reflect the Company's current contractual requirements,  customer channel mix, changes to product price, government pricing calculations and industry data. The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price 
 may 
be subject to constraint and is included in net product revenues only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will 
not
 occur in a future period. Actual amounts of consideration received 
 may 
ultimately differ from the Company's estimates. If actual results vary, the Company adjusts these estimates, which could have an effect on earnings in the period of adjustment.

Chargebacks: Chargebacks for discounts represent the Company’s estimated obligations resulting from contractual commitments to sell product to qualified healthcare providers and government agencies at prices lower than the list prices charged to the customers who directly purchase the product from the Company. The customers charge the Company for the difference between what the customers pay the Company for the product and the customers’ ultimate contractually committed or government required lower selling price to the qualified healthcare providers.

Government Rebates: Government rebates consist of Medicare, Tricare, and Medicaid rebates. These reserves are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized. For Medicare, the Company also estimates the number of patients in the prescription drug coverage gap for whom it will owe a rebate under the Medicare Part D program.

Trade Discounts and Allowances: The Company provides its customers with discounts that are explicitly stated in the contracts and are recorded in the period the related product revenue is recognized. In addition, the Company also receives sales order management, inventory management, and data services from its customers in exchange for certain fees.

Commercial Payer Rebates: The Company contracts with various private payer organizations, primarily insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers, for the payment of rebates with respect to utilization of our product and contracted formulary status. The Company estimates these rebates and records such estimates in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a current liability.

Product Returns: Consistent with industry practice, the Company generally offers customers a limited right of return for product that has been purchased from the Company. The Company estimates the amount of its product sales that 
 may 
be returned by its customers and records this estimate in the period the related product revenue is recognized. The Company currently estimates product return liabilities based on data from similar products and other qualitative considerations, such as visibility into the inventory remaining in the distribution channel.

Subject to certain limitations, the Company’s return policy allows for eligible returns of commercial products sold for credit under the following circumstances:

●

receipt of damaged product;

●

shipment errors that were a result of an error by the Company;

●

expired product that is returned during the period beginning 
three
 months prior to the product’s expiration and ending 
six
 months after the expiration date;

●

product subject to a recall; and

●

product that the Company, at its sole discretion, has specified can be returned for credit.

As of 
 December 31, 2024
, the Company has $
0.1
 million in returns related to sales of BRIUMVI.

 ​

Co-Payment Assistance Programs: Co-payment assistance is provided to qualified patients with commercial insurance, whereby the Company 
 may 
provide financial assistance to patients with prescription drug co-payments required by the patient's insurance provider. Reserves for co-payment assistance are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized.

License Agreements 
–

The Company generates revenue from license or similar agreements with pharmaceutical companies for the development and commercialization of certain products. Such agreements 
 may
 include the transfer of intellectual property rights in the form of licenses. Payments made by the customer 
 may
 include non-refundable upfront fees, payments based upon the achievement of defined milestones, and royalties on sales of products.

Licenses of intellectual property
: If a license to the Company’s intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, the Company recognizes the transaction price allocated to the license as revenue upon transfer of control of the license. All other promised goods or services in the agreement are evaluated to determine if they are distinct. If they are 
not
 distinct, they are combined with other promised goods or services to create a bundle of promised goods or services that is distinct.

Milestone payments
: Contingent milestones at contract inception are estimated at the amount which is 
not
 probable of a material reversal and included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. Milestone payments that are 
not
 within the Company's control, such as regulatory approvals, are 
not
 considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received and therefore the variable consideration is constrained. The transaction price is then allocated to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, for which the Company recognizes revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied. At the end of each reporting period, the Company re-evaluates the probability of achieving development or sales-based milestone payments that 
 may

not
 be subject to a material reversal and, if necessary, adjust the estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect license and other revenue, as well as earnings, in the period of adjustment.

Sales-based royalties
: For arrangements that include sales-based royalties and a license of intellectual property that is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, revenue is recognized at the later of when the related sales occur or when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalties have been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied).

Optional Purchases
: The Company’s arrangements 
 may 
provide the licensee the right to make optional purchases of the licensed product. These optional purchases are accounted for as separate contracts when the licensee determines that it will make such a purchase, unless the option conveys a material right.

Other Revenue 

Revenue is also generated from service-based fees recognized for providing regulatory support and development services to customers. Service fee revenue is recognized overtime as the services are transferred to the customer.

DEFERRED PRODUCT REVENUE

When consideration is received, or such consideration is unconditionally due, from a customer prior to the Company completing its performance obligation to the customer under the terms of a contract, a contract liability is recorded as deferred revenue. Deferred revenues expected to be recognized as revenue within the 
12
 months following the balance sheet date are classified as current liabilities. Deferred revenues 
not
 expected to be recognized as revenue within the 
12
 months following the balance sheet date are classified as long-term liabilities.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

In general, accounts receivable consists of amounts due from customers, net of customer allowances for cash discounts, product returns and chargebacks. Our contracts with customers have standard payment terms. We analyze accounts that are past due for collectability, and regularly evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers so that we can properly assess and respond to changes in their credit profiles. As of 
 December 31, 2024
, we determined an allowance for expected credit losses related to outstanding accounts receivable was currently 
not
 required based upon our review of contractual payment terms and individual customer circumstances.

COST OF REVENUE

Cost of revenue consists primarily of 
third
-party manufacturing costs, distribution, overhead and royalties owed to our licensing partner for BRIUMVI sales. Cost of revenue 
 may 
also include costs related to excess or obsolete inventory adjustment charges, abnormal costs, unabsorbed manufacturing and overhead costs, and manufacturing variances. Based on our policy to expense costs associated with the manufacture of our products prior to regulatory approval, a portion of the costs of producing BRIUMVI sold to date was expensed as research and development prior to FDA approval of BRIUMVI and therefore it is 
not
 reflected in the cost of revenue. Our cost of revenue also relates to providing regulatory support & development services to customers.

INVENTORY

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value with cost based on the 
first
-in-
first
-out method (FIFO). We classify inventory costs as long-term, in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets, when we expect to utilize the inventory beyond our normal operating cycle.  Prior to regulatory approval, we expense costs relating to the production of inventory as research and development expense in the period incurred. Following regulatory approval, costs to manufacture those approved products will be capitalized. Inventory that can be used in either the production of clinical or commercial products is expensed as research and development costs when identified for use in clinical trials.

Prior to the approval of BRIUMVI, all manufacturing and other potential costs related to the commercial launch of BRIUMVI were expensed to research and development expense in the period incurred.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS

Generally, research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred to 
third
-party service providers for the conduct of research, preclinical and clinical studies, contract manufacturing costs, license milestone fees, personnel costs for our research and development employees, consulting, and other related expenses. We recognize research, preclinical and clinical study expenses based on services performed, pursuant to contracts with 
third
-party research and development organizations that conduct and manage research, preclinical and clinical activities on our behalf. We accrue these expenses based on the progress or stage of completion of services and the contracted fees to be paid for such services. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the original accrual, we will adjust the accrual accordingly. With respect to clinical trial costs, the financial terms of these agreements are subject to an initial negotiation and vary from contract to contract. Payments under these contracts 
 may 
be uneven and depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events, the successful recruitment of patients, the completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions. As such, certain expense accruals related to clinical site costs are recognized based on the degree of performance of the event or events specified in the specific clinical study or trial contract.

INCOME TAXES

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date. If the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets or liability is less than “more likely than 
not,”
 a valuation allowance is then created.

We, and our subsidiaries, file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in various states. We have tax net operating loss carryforwards that are subject to examination for a number of years beyond the year in which they were generated for tax purposes. Since a portion of these net operating loss carryforwards 
 may 
be utilized in the future, many of these net operating loss carryforwards will remain subject to examination. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions in income tax expense. Refer to Note 
9
 for further information.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

Stock-based compensation costs related to equity awards granted to employees and non-employees are measured at the date of grant based on the fair value of the award. We estimate the grant date fair value of options, and the resulting stock-based compensation expense, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Equity awards with market conditions are valued using advanced option-pricing models, such as a Monte Carlo simulation. The effect of a market condition is reflected in the award’s fair value on the grant date. For time-based or performance-based restricted stock, the fair value is based on the market value of our common stock on the date of grant.

Stock-based compensation expense for time-based restricted stock and options is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Stock-based compensation expense for awards that vest upon the achievement of milestones is recognized over the requisite service period when the achievement of such milestones becomes probable. Stock-based compensation expense for an award that has a market condition is recognized over the requisite service period, which is derived from the valuation model, even if the market condition is never satisfied. We recognize all stock-based payments to employees and non-employee directors (as compensation for service) as noncash compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.

SHARES REPURCHASE 

The Company repurchases shares through open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions, block purchases or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including Rule 
10b
-
18
 of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934,
 as amended (the Exchange Act). We account for shares repurchased under the treasury accounting method (ASC 
505
-
30
). We recognize the amount paid to repurchase the shares as a reduction of stockholders’ equity and include treasury stock on a separate line item in the equity section of our consolidated balance sheet. Treasury stock is excluded from shares outstanding.

NET INCOME (LOSS) PER COMMON SHARE

Basic net income (loss) per share of our common stock is calculated by dividing net income (loss) applicable to the common stock by the weighted-average number of our common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share of common stock includes the effect, if any, from the potential exercise or conversion of securities, such as warrants, stock options, and restricted stock, which would result in the issuance of incremental shares of common stock. The impact of these items is anti-dilutive during periods of net loss, therefore, basic and diluted net loss per share were the same for the year ended 
 December 31, 2022 
in the consolidated statement of operations as a result of the Company’s net loss during the year ended 
 December 31, 2022. 
During the years

ended 
 December 31, 2024 
and

the Company had net income and as such presents the dilutive effect of potential common shares in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share in the table below.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND GOODWILL

Long-lived assets are reviewed for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of long-lived tangible and intangible assets with finite lives 
 may 
not
 be recoverable. Management’s policy in determining whether an impairment indicator exists, a triggering event, comprises measurable operating performance criteria as well as qualitative measures. If an analysis is necessitated by the occurrence of a triggering event, we make certain assumptions in determining the impairment amount. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized.

Goodwill results from excess consideration in a business combination over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is 
not
 amortized but is reviewed for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present, by 
first
 assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than 
not
 that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If we conclude it is more likely than 
not
 that the fair value is less than the carrying amount, a quantitative test that compares the fair value to its carrying value is performed to determine the amount of any impairment.

LEASES

All leases with a lease term greater than 
12
 months, regardless of lease type classification, are recorded as an obligation on the balance sheet with a corresponding right-of-use asset. Operating leases are reflected as lease liabilities on the commencement date of the lease based on the present value of the lease payments to be made over the lease term. Current operating lease liabilities are reflected in lease liabilities – current portion and noncurrent operating lease liabilities are reflected in lease liabilities – non-current on the consolidated balance sheet. Right-of-use assets are valued at the initial measurement of the lease liability, plus any initial direct costs or rent prepayments, minus lease incentives and any deferred lease payments. Operating lease assets are recorded to right of use assets on the consolidated balance sheet and lease cost is recognized on a straight-line basis. Leases with an initial term of 
12
 months or less are 
not
 recorded on the balance sheet and we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. In determining whether a contract contains a lease, asset and service agreements are assessed at onset and upon modification for criteria of specifically identified assets, control and economic benefit.

SEGMENT REPORTING

Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise that engage in business activities from which it 
 may 
recognize revenues and incur expenses, and for which discrete financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) to allocate resources and assess performance.

The Company operates in 
one
 reportable segment, B-cell mediated disease therapy, which includes all activities related to the development and commercialization of novel treatments, including BRIUMVI, to address unmet medical needs and improve the lives of patients. The determination of a single reportable segment is consistent with the consolidated financial information regularly provided to the Company’s chief operating decision maker (CODM), which is its chief executive officer, who reviews and evaluates consolidated net income (loss) for purposes of assessing performance, making operating decisions, allocating resources and planning and forecasting for future periods. The measure of segment assets is reported on the balance sheet as total assets.

IMMATERIAL CORRECTIONS OF PRIOR PERIOD FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

During 
 July 
of 
2024,
 the Company identified an error related to the expense recognition of a single restricted stock award granted in 
2021.
 The impact of the error was an understatement of non-cash compensation expense (SG&A) in the years ended 
 December 31, 2021 
and 
2022
 and a corresponding understatement of additional paid in capital (APIC). The Company concluded the error did 
not
 result in a material misstatement of the Company’s previously issued consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, the Company corrected the relevant consolidated financial statements and related footnotes for the year ended 
 December 
31,

2022
 within these consolidated financial statements.

License Agreements

Neuraxpharm Commercialization Agreement

On 
 July 28, 2023, 
the Company entered into the Commercialization Agreement with Neuraxpharm. The Company granted Neuraxpharm the exclusive right to commercialize BRIUMVI in certain territories outside the United States, Canada, and Mexico, the commercialization rights for which had been previously retained by the Company, and excluding certain Asian countries subject to previously existing partnerships (the Territory). In addition, the Company will perform certain development and regulatory activities for Neuraxpharm to support its obligations under the Commercialization Agreement to secure and maintain the regulatory approvals required to sell BRIUMVI in the Territory. As part of the overall arrangement, the Company has agreed to supply BRIUMVI to Neuraxpharm throughout the term of the Commercialization Agreement.

In consideration for entering the Commercialization Agreement, the Company received a non-refundable upfront payment of $
140.0
 million. The Company will also receive tiered double-digit royalties up to 
30
% on net product sales in the Territory and is eligible to receive sales-based or other milestone payments totaling up to $
505.0
 million. 

The Company evaluated the Commercialization Agreement under ASC 
606
 and concluded that Neuraxpharm represents a customer in the transaction. In accordance with this guidance, the Company identified the following commitments under the arrangement: (i) grant the exclusive right to develop, sell, offer to sell and import BRIUMVI in the Territory (the “License”); and (ii) perform certain development and regulatory activities (“Development and Regulatory Activities”).

The License to the Company’s intellectual property represents a distinct performance obligation, therefore, the $
140.0
 million non-refundable upfront payment related to this performance obligation was recognized as License Revenue in 
2023.

The Development and Regulatory Activities also represent a distinct performance obligation and are satisfied over time because Neuraxpharm simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Company’s performance of the services. Therefore, revenue is recognized as the activities are completed by the Company.  During 
2024
 the Company recognized Other Revenue of $
1.8
 million related to the Development and Regulatory Activities.

The arrangement also provides Neuraxpharm with the right to make optional purchases of BRIUMVI (the “Supply of Licensed Product”). These optional purchases are accounted for as a separate contract when the right to purchase BRIUMVI is exercised. The consideration for optional purchases of BRIUMVI by Neuraxpharm approximates the price that a customer in the Territory would be willing to pay for these goods.

The performance obligation related to the Supply of Licensed Product is satisfied when control of the product passes to Neuraxpharm. The consideration received from Neuraxpharm for the supply of BRIUMVI is recognized by the Company as a component of product revenue, net. As of 
 December 31, 2024, 
the Company has an unconditional right to receive $
1.5
 million in consideration from Neuraxpharm related to the performance obligation to supply BRIUMVI, which is recorded as accounts receivable, net. A portion of the performance obligation to supply BRIUMVI has 
not
 yet been satisfied, therefore, as of 
 December 31, 2024, 
$
23.5
 million has been recorded as deferred revenue. During 
2024
 the Company recognized $
3.7
 million in BRIUMVI product sales, net related to performance obligations that were satisfied during the year ended 
 December 31, 2024. 
The Company will reevaluate the consideration received, and performance obligations satisfied at the end of each reporting period. Such reevaluations 
 may 
result in a change to the amount of product revenue, net, recognized and deferred revenue.

The remaining forms of consideration are variable because they are dependent on the achievement of sales-based or other milestones. The Company evaluated the constraint on variable consideration and concluded that the milestone payments are highly dependent on factors outside of the Company’s control. Therefore, at contract inception, the milestones are 
not
 included in the transaction price as it is 
not
 probable that a significant reversal of revenue would 
not
 occur. Sales-based milestones will be recognized as revenue in the period when the related sales threshold is met. All other milestones will be recognized as revenue immediately in the period the achievement of the underlying milestone is probable. In 
2024,
 the Company received a $
12.5
 million milestone payment for the 
first
 key market commercial launch of BRIUMVI in the EU. Any consideration related to sales-based royalties will be recognized when the related sales occur. For the period ended 
 December 31, 2024, 
the Company recognized royalty revenue of $
0.8
 million.

Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and consists of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods. Cost is determined using a standard cost method, which approximates actual cost, and assumes a FIFO flow of goods. Inventory that is used for clinical development purposes is expensed to research and development expense when consumed.

At 
 December 
31,2024,
 all our inventory was solely related to BRIUMVI, which was approved by the FDA on 
 December 28, 2022, 
at which time we began to capitalize costs to manufacture BRIUMVI. Prior to FDA approval of BRIUMVI, all costs related to the manufacturing of BRIUMVI and related material were charged to research and development expense in the period incurred.

The work in process materials consist primarily of bulk drug substance, which has a multi-year shelf life.  When the bulk drug substance is manufactured into BRIUMVI finished goods, those finished goods have a shelf life of 
three
 years from the date of manufacture.  Our expectation is to sell finished goods at least 
twelve
 months prior to expiration. Due to our long manufacturing lead time, it was necessary to buildup inventory in support of BRIUMVI forecasted sales, to ensure appropriate safety stock levels, and meet our commitment to supply BRIUMVI to Neuraxpharm related to the Commercialization Agreement. As a result of BRIUMVI being in the early stages of commercial launch, we continue to evaluate the length of our normal operating cycle. 

On a quarterly basis, the Company analyzes our inventory levels for excess quantities and obsolescence (expiration), taking into account factors such as historical and anticipated future sales compared to quantities on hand and the remaining shelf-life. At 
 December 31, 2024, 
we determined that a reserve related to BRIUMVI inventory for excess quantities and obsolescence   is 
not
 required. In addition, since FDA approval of BRIUMVI, the Company has 
not
 recorded any inventory write downs.

 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

We measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis in the financial statements. The fair value hierarchy ranks the quality and reliability of inputs, or assumptions, used in the determination of fair value and requires financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value to be classified and disclosed in 
one
 of the following 
three
 categories:

●

Level 
1
 – quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;

●

Level 
2
 – inputs other than Level 
1
 quoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable; and

●

Level 
3
 – unobservable inputs that are 
not
 corroborated by market data.

Equity Investments and Forward Contract Liabilities

On 
 January 7, 2024, (
the Precision Effective Date) the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, TG Cell Therapy, Inc., (TG Cell) entered into a License Agreement (the Precision License Agreement) with Precision, pursuant to which Precision granted the Company certain exclusive and non-exclusive license rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize Precision’s allogeneic CAR T therapy azercabtagene zapreleucel (azer-cel) for the treatment of autoimmune and other non-oncology diseases and conditions.

Pursuant to the Precision License Agreement, the Company made an upfront payment to Precision of $
7.5
 million, consisting of (i) $
5.25
 million in cash and (ii) $
2.25
 million (the Upfront Precision Stock Payment), as an equity investment, for the purchase of 
2,920,816
 shares of Precision’s common stock at a price of $
0.77
 per share. The Company paid a premium for the shares which was recorded in research and development expense as part of the cost of the Precision License Agreement. Precision subsequently had a 
30
-to-
1
 reverse stock split in 
 February 2024. 
The shares purchased with the Upfront Precision Stock Payment are classified as an equity investment and are recognized at fair market value as of 
 December 31, 2024.

Within 
12
 months following the Precision Effective Date, the Company will make a 
one
-time payment to Precision equal to $
2.5
 million (the Deferred Precision Stock Payment). Upon receipt of such payment, Precision shall issue to the Company the number of shares of Precision common stock (the Precision Shares) (rounded down to the nearest whole share) obtained by dividing the Deferred Precision Stock Payment by 
200
% of the weighted average share price of the Precision common stock (the Precision Share Price) for the 
thirty
 (
30
) trading days preceding the date on which Precision receives the payment. The Deferred Precision Stock Payment was recorded to research and development License Fees as part of the cost of the Precision License Agreement, and is classified as a forward contract liability recognized at fair market value in Other Current Liabilities as of 
 December 31, 2024, 
in accordance with ASC 
321.

Upon the achievement of a clinical and regulatory milestone event (Milestone Event 
1
), the Company will make a 
one
-time payment to Precision equal to $
2.3
 million (the Milestone 
1
 Precision Stock Payment). Upon receipt of such payment, Precision shall issue to the Company the Precision Shares (rounded down to the nearest whole share) obtained by dividing the Milestone 
1
 Precision Stock Payment by 
200
% of the weighted average share price of the Precision common stock (the Precision Share Price) for the 
thirty
 (
30
) trading days preceding the achievement of Milestone Event 
1.
 The Milestone 
1
 Precision Stock Payment was recorded to research and development License Fees as part of the cost of the Precision License Agreement, and is classified as a forward contract liability recognized at fair market value in Other Current Liabilities as of 
 December 31, 2024, 
in accordance with ASC 
321.

Equity Incentive Plans

The TG Therapeutics, Inc. Amended and Restated 
2012
 Incentive Plan (the 
2012
 Incentive Plan) was approved by stockholders in 
 June 
2020.
 As of 
 December 31, 2024, 
3,803,752
 shares of restricted stock and 
2,202,716
 options were outstanding, and 
no
 additional shares were available to be issued under the 
2012
 Incentive Plan.

The TG Therapeutics, Inc. 
2022
 Incentive Plan (the 
2022
 Incentive Plan) was approved by stockholders in 
 June 2022 
with 
17,000,000
  shares available to be issued. As of 
 December 31, 2024, 
8,039,834
 shares of restricted stock and 
2,267,500
 options were outstanding, and up to an additional 
4,238,185
 shares were available to be issued under the 
2022
 Incentive Plan.

During 
 July 
of 
2024,
 the Company identified an error related to the expense recognition of a single restricted stock award granted in 
2021.
 The impact of the error was an understatement of non-cash compensation expense (SG&A) in the years ended 
 December 31, 2022, 
and 
2021
 and a corresponding understatement of additional paid in capital (APIC). The Company has concluded the error did 
not
 result in a material misstatement of the Company’s previously issued consolidated financial statements. The cumulative impact of the error has been corrected as an immaterial correction of the 
 December 31, 2023 
consolidated balance sheet by increasing accumulated deficit and APIC by approximately $
38.2
 million. In addition, the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended 
 December 31, 2022 
has been revised to reflect the immaterial correction by increasing noncash compensation (selling, general and administrative) by $
25.5
 million and basic and diluted net loss per common share increased from ($
1.46
) to ($
1.65
).

Total stock-based compensation expense included in the consolidated statements of operations was $
42.5
 million, $
37.9
 million and $
44.6
 million during the years ended 
 December 31, 2024, 
2023
 and 
2022,
 respectively. The $
42.5
 million and $
37.9
 million are net of $
3.8
 million and $
2.9
 million of stock-based compensation expense that was capitalized into inventory during the year ended 
 December 31, 2024

2023,

Milestone-based noncash compensation expense will be measured and recorded if and when a milestone becomes probable.  Equity awards with market conditions are valued using advanced option-pricing models, such as a Monte Carlo simulation. The effect of a market condition is reflected in the award’s fair value on the grant date. Stock-based compensation expense for an award that has a market condition is recognized over the requisite service period derived from the award valuation on the grant date, even if the market condition is never satisfied. As of 
 December 31, 2024, 
there was approximately $
22.0
 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested milestone-based restricted stock. As of 
 December 31, 2024, 
there was approximately $
29.1
 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to restricted stock with market conditions, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 
3.5
 years.

Warrants

The Company’s only outstanding warrants are warrants issued to Hercules as part of the prior loan agreements to purchase 
115,042
 and 
50,172
 shares of our common stock with exercise prices of $
17.95
 and $
14.70
, respectively. During the year ended

Hercules exercised a portion of their outstanding warrants from a prior loan agreement to purchase 
147,058
 shares via cashless exercise. The First Amendment (as defined below) also contains warrant coverage of 
2.95
% of each advance amount funded. A warrant was issued by the Company to Hercules to purchase 
50,172
 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $
14.70
 (the First Amendment Warrant). The First Amendment Warrant shall be exercisable for 
seven
 years from the date of issuance. Hercules 
 may

exercise the First Amendment Warrant either by (a) cash or check or (b) through a net issuance conversion. There will 
not
 be any ongoing stock compensation expense associated with these warrants.

Common Stock

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 
190,000,000
 shares of $
0.001
 par value common stock.

On 
 September 2, 2022, 
we filed an automatic “shelf registration” statement on Form S-
3
 (the 
2022
 WKSI Shelf) as a “well-known seasoned issuer” as defined in Rule 
405
 under the Securities Act, which registered an unlimited and indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future issuance and sale. The 
2022
 WKSI Shelf was declared effective in 
 September 2022. 
In connection with the 
2022
 WKSI Shelf, we entered into an At-the-Market Issuance Sales Agreement (the 
2022
 ATM) with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. and B. Riley Securities, Inc. (each a 
2022
 Agent and collectively, the 
2022
 Agents), relating to the sale of shares of our common stock. Under the 
2022
 ATM, we will pay the 
2022
 Agents a commission rate of up to 
3.0
% of the gross proceeds from the sale of any shares of common stock. 

During the year ended 
 December 31, 2023, 
we sold a total of 
1,385,700
 shares of common stock under the 
2022
 ATM for aggregate total gross proceeds of approximately $
47.1
 million at an average selling price of $
34.01
 per share, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $
46.3
 million after deducting commissions and other transactions costs. We had 
no
 activity on the 
2022
 ATM during the year ended 
 December 31, 2024. 
The 
2022
 WKSI Shelf is currently our only active shelf-registration statement. We 
 may 
offer any combination of the securities registered under the 
2022
 WKSI Shelf from time to time in response to market conditions or other circumstances if we believe such a plan of financing is in the best interests of our stockholders. We 
 may 
need to file additional shelf-registration statements in the future to provide us with the flexibility to raise additional capital to finance our operations as needed. 

Share Repurchase Program and Treasury Stock

On 
 August 2, 2024, 
the Company announced that its Board of Directors (the Board) had authorized and approved a share repurchase program for up to $
100
 million of the currently outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock.  Under the share repurchase program, the Company intends to repurchase shares through open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions, block purchases or other methods in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including Rule 
10b
-
18
 of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934,
 as amended (the Exchange Act). For the year ended 
 December 31, 2024, 
the Company repurchased 
326,594
 shares of common stock at a cost of $
8.8
 million. As of 
 December 31, 2024, 
367,903
 shares of common stock are being held in Treasury, at a cost of approximately $
9.0
 million, representing the fair market value on the date the shares were surrendered to the Company, mainly as part of our share repurchase program.

 LOAN PAYABLE

On 
 March 31, 2023 (
the First Amendment Effective Date), the Company entered into a First Amendment to the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the First Amendment) with Hercules Capital, Inc. (Hercules). The First Amendment amended the terms of the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (Amended Loan Agreement) with Hercules that closed on 
 December 30, 2021. 
The First Amendment amended the terms of the Amended Loan Agreement to, among other things: (i) issue an advance of $
25.0
 million drawn at the First Amendment Effective Date (the Tranche 
3A
 Advance), (ii) provide for the formal expiration of Tranche 
2,
 (iii) change the draw amounts and dates available under subsequent tranches, including splitting the remaining balance of Tranche 
3
 into 
two
 additional advances in an aggregate principal amount of up to $
20.0
 million, in increments of $
10.0
 million (a Tranche 
3B
 Advance and a Tranche 
3C
 Advance), decreasing the amount available under Tranche 
4
 from $
65.0
 million to $
60.0
 million, and adding a Tranche 
5
 of $
25.0
 million, subject to the achievement of revenue related performance milestones, (iv) extend the interest only period from 
 February 1, 2025 
to 
 August 1, 2025 
and (v) modify the cash interest rate to be the greater of either (a) the “prime rate” as reported in The Wall Street Journal plus 
1.20
%, and (b) 
8.95
%. In addition to the cash interest rate, the principal balance will accrue paid-in-kind interest at a rate of 
2.25
%, which amount will be capitalized and added to the outstanding principal balance of the Amended Term Loan and payable at the maturity date of the Amended Loan Agreement, as amended. The Amended Loan agreement, as amended, contains financial covenants that require the Company to maintain certain levels of unrestricted cash and additional financial covenants related to market capitalization.

The First Amendment also contains warrant coverage of 
2.95
% of each advance amount funded. A warrant (the Warrant) was issued by the Company to Hercules to purchase 
115,042
 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $
17.95
 for the initial amount funded at the Closing Date. The Warrant shall be exercisable for 
seven
 years from the date of issuance. Hercules 
 may 
exercise the Warrant either by (a) cash or check or (b) through a net issuance conversion. Additionally, a warrant was issued by the Company to Hercules to purchase 
50,172
 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $
14.70
 for the amount funded pertaining to the Tranche 
3A
 Advance (the First Amendment Warrant). The First Amendment Warrant shall be exercisable for 
seven
 years from the date of issuance. Hercules 
 may 
exercise the First Amendment Warrant either by (a) cash or check or (b) through a net issuance conversion.

        Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

On 
 August 2, 2024 (
the New Closing Date), the Company entered into a term loan facility of $
250
 million (the Initial Term Loan) with Blue Owl Capital Corporation, as administrative agent (the Administrative Agent), HealthCare Royalty and Blue Owl Capital under the Financing Agreement (as defined below). The Company repaid all outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees under the First Amendment with Hercules (such repayment, the Refinancing), which Refinancing was funded with the proceeds of the Initial Term Loan. The existing Amended Loan Agreement with Hercules was effectively terminated, and all guarantees and liens granted thereunder were released upon the consummation of the Refinancing.

The Initial Term Loan is governed by a financing agreement, dated as of the New Closing Date (the Financing Agreement), which provides for (i) a single draw of the Initial Term Loan on the New Closing Date and (ii) an uncommitted additional facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $
100
 million. The Initial Term Loan will mature on 
 August 2, 2029 (
the Term Loan Maturity Date). The Initial Term Loan accrues interest at a per annum rate of interest equal to an applicable margin plus, at the Company’s option, either (a) at a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (
1
) the prime rate published by the Wall Street Journal, (
2
) the federal funds effective rate plus 
0.50
% and (
3
) Term SOFR, plus 
1.00
% or (b) Term SOFR, which, shall be 
no
 less than 
1.00
%. The applicable margin for borrowings of the Initial Term Loan is determined on a quarterly basis by reference to a pricing grid based on the achievement of US Net Sales (as defined in the Financing Agreement) for the most recently completed 
four
 consecutive fiscal quarters of the Company and its Subsidiaries (as defined in the Financing Agreement). The pricing grid commences at 
5.50
% for SOFR borrowings and 
4.50
% for base rate borrowings and is subject to a 
25
 basis point step-down upon achievement of a specified US Net Sales threshold. The Initial Term Loan requires scheduled quarterly amortization payments, commencing with the fiscal quarter ending 
 June 30, 2028, 
in an amount equal to $
12.5
 million, with the balance due and payable on the Term Loan Maturity Date; provided that such amortization payments 
 may 
be deferred to the Term Loan Maturity Date upon the achievement of a Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Financing Agreement) that is less than or equal to an agreed threshold.

The Initial Term Loan is secured by a lien on substantially all of the assets of the Company and certain subsidiaries of the Company as guarantors and contains customary covenants and representations. As of 
 December 31, 2024, 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants.

The events of default under the Financing Agreement are customary for financings of this type. If an event of default occurs, the Administrative Agent is entitled to take enforcement action, including acceleration of amounts due under the Financing Agreement.

The Company evaluated whether the Initial Term Loan represented a debt modification or extinguishment of the First Amendment with Hercules with ASC 
470
-
50,
 Debt – Modifications and Extinguishments. As a result of the Initial Term Loan and effective termination of the First Amendment with Hercules, this transaction was accounted for by the Company under the extinguishment accounting model. The Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $
4.6
 million in the Company’s statement of operations for the 
three
 and 
nine
 months ended 
 September 30, 2024, 
representing the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and a prepayment charge. The Company capitalized 
third
 party fees from the Initial Term Loan to debt issuance costs and capitalized the facility fee incurred with the Administrative Agent as part of the Initial Term Loan to debt discount.

The Company incurred total financing and upfront costs of $
6.0
 million related to the Initial Term Loan which are recorded as debt issuance costs and debt discount costs and as an offset to loan payable on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The debt issuance and debt discount costs are being amortized over the term of the debt using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method, and will be included in interest expense in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. Amortization of debt issuance and debt discount costs was $

 LEASES 

In 
 October 2014, 
we entered into an agreement (the Office Agreement) with Fortress Biotech, Inc. (FBIO) to occupy approximately 
45
% of the 
24,000
 square feet of New York City office space leased by FBIO. The Office Agreement requires us to pay our respective share of the average annual rent and other costs of the 
15
-year lease. We approximate an average annual rental obligation of $
1.8
 million under the Office Agreement. We began to occupy this new space in 
 April 2016, 
with rental payments beginning in the 
third
 quarter of 
2016.
 At 
 January 1, 2019, 
we recognized a lease liability and corresponding right-of-use (ROU) asset of $
9.5
 million and $
8.1
 million, respectively, based on the present value of the remaining lease payments for all of our leased office spaces, the majority of which is comprised of our New York City office space. The present values of our lease liability and corresponding ROU asset are $
9.3
 million and $
7.2
 million, respectively, as of 
 December 31, 2024
. Our leases have remaining lease terms of approximately 
one
 month to 
7
 years. One lease has a renewal option to extend the lease for an additional term of 
five
 years.

Also, in connection with this lease, in 
 October 2014 
we pledged $
0.6
 million to secure a line of credit as a security deposit for the Office Agreement, which has been recorded as restricted cash in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Additional collateral of $
0.6

 April 2018 
to increase the letter of credit for the office space.

In 
 October 2019,

0.3
 million under the NJ Lease. The NJ Lease expires on 
 January 30, 2025 
and will 
not
 be renewed.

In 
 October 2021, 
we finalized a 
five
-year lease for office space in North Carolina (the NC Lease). We approximate an average annual rental obligation of $
0.2
 million under the NC Lease. We took possession of this space in 
 February 2022,

 INCOME TAXES

We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, management reviews both positive and negative evidence, including current and historical results of operations, future income projections and the overall prospects of our business. Based upon management's assessment of all available evidence, we believe that it is more-likely-than-
not
 that the deferred tax assets will 
not
 be realizable, and therefore, a valuation allowance has been established. The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was approximately $
414.6
 million and $
418.3
 million as of 
 December 31, 2024 
and 
2023,
 respectively. 

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 
2017
 (“TCJA”) included changes to the treatment of research and development expenses under IRC Section 
174.
  Formerly, a company could deduct research and development expenses under IRC Section 
174
 as incurred.  Effective for tax years beginning after 
 December 31, 2021, 
research and development expenses under IRC Section 
174
 are required to be capitalized, with an amortization period of 
5
 years for costs incurred in the US and 
15
 years for costs incurred in a non-US jurisdiction.  The Company incurred approximately $
78.9
 million and $
61.8
 million of US research and development costs and approximately $
6.2
 million and $
13.9
 million of non-US research and development costs that were capitalized during the years ended 
 December 31, 2024 
and 
2023,
 respectively.

The Inflation Reduction Act of 
2022
 (“IRA”) was enacted on 
 August 16, 2022.  
The IRA provided for a Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (“Corp AMT”), applicable to tax years beginning after 
 December 31, 2022.  
The Corp AMT will impose a 
15%
 tax on companies with adjusted financial statement income of over 
$1
 billion for U.S. based organizations.  At this time, it is 
not
 anticipated that the Corp AMT will be applicable for the Company.  

As of 
 December 31, 2024, 
we have U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $
2.0
 billion and research and development credit carryforwards (“R&D credits”) of approximately $
50.7
 million.  For income tax purposes, these NOLs and R&D credits will expire in various amounts through 
2045.
 NOLs generated after 
2017
 do 
not
 expire. The Tax Reform Act of 
1986
 contains provisions which limit the ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards and R&D credit carryforwards in the case of certain events including significant changes in ownership interests.  The exchange transaction with TG Bio 
 may 
have resulted in a “change in ownership” as defined by IRC Section 
382
 of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986,
 as amended. Additionally, stock issuance activities 
 may 
have resulted in a “change in ownership” as defined by IRC Section 
382
 of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986,
 as amended.  Accordingly, a substantial portion of the Company’s NOLs above 
 may 
be subject to annual limitations in reducing any future year’s taxable income, and a substantial portion of the R&D Credit carryforwards 
 may 
be subject to annual limitations in reducing any future year’s tax.

We file income tax returns in the U.S Federal and various state and local jurisdictions. With certain exceptions, the Company is 
no
 longer subject to U.S. Federal and state income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 
2021.
 However, NOLs and tax credits generated from those prior years could still be adjusted upon audit.

 ​

The Company would recognize interest and penalties, if any, to uncertain tax position in income tax expense in the statement of operations. There was 
no
 accrual for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions for 
2024.
 We do 
not
 believe that there will be a material change in our unrecognized tax positions over the next 
twelve
 months. All of the unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would be offset by the valuation allowance.

 LICENSE AGREEMENTS

BRIUMVI (Ublituximab)

In 
 January 2012, 
we entered into an exclusive license agreement with LFB Biotechnologies, GTC Biotherapeutics and LFB/GTC LLC, all wholly-owned subsidiaries of LFB Group, relating to the development of ublituximab (the LFB License Agreement). Under the terms of the LFB License Agreement, we have acquired the exclusive worldwide rights (exclusive of France/Belgium) for the development and commercialization of ublituximab. For the period ended 
 December 31, 2024
, we have incurred expenses of approximately $
31.0
 million related to the achievement of certain milestones of the LFB License Agreement. These expenses are included in other research and development expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. As of 
 December 31, 2024
, we had approximately 
zero
 recorded in accounts payable related to the LFB License Agreement.

The license will terminate on a country-by-country basis upon the expiration of the last licensed patent right or 
15
 years after the 
first
 commercial sale of a product in such country, unless the agreement is earlier terminated (i) by LFB if the Company challenges any of the licensed patent rights, (ii) by either party due to a breach of the agreement, or (iii) by either party in the event of the insolvency of the other party. During the year ended 
 December 31, 2024, 
the Company recorded $
30.7
 million related to the worldwide royalty due under the LFB  License Agreement in cost of  revenue based on U.S. sales of BRIUMVI and as of 
 December 31, 2024, 
approximately $
10.3
 million in royalties were payable under the LFB License Agreement.

In 
 November 2012, 
we entered into an exclusive (within the territory) sublicense agreement with Ildong Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (Ildong) relating to the development and commercialization of ublituximab in South Korea and Southeast Asia. Under the terms of the sublicense agreement, Ildong has been granted a royalty bearing, exclusive right, including the right to grant sublicenses, to develop and commercialize ublituximab in South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, Vietnam, and Myanmar.

An upfront payment of $
2.0
 million, which was received in 
 December 2012, 
net of $
0.3
 million of income tax withholdings, is being recognized as license revenue on a straight-line basis over the life of the agreement, which is through the expiration of the last licensed patent right or 
15
 years after the 
first
 commercial sale of a product in such country, unless the agreement is earlier terminated, and represents the estimated period over which we will have certain ongoing responsibilities under the sublicense agreement. We recorded license revenue of approximately $
0.2
 million for each of the years ended 
 December 31, 2024, 
2023
 and 
2022
, and at 
 December 31, 2024 
and 
2023
, have deferred revenue of approximately $
0.2
 million and $
0.3
 million, respectively, associated with this $
2
 million payment.

We 
 may 
receive up to an additional $
5.0
 million in payments upon the achievement of pre-specified milestones. In addition, upon commercialization, Ildong will make royalty payments to us on net sales of ublituximab in the sublicense territory.

In 
 July 2023, 
the Company entered into the Commercialization Agreement with Neuraxpharm. The Company granted Neuraxpharm the exclusive right to commercialize BRIUMVI in certain territories outside the United States, Canada, and Mexico, the commercialization rights for which had been previously retained by the Company, thus, and excluding certain Asian countries subject to previously existing partnerships. Under the terms of the Commercialization Agreement, the Company received a 
one
-time, non-refundable payment of $
140.0
 million upon contract execution (please refer to Note 
2
 – Revenue). The Company received a $
12.5
 million milestone payment in 
2024
 upon the 
first
 key market commercial launch in the EU and is eligible to receive up to an additional $
480.0
 million in milestone-based payments on achievement of certain launch and commercial milestones. In addition, TG will receive tiered double-digit royalties on net product sales up to 
30
%. Royalty revenue of $
0.8
 million was recognized during the year ended 
 December 31, 2024. 
In the event of a change of control of the Company (as defined in the Commercialization Agreement), the Company retains an option to buy back all rights under the Commercialization Agreement for a period of 
two
 years thereafter.

2015,

 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Purchase Commitments

We contract with various 
third
 parties to conduct certain activities including clinical operations and contract manufacturing, and for the clinical and commercial supply of BRIUMVI. Certain contracts contain non-cancellable features or require us to make binding forecasts for future purchases. As of 
 December 31, 2024 
the Company had aggregate non-cancelable purchase commitments of $
214.7
 million, of which $
64.2
 million, $
74.4
 million and $
76.1
 million are expected to be incurred in the years 
2025,

2026
 and 
2027,
 respectively. These amounts do 
not
 represent the Company's entire anticipated purchases in the future as the amounts of such obligations are dependent on the timing of future orders, and the terms of the agreement, which we believe at this time cannot be reasonably estimated.
