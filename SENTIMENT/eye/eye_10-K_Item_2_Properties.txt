Item 2. Properties
We lease all of our America’s Best and Eyeglass World retail stores. Our leases generally have noncancelable lease terms of between five and 10 years, with an option to renew for additional terms of one to 10 years or more. In recent years, we have entered into more leases with 10-year initial terms with renewal options. Most leases for these retail stores provide for a minimum rent, typically with escalating rent increases. In certain circumstances we pay a percentage rent based upon sales after certain minimum thresholds are achieved. These leases generally require us to pay insurance, utilities, real estate taxes and common area maintenance expenses.
We occupy our Host locations through master agreements with our Host partners, which contain standard terms and conditions, such as fixed and percentage-based payments.
