PART II 
Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
Market Information
Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “EYE.”
Holders
As of February 14, 2025, there were approximately 13 holders of record of our common stock. The number of holders of record is based upon the actual number of holders registered at such date and does not represent the actual number of beneficial owners of our common stock because shares are frequently held in “street name” by securities dealers and others for the benefit of individual owners. 
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
During the quarter ended December 28, 2024, we did not purchase any of our equity securities that are registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act.
Effective November 8, 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) authorized the Company to repurchase up to $50 million aggregate amount of shares of the Company’s common stock. On November 29, 2021, the Board authorized an increase from $50 million to $100 million in aggregate amount of shares of the Company’s common stock that may be repurchased under the Company’s current share repurchase program. On February 23, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a $100 million increase to the share repurchase authorization, for a total authorization of $200 million.  During fiscal years 2023 and 2022, the Company repurchased 1.1 million shares of its common stock for $25.0 million and 2.7 million shares of its common stock for $80.0 million, respectively, under the share repurchase program. The Company’s original share repurchase authorization expired on December 30, 2023, and had remaining capacity of $25 million. Effective February 23, 2024, the Board authorized the Company to repurchase up to $50 million aggregate amount of shares of the Company’s common stock until January 3, 2026. The authorization permits the Company to make purchases of its common stock from time to time in the open market or privately negotiated transactions, and pursuant to pre-set trading plans meeting the requirements of all applicable securities laws and regulations. The timing and amounts of any such repurchases will depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of the Company’s shares, general market and economic conditions, legal requirements and tax implications. The Company expects to fund the share repurchases using cash on hand.
Dividends
We have not paid dividends in the past and have no current plans to pay dividends on our common stock.

Overview
We are one of the largest optical retailers in the United States (the “U.S.”) and a leader in the attractive value segment of the U.S. optical retail industry. We believe that vision is central to quality of life and that people deserve to see their best to live their best, regardless of their budget. We achieve this by providing eye exams, eyeglasses and contact lenses to value-seeking consumers with an opening price point that strives to be among the lowest in the industry. We reach our customers through a diverse portfolio of 1,240 retail stores across four brands and multiple consumer websites as of fiscal year end 2024.
Brand and Segment Information
As of December 28, 2024, our operations consisted of one reportable segment:
•
Owned & Host – As of fiscal ye
ar end 2024, our owned brands consist
ed of 1,036 America’s Best Contacts and Eyeglasses (“America’s Best”) retail stores and 122 Eyeglass World retail stores. In America’s Best stores, vision care services are provided by optometrists employed by u
s or by independent professional corporations or similar entities. America’s Best stores are primarily located in high-traffic strip centers next to value-focused retailers. Eyeglass World locations offer eye exams, provided primarily by independent optometrists and optometrists employed by independent professional corporations or similar entities, and have on-site optical laboratories that enable 
stores to quickly fulfill many customer orders and make repairs on site. Eyeglass World stores are primarily located in freestanding or in-line locations near high-foot-traffic shopping centers. Our Host brands consisted of 53 Vista Optical locations on select military bases and 29 Vista Optical locations within select Fred Meyer stores as of fiscal year end 2024. We have strong, long-standing relationships with our Host partners and 
have maintained each partners
hip for over 20 years. These brands provide eye exams primarily by independent optometrists. All brands utilize ou
r centralized laboratories.
 This segment also includes sales from our America’s Best, Eyeglass World, and Military omni-channel websites.
Our consolidated results for all periods presented in this Form 10-K also include the following:
•
Results of other operating segments — Our dedicated e-commerce website, which was previously managed by AC Lens and was transitioned to NVI. Our e-commerce website sells contact lenses and optical accessory products to retail customers, and recognizes revenue when products have been delivered to the customer. Managed care business conducted by FirstSight, our wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed as a single-service health plan under California law, which issues individual vision plans in connection with our America’s Best operations in California.
•
Corporate and other — Our corporate and other category represents unallocated corporate overhead expenses, which are a component of selling, general and administrative expenses and are comprised of various home office expenses such as payroll, occupancy costs and consulting and professional fees. Corporate overhead expenses also include field services for our four retail brands. Other expenses included in this category include certain non-cash charges, including asset impairment, stock-based compensation expense, and the impact of certain events, gains, or losses excluded from the assessment of segment performance.
•
Effects of unearned and deferred revenue — Reportable segment information is presented on the same basis as our consolidated financial statements, except reportable segment sales which are presented on a cash basis, including point of sales for managed care payors and excluding the effects of unearned and deferred revenue, consistent with what our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) regularly reviews. We present the effects of unearned and deferred revenues separately from our reportable segment information. See Note 16. “Segment Reporting” in our consolidated financial statements. Deferred revenue represents the timing difference of when we collect the cash from the customer and when services related to product protection plans and eye care club memberships are performed. Increases or decreases in deferred revenue during the reporting period represent cash collections in excess of, or below the recognition of, previous deferrals. Unearned revenue represents the timing difference of when we collect cash from the customer and delivery/customer acceptance, and includes sales of prescription eyewear during approximately the last seven to ten days of the reporting period.

Trends and Other Factors Affecting Our Business 
During fiscal 2024, we implemented transformation initiatives intended to accelerate long-term growth and strengthen profitability, including new additions to our executive leadership team, continued expansion of exam capacity, new traffic-driving initiatives, and a review of our store fleet. Additionally, we continued to make progress against our continued growth initiatives, including the expansion of our remote medicine capabilities; focusing on the recruiting and retention of optometrists; increasing our marketing efficiency and omnichannel capabilities; increasing our participation in vision insurance programs; and the further digitization of our stores and corporate office. Going into fiscal 2025, we will be focused on expanding our target demographic, implementing new pricing architecture, enhancing the customer and patient experience, and optimizing cost structure, which are designed to strengthen our core business, improve our results of operations, and drive long-term shareholder value.
We opened 69 new stores in 2024 and completed a comprehensive review of our portfolio of stores to optimize our fleet for profitability and overall performance. As a result of the comprehensive review, we closed 12 stores and converted four Eyeglass World stores to America’s Best stores in 2024 and plan to close an additional 27 stores by the end of 2026. In connection with this review, we have recorded certain impairment of intangible assets, property and equipment and ROU assets, as well as one-time non-recurring exit charges associated with the closures. Refer to Note 1. “Description of Business and Basis of Presentation” and Note 11. “Fair Value Measurement” for information on the impairment charges and costs incurred related to the store fleet review.
We are continuing to invest in the digitization of our stores, including remote medicine capabilities and an EHR platform. As of December 28, 2024, remote medicine technology has been enabled in over 730 of our America’s Best locations. We believe remote medicine not only helps provide more access to eye care for patients, it also helps address constraints in exam capacity. We have also invested in the transition to an EHR platform.

We anticipate continuing the investment in remote medicine primarily in America’s Best stores in the near term, adding select locations where feasible and advantageous and depending on the state-by-state regulatory environment. While the remote medicine and EHR platforms have increased exam capacity, revenue and profitability, we have experienced higher costs applicable to revenue as a percentage of revenue, when compared with in-store exams.
The overall economic environment continues to be challenging and macroeconomic factors that may affect customer spending patterns, and thereby our results of operations, include inflation, employment rates, business conditions, changes in the housing market, the availability of credit, interest rates, tax rates and policies, fuel and energy costs and overall consumer confidence in future economic conditions, as well as g
lobal political, socio-economic, cultural, and geopolitical uncertainty
.
We operate in the highly competitive and fragmented U.S. optical retail in
dustry. We face competition from mass merchants, specialty retail chains, online retailers and independent eye practitioners and opticians, along with large national retailers. Increased consolidation activity in the industry may enable our competitors to benefit from purchasing advantages and the ability to leverage management capabilities across a larger business base. Along with our competitors, we are affected by a number of various trends and factors, including, but not limited to, economic conditions, availability of vision care professionals, inflation, consumer preferences and demand.
Our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified vision care professionals impacts exam capacity and our operations, like those of many of our competitors, depend on our ability to offer both eyewear and eye exams. We believe factors such as an increasingly challenging recruiting market (in particular for new graduates), preferences for adjusted work schedules, and the demand for optometrists exceeding supply in certain areas during fiscal year 2024 have caused constraints in vision care professional availability and therefore exam capacity which are continuing. As a result, recruiting and retaining optometrists has become more challenging and the costs to employee or retain optometrists have increased and may increase further, potentially materially. Targeted wage investments, including increases in compensation for our optometrists and associates, and flexibility initiatives have impacted our costs applicable to revenue and selling, general and administrative expenses. We anticipate that wage pressures in certain markets will continue in 2025.

Wage investment pressure and increases to costs applicable to revenue from increases in raw materials prices may not be able to be fully offset by leverage from revenue growth, productivity efficiency and, as appropriate, various pricing actions. We are continuing to strategically invest in recruitment and retention initiatives, including flexible adjusted work schedules, along with continuing our implementation of remote medicine technologies, which has expanded our offerings while also increasing costs.
While there are ranges of customer behaviors based on demographics and other factors, we estimate that our customers typically replace their eyeglasses every two to three years and their contact lenses every six to 12 months, reflecting the predictability of these recurring purchase behaviors; however, the effects of the current macroeconomic environment and geopolitical uncertainty, resulted in reduced customer demand in 2024 and have 
47
Table of Contents
caused shifts in consumer behaviors and preferences, which impact the demand for our products. As a result, the predictability of recurring purchase behavior for the future remains uncertain. 
In addition to the central factors impacting our business outlined above, we have identified the following key drivers, challenges and risks on which we are focused and which are detailed below
.
Inflation
Elevated inflation can result in increased costs and greater profitability pressure for us. While pressures from increases to the price of our raw materials have had an impact on our costs applicable to revenue in fiscal year 2024, we have been able to offset these pressures with efficiencies in our laboratory network, pricing actions and lower freight costs. We anticipate that pressures from increases to our raw materials prices could have an impact on our costs applicable to revenue in fiscal year 2025. Such an inflationary environment and labor market challenges can also result in wage pressures in certain markets. Wage investments as a result of inflation and an increasingly competitive recruiting market for vision care professionals that became more acute during the COVID -19 pandemic and related effects have had, and may continue to have, an impact on our profitability.
New Store Openings
We expect that new stores will continue to b
e a key driver of growth in
 our net revenue and operating profit in the future. Our results of operations have been and will continue to be materially affected by the timing and number of new store openings. As stores mature, profitability typically increases significantly. The performance of new stores is dependent upon factors such as the availability of optometrists, implementation and operation of remote medicine technology, the time of year of a particular opening, the amount of store pre-opening costs, labor and occupancy costs in the specified market, level of participation in managed care plans, and location, including whether they are in new or existing markets. 
During fiscal 2024, we announced plans to temporarily moderate new store openings in 2025 to 30-35 new stores, after which time we expect to return to our more recent store opening cadence as strategic initiatives begin to take hold. 
Comparable Store Sales Growth 
Comparable store sales growth is a key driver of our business. Many factors affect comparable store sales, including:
•
consumer confidence, preferences and buying trends and overall economic trends including inflation and the amount and timing of tax refunds;
•
the availability of optometrists and other vision care professionals;
•
advertising strategies;
•
participation in managed care programs;
•
the recurring nature of eye care purchases;
•
our ability to identify and respond effectively to customer preferences and trends;
•
our ability to provide an assortment of high quality/low-cost product offerings that generate new and repeat visits to our stores;
•
foot traffic in retail shopping centers where our stores are predominantly located;
•
the customer experience we provide in our stores;
•
our ability to source and receive products accurately and timely;
•
changes in product pricing, including promotional activities;
•
the number of items purchased per store visit;
•
the number of stores that have been in operation for more than 12 months;
•
impact of competition and consolidation in the U.S. optical retail industry;
•
impact and timing of weather-related store closures; and
•
public health emergencies which may exacerbate the effects and relevant risk exposures listed above.
A new store is included in the comparable store sales calculation during the 13th full fiscal month following the store’s opening. Closed stores are removed from the calculation for time periods that are not comparable. In the past, we have closed stores as a result of poor store performance, lease expiration or non-renewal and/or the terms of our arrangements with our Host partners.
Managed Care and Insurance
Managed care has become increasingly important to the optical retail industry. An increasing percentage of our customers receive vision care insurance coverage through managed care payors. Our participation in these programs represent an increasingly significant portion of our overall revenues and represented appro
ximately 40% and 37% of 
our overall revenues from continuing operations in fiscal years 
2024 and 2023, respectively
. While we 
have relationships with almost all vision care insurers in the U.S. and with all of the major carriers, currently, a relatively small number of payors comprise the majority of our managed care revenues, subjecting us to concentration risk. As 
48
Table of Contents
our participation in managed care programs continues to expand, we have incurred and
 expect to incur additional costs related to this area of our business. Our comparable store sales growth as noted above as well as overall future operational success could depend on our ability to negotiate, maintain and extend contracts with managed vision care companies, vision insurance providers and other third-party payors, several of whom have significant market share. Coverage and payment levels are determined at each third-party payor’s discretion, and we have limited control over a third-party payor’s decision-making with respect to coverage and payment levels. Coverage restrictions and reductions in reimbursement levels or payment methodologies may negatively impact our sales and profits. In addition, as our participation in managed care programs continues to approach overall industry penetration levels, we expect our associated managed care revenue growth rate to slow over time.
Infrastructure Investment
Our historical results of operations reflect the impact of our ongoing investments in infrastructure to support our growth. We have made and continue to make significant investments in information technology systems, including those to support our point-of-sale system, ERP, CRM, e-commerce platforms, supply chain systems, marketing, and personnel, as well as experienced industry executives, and management and merchandising teams to support our long-term growth objectives. We intend to continue to make targeted investments in our infrastructure to support our growth and continue the digitization of our stores and corporate office.
Pricing Strategy
We are committed to providing our products to our customers at low prices. We have historically employed a simple, low price/high value strategy and seek to balance our pricing and growth in a way that consistently delivers savings to our customers. Inflationary pressures, including elevated wages, consumer confidence and preferences and increased raw material costs, could impact our profitability and lead us to att
empt to offset such increases through various pricing actions. From time to time, and increasingly in connection with our new transformation initiatives, we have taken and may continue to take pricing actions and introduce limited-time promotions or new offers designed to increase demand traffic, awareness and drive sales.

Effective January 26, 2025, we implemented a $10 price increase to each of our America’s Best signature offer and our Eyeglass World opening offer. We believe that these changes will enable us to continue to offer the best possible value and service to our customers at prices that allow 
us to maintain our brands’ strong value propositions in the marketplace.
Interim Results and Seasonality
Historically, our business has realized a higher portion of net revenue, operating income, and cash flows from operations in the first half of the fiscal y
ear, and a lower portion of net revenue, operating income, and cash flows from operations in the fourth fiscal quarter. The first half seasonality is attributable primarily to the timing of our customers’ income tax refunds and annual health insurance program start/reset periods. We believe that many customers in our target market of value-seeking consumers may rely on tax refunds to pay for eyewear and eye care. A delay in the issuance of tax refunds or changes in the amount of tax refunds can accordingly have a negative impact on our quarterly financial results in the first half of the year. Consumer behavior with respect to the utilization of tax refund proceeds is also subject to change.
With respect to our fourth quarter results, compared to other retailers, our products and services are less likely to be included in consumers’ holiday spending budgets, therefore reducing spending on personal vision correction during the weeks preceding December 25th of each year. Additionally, although the period between December 25th and the end of our fiscal year is typically a high-volume period, the net revenue associated with substantially all orders of prescription eyeglasses and contact lenses during that period is deferred until the following fiscal period due to our policy of recognizing revenue only after the product has been accepted by the customer, further contributing to higher revenue results in the first half of the year. Our quarterly results may also be affected by the timing of new store openings and store closings, the amount of sales contributed by new and existing stores, the timing of certain holidays, and the timing of weather-related store closures.
For both fiscal years 2024 and 2023, approximately 24% of our revenue was recorded in the fourth quarter, but approximately 25% of annual SG&A costs were recorded in the respective fourth quarters of these fiscal years. 
Termination of our Walmart partnership and wind down of AC Lens operations
Effective as of February 23, 2024, the Company has completed the transition of 229 Walmart Vision Center stores. Additionally, the agreements governing our provision of contact lens distribution and related services to Walmart and Sam’s Club terminated during the second quarter of 2024 and the Company wound down the majority of AC Lens operations, including the closure of its Ohio distribution center, which largely supported the wholesale distribution and e-commerce contact lens services that the Company provided to Walmart and Sam’s Club. We have transitioned the order fulfillment functions previously handled by AC Lens to a third-party vendor. While we are 
49
Table of Contents
seeking to reduce costs and replace lost business with new America’s Best or Eyeglass World stores and by other means, including pricing actions, we may not be successful in our efforts, which could impact our revenues and profitability. In fiscal years 2024 and 2023, we have incurred costs in connection with the termination of our partnership with Walmart and related wind down of AC Lens operations. As a result of the termination of our partnership with Walmart and wind down of AC Lens operations, our former Legacy reportable segment and the majority of our former AC Lens operations as well as related effects of unearned and deferred revenue met the criteria to be presented as discontinued operations. The plan has been substantially completed and we do not anticipate additional material costs related to this plan. Refer to Note 2. “Discontinued Operations” and Note 3. “Details of Cost Savings Plan” for more information on these costs.
How We Assess the Performance of Our Business
We consider a variety of financial and operating measures in assessing the performance of our business. The key measures we use to determine how our consolidated business and operating segments are performing are net revenue, costs applicable to revenue, and selling, general, and administrative expenses, which are described further in  Note 16. “Segment Reporting” and Note 1. “Business and Significant Accounting Policies,” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II. Item 8. of this Form 10-K. In addition, we also review store growth, Adjusted Comparable Store Sales Growth, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Adjusted Diluted EPS.
Net Revenue
We report as net revenue amounts generated in transactions with retail customers who are the end users of our products, services, and plans. Comparable store sales growth and new store openings are key drivers of net revenue and are discussed below. Also, the timing of unearned revenue can affect revenue recognized in a particular period.
Costs Applicable to Revenue
Customer tastes and preferences, product mix, changes in technology, significant increases or slowdowns in production, and other factors impact costs applicable to revenue. The components of our costs applicable to revenue may not be comparable to other retailers.
Selling, General and Administrative
SG&A generally fluctuates consistently with revenue due to the variable store, field office and corporate support costs; however, some fixed costs slightly improve as a percentage of net revenue as our net revenues grow over time.
New Store Openings
The total number of new stores per year and the timing of store openings has, and will continue to have, an impact on our results. We opened 69 stores during fiscal year 2024. During fiscal 2024, we announced plans to temporarily moderate new store openings in 2025 to 30-35 new stores, after which time we expect to return to our more recent store opening cadence as strategic initiatives begin to take hold. We will continue to monitor and determine our plans for future new store openings based on health, safety and economic conditions.
Adjusted Comparable Store Sales Growth
We measure Adjusted Comparable Store Sales Growth as the increase or decrease in sales recorded by the comparable store base in any reporting period, compared to sales recorded by the comparable store base in the prior reporting period, which we calculate as follows: (i) sales are recorded on a cash basis (i.e., when the order is placed and paid for or submitted to a managed care payor, compared to when the order is delivered), utilizing cash basis point of sale information from stores; (ii) stores are added to the calculation during the 13th full fiscal month following the store’s opening; (iii) closed stores are removed from the calculation for time periods that are not comparable; (iv) sales from partial months of operation are excluded when stores do not open or close on the first day of the month; and (v) when applicable, we adjust for the effect of the 53rd week. Quarterly, year-to-date and annual adjusted comparable store sales are aggregated using only sales from all whole months of operation included in both the current reporting period and the prior reporting period. When a partial month is excluded from the calculation, the corresponding month in the subsequent period is also excluded from the calculation. There may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable store sales. As a result, our adjusted comparable store sales may not be comparable to similar data made available by other retailers.
50
Table of Contents
Adjusted Comparable Store Sales Growth is a non-GAAP financial measure, which we believe is useful because it provides timely and accurate information relating to the two core metrics of retail sales: number of transactions and value of transactions. We use Adjusted Comparable Store Sales Growth as the basis for key operating decisions, such as allocation of advertising to particular markets and implementation of special marketing programs. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted Comparable Store Sales Growth provides timely and accurate information relating to the operational health and overall performance of each brand. We also believe that, for the same reasons, investors find our calculation of Adjusted Comparable Stores Sales Growth to be meaningful.
Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and Adjusted Diluted EPS (collectively, the “Company Non-GAAP Measures”)
The Company Non-GAAP Measures are key measures used by management to assess our financial performance. The Company Non-GAAP Measures are also frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties. We use the Company Non-GAAP Measures to supplement U.S. GAAP measures of performance to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, to make budgeting decisions, to establish discretionary annual incentive compensation and to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for definitions of the Company Non-GAAP Measures and for additional information.

(1)
We calculate total comparable store sales from continuing operations based on consolidated net revenue from continuing operations excluding the impact of (i) other segments revenue, (ii) sales from stores opened less than 13 months, (iii) stores closed in the periods presented, (iv) sales from partial months of operation when stores do not open or close on the first day of the month and (v) if applicable, the impact of a 53rd week in a fiscal year. Brand-level comparable store sales growth is calculated based on cash basis revenues consistent with what the CODM reviews, and consistent with reportable segment revenues presented in Note 16. “Segment Reporting” in our consolidated financial statements.

Percentages reflect line item as a percentage of net revenue, adjusted for rounding.
(3)
Adjusted Comparable Store Sales Growth from continuing operations includes the effect of deferred and unearned revenue as if such revenues were earned at the point of sale, resulting in a decrease of 0.6% and a decrease of 0.1% from total comparable store sales growth from continuing operations based on consolidated net revenue from continuing operations for fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Total net revenue of $1,823.3 million for fiscal year 2024 increased $66.9 million, or 3.8%, from $1,756.4 million for fiscal year 2023. Of the increase, approximately 90% was driven by growth from new store sales, approximately 30% was driven by Adjusted Comparable Store Sales Growth from continuing operations and approximately 10% was driven by the timing of unearned revenue, partially offset by approximately 20% from converted and closed stores and 10% from lower revenue from our dedicated e-commerce consumer website, DiscountContacts.com.
Comparable store sales growth and Adjusted Comparable Store Sales Growth from continuing operations for fiscal year 2024 were 1.9% and 1.3%, respectively, both primarily driven by higher average ticket.
During fiscal year 2024, we opened 66 new America’s Best stores and three new Eyeglass World stores and closed 11 America’s Best stores, five Eyeglass World stores, and one Military store as a result of the host partner’s decision to cease its overall operations at the location; we also converted 24 Eyeglass World Stores to America’s Best stores. Overall, store count grew 4.4% from the end of fiscal year 2023 to the end of fiscal year 2024 (exclusive of the aforementioned conversions, we had 55 net new America’s Best stores, and two net Eyeglass World stores and one net Military store closed).
Net product sales comprised 80.2% and 81.0% of total net revenue for fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net product sales increased $39.9 million, or 2.8% during fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023, primarily due to a $30.7 million, or 2.8%, increase in eyeglass sales, and a $6.0 million, or 2.0%, increase in contact lens sales.
Net sales of services and plans increased $27.0 million, or 8.1%, driven primarily by higher exam revenues of $25.8 million, or 12.4%.
53
Table of Contents
Owned & Host segment net revenue.
 Net revenue increased $64.2 million, or 3.7%, driven primarily by new store openings and comparable store sales growth, partially offset by converted and closed stores.
Effects of unearned and deferred revenue. 
Unearned and deferred revenue positively impacted net revenue by $8.3 million during fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023. Net revenue was positively impacted by $8.0 million due to the timing of unearned revenue. Net revenue was positively impacted by $0.3 million due to higher recognition of product protection plan revenue in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023, partially offset by higher sales of club memberships.
Costs applicable to revenue
Costs applicable to revenue of $764.1 million for fiscal year 2024 increased $29.4 million, or 4.0%, from $734.7 million for fiscal year 2023. As a percentage of net revenue, costs applicable to revenue increased from 41.8% for fiscal year 2023 to 41.9% for fiscal year 2024. This increase as a percentage of net revenue was primarily driven by lower eyeglass mix of 50 basis points and growth in optometrist-related costs of 40 basis points and other mix and margin effects of 20 basis points. These costs were partially offset by a 100-basis-point effect from higher exam revenue.
Costs of products as a percentage of net product sales decreased from 29.8% for fiscal year 2023 to 29.6% for fiscal year 2024 primarily driven by other mix and margin effects.
Owned & Host segment costs of products. 
Costs of products as a percentage of net product sales decreased from 28.7% for fiscal year 2023 to 28.6% for fiscal year 2024 primarily driven by other mix and margin effects, partially offset by lower eyeglass mix.
Costs of services and plans as a percentage of net sales of services and plans decreased from 93.2% for fiscal year 2023 to 91.9% for fiscal year 2024. The decrease was primarily driven by higher eye exam revenue, partially offset by growth in optometrist-related costs.
Owned & Host segment costs of services and plans. 
Costs of services and plans as a percentage of net sales of services and plans decreased from 93.1% for fiscal year 2023 to 91.8% for fiscal year 2024. The decrease was primarily driven by higher eye exam revenue, partially offset by growth in optometrist-related costs.
Selling, general and administrative
SG&A of $938.5 million for fiscal year 2024 increased $33.8 million, or 3.7%, from fiscal year 2023. As a percentage of net revenue, SG&A was 51.5% for fiscal year 2023 compared with 51.5% for fiscal year 2024. SG&A as a percentage of net revenue was primarily impacted by lower performance-based incentive compensation of 80 basis points, offset by higher occupancy of 30 basis points, as well as legal and professional expenses of 30 basis points and litigation settlement of 20 basis points.
Owned & Host segment SG&A. 
SG&A as a percentage of net revenue increased from 38.7% for fiscal year 2023 to 39.5% for fiscal year 2024 driven primarily by higher payroll and occupancy expense.
Depreciation and amortization
Depreciation and amortization expense of $91.3 million for fiscal year 2024 increased $1.5 million, or 1.6%, from $89.9 million for fiscal year 2023 primarily driven by new store openings and investments in remote medicine technology, partially offset by lower depreciation of labs and distribution center.
Asset impairment 
We recognized $39.9 million during fiscal year 2024 primarily for impairment related to the Eyeglass World goodwill, Fred Meyer contracts and relationships intangible asset, and tangible long-lived assets and ROU assets associated with our retail stores during fiscal year 2024, compared to $2.7 million recognized in fiscal year 2023. The impairment of Eyeglass World goodwill was due primarily to reduced projections of future growth and profitability. The Fred Meyer contracts and relationships intangible asset impairment was due to the decision to close certain Fred Meyer stores in fiscal year 2025. Refer to Note 5. Goodwill and Intangible Assets for more details on the Eyeglass World goodwill and Fred Meyer contracts and relationships intangible asset. The store asset impairment charge is related to our Owned & Host segment and is driven by lower than projected customer sales volume in certain stores, and other entity-specific assumptions and also reflects the effects of certain store closure decisions made as part of the Company’s store optimization review in the current period. We considered multiple factors including, but not limited to: forecasted scenarios related to store performance and the likelihood that these scenarios would be ultimately realized; and the remaining useful lives of the assets. Asset impairment expenses were recognized in corporate and other.

Table of Contents
Interest expense, net
Interest expense, net, of $16.2 million for fiscal year 2024 increased $1.8 million, or 12.9%, from $14.3 million for fiscal year 2023. The increase was primarily a result of lower income on cash balances of $3.7 million and lower derivative income of $1.3 million, partially offset by lower interest expense on our debt of $2.6 million.
Income tax provision 
Our effective tax rates
 for fiscal year 2024 and fiscal y
ear 2023 were (5.8)% and 62.9%, respectively. The change in effective tax rates reflects
 our statutory federal and state rate
 of 25.2% and 25.2%, respectively, the partial disallowance of the Eyeglass World goodwill impairment loss for income tax purposes and other permanent items.
Discontinued Operations
Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $(1.3) million for fiscal year 2024 compared to $(69.4) million for fiscal year 2023. Net revenue, costs applicable to revenue and SG&A from discontinued operations decreased by $238.6 million, $154.0 million and $65.3 million, respectively, as compared to fiscal year 2023, primarily due to the current year including the discontinued operations results only for a partial period prior to the termination of our partnership with Walmart and the wind-down of AC Lens operations. Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax also reflects $79.5 million of asset impairment charges in fiscal year 2023 that did not recur in fiscal year 2024. Income tax benefit increased by $0.9 million, due to lower income (loss) before income taxes in the current period as compared to the prior year and the partial disallowance of the Legacy segment goodwill impairment loss for income tax purposes in the prior year period as well as other permanent items related to discontinued operation.
Fiscal Year 2023 compared to Fiscal Year 2022

Adjusted Comparable Store Sales Growth from continuing operations includes the effect of deferred and unearned revenue as if such revenues were earned at the point of sale, resulting in a decrease of 0.1% and 0.2% from total comparable store sales growth from continuing operations based on consolidated net revenue from continuing operations for fiscal year 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Total net revenue of $1,756.4 million for fiscal year 2023 increased $111.7 million, or 6.8%, from $1,644.7 million for fiscal year 2022. The increase was driven by approximately 60% from new store openings and 50% from Adjusted Comparable Store Sales Growth from continuing operations, partially offset by closed stores and effects of deferred and unearned revenue.
Comparable store sales growth and Adjusted Comparable Store Sales Growth from continuing operations for fiscal year 2023 were 3.4% and 3.3%, respectively, both reflecting an increase in customer transactions and higher average ticket.
During fiscal year 2023, we opened 58 new America’s Best stores and 12 new Eyeglass World stores and closed six America’s Best stores. The total net new locations in fiscal year 2023 for America’s Best and Eyeglass World were 52 and 12, respectively. Overall, store count grew 5.7% from the end of fiscal year 2022 to the end of fiscal year 2023.
Net product sales comprised 81.0% and 81.5% of total net revenue for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. Net product sales increased $82.9 million, or 6.2% during fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022, primarily due to a $68.8 million, or 6.6%, increase in eyeglass sales and a $12.6 million, or 4.4%, increase in contact lens sales.
Net sales of services and plans increased $28.8 million, or 9.5%, driven primarily by higher exam revenues of $30.4 million, or 17.1%.
Owned & Host segment net revenue.
 Net revenue increased $112.7 million, or 7.0%, driven primarily by new store openings and comparable store sales growth.
Effects of unearned and deferred revenue. 
Unearned and deferred revenue negatively impacted net revenue by $0.8 million during fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022. Net revenue was positively impacted by $4.4 million due to the timing of unearned revenue. Net revenue was negatively impacted by $5.2 million due to higher sales of club memberships and product protection plans, and lower recognition of product protection plan revenue in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022.
Costs applicable to revenue
Costs applicable to revenue of $734.7 million for fiscal year 2023 increased $67.0 million, or 10.0%, from $667.7 million for fiscal year 2022. As a percentage of net revenue, costs applicable to revenue increased from 40.6% for fiscal year 2022 to 41.8% for fiscal year 2023. This increase as a percentage of net revenue was primarily driven by higher growth in optometrist-related costs of 160 basis points and by 60 basis points due to reduction in components of service revenue, including product protection plan revenue, and other mix and margin effects. These costs were partially offset by a 100-basis point effect from higher exam revenue.
Costs of products as a percentage of net product sales decreased from 30.0% for fiscal year 2022 to 29.8% for fiscal year 2023 primarily driven by increased eyeglass mix and higher eyeglass margin.
Owned & Host segment costs of products. 
Costs of products as a percentage of net product sales decreased from 28.9% for fiscal year 2022 to 28.7% for fiscal year 2023 primarily driven by increased eyeglass mix and higher eyeglass margin.
Costs of services and plans as a percentage of net sales of services and plans increased from 87.3% for fiscal year 2022 to 93.2% for fiscal year 2023. The increase was primarily driven by higher growth in optometrist-related costs and lower product protection plans revenues, partially offset by higher eye exam revenue.
Owned & Host segment costs of services and plans. 
Costs of services and plans as a percentage of net sales of services and plans increased from 88.6% for fiscal year 2022 to 93.1% for fiscal year 2023. The increase was primarily driven by higher growth in optometrist-related costs, partially offset by higher eye exam revenue.
Selling, general and administrative
SG&A of $904.8 million for fiscal year 2023 increased $72.1 million, or 8.7%, from fiscal year 2022. As a percentage of net revenue, SG&A increased from 50.6% for fiscal year 2022 to 51.5% for fiscal year 2023. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of net revenue was primarily driven by higher performance-based incentive compensation of 80 basis points, higher payroll of 50 basis points, as well as 20 basis points of other expenses, such as stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by lower advertising expense of 60 basis points.
56
Table of Contents
Owned & Host segment SG&A. 
SG&A as a percentage of net revenue decreased from 38.9% for fiscal year 2022 to 38.7% for fiscal year 2023 driven primarily by lower advertising expense, partially offset by higher payroll.
Depreciation and amortization
Depreciation and amortization expense of $89.9 million for fiscal year 2023 increased $1.2 million, or 1.3%, from $88.7 million for fiscal year 2022 primarily driven by an increase in investments in remote medicine technology and new store openings, partially offset by a shift to cloud-based software investments that are amortized in SG&A.
Asset impairment
We recorded impairment charges of $2.7 million for fiscal year 2023 compared to $5.5 million recognized in fiscal year 2022, related to tangible long-lived assets and ROU assets associated with our Owned & Host segment, which were driven by lower than projected customer sales volume in certain stores, and other entity-specific assumptions. We considered multiple factors including, but not limited to: forecasted scenarios related to store performance and the likelihood that these scenarios would be ultimately realized; and the remaining useful lives of the assets. Asset impairment expenses were recognized in corporate and other.
Other expense (income), net
Other expense (income), net was $(0.1) million for fiscal year 2023 compared to $(2.6) million for fiscal year 2022. This change was primarily a result of a gain of $2.7 million in Other expense (income), net in fiscal year 2022 that did not occur in fiscal year 2023 in connection with the acquisition of our equity method investee by a third party. See Note 1. “Business and Significant Accounting Policies” for further details.
Interest expense, net
Interest expense, net, of $14.3 million for fiscal year 2023 increased $13.9 million from $0.5 million for fiscal year 2022. The increase was primarily a result of lower derivative income of $15.8 million and higher Term Loan A expense of $5.4 million, partially offset by higher income on cash balances of $6.8 million.
Income tax provision 
Our effective tax rates for fiscal year 2023 and fiscal year 2022 were 62.9% and 29.7%, respectively. The change in effective tax rates reflects our statutory federal and state rate of 25.2% and 25.4%, respectively, tax impacts of consolidated VIEs and non-deductible compensation expense as well as effects of other permanent items.
Discontinued Operations
Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $(69.4) million for fiscal year 2023 compared to $5.4 million for fiscal year 2022. Net revenue, costs applicable to revenue, and SG&A from discontinued operations increased by $9.4 million, $8.3 million, $4.4 million, respectively, as compared to fiscal year 2022. The revenue increase was primarily driven by increases in wholesale fulfillment. Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax also reflects $79.4 million of asset impairment charges in fiscal year 2023 due to impairments of goodwill, intangible assets, and tangible long-lived assets in connection with the termination of the Walmart partnership and the wind-down of AC Lens operations. Year over year changes in the income tax provision (benefit) reflect lower income (loss) before income taxes in fiscal year 2023 as compared to fiscal year 2022, the disallowance of the Legacy segment goodwill impairment loss for income tax purposes in fiscal year 2023 as well as other permanent items related to discontinued operations.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Margin, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Adjusted Diluted EPS
We define Adjusted Operating Income as net income (loss), plus interest expense (income), net and income tax provision (benefit), further adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense, (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, asset impairment, litigation settlement, secondary offering expenses, management realignment expenses, long-term incentive plan expenses, ERP and CRM implementation expenses and certain other expenses. We define Adjusted Operating Margin as Adjusted Operating Income as a percentage of net revenue. We define EBITDA as net income (loss), plus interest expense (income), net, income tax provision (benefit) and depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), plus interest expense (income), net, income tax provision (benefit) and depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense, (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, asset impairment, litigation settlement, secondary offering expenses, management realignment expenses, long-term incentive plan expenses, ERP and CRM implementation expenses and certain other expenses. We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue. 
57
Table of Contents
We define Adjusted Diluted EPS as diluted earnings (loss) per share, adjusted for the per share impact of stock-based compensation expense, (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, asset impairment, litigation settlement, secondary offering expenses, management realignment expenses, long-term incentive plan expenses, amortization of debt discounts and deferred financing costs of our term loan borrowings, amortization of the conversion feature and deferred financing costs related to our 2025 N
otes when not required under U.S. GAAP to be added back for diluted earnings (loss) per share, derivative fair value adjustments, ERP and CRM implementation expenses, certain other expenses, less the tax effect of these adjustments including tax expense (benefit) from stock-based compensation.
When presenting Adjusted Operating Income from continuing operations, EBITDA from continuing operations and Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations we use the same definitions for Adjusted Operating Income, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, and also exclude income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax. When presenting Adjusted Diluted EPS from continuing operations, we use the same definition for Adjusted Diluted EPS, and also exclude diluted earnings (loss) per share from discontinued operations. When presenting Adjusted Operating Margin from continuing operations, we use Adjusted Operating Income from continuing operations as a percentage of total net revenue. When presenting Adjusted EBITDA Margin from continuing operations, we use Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations as a percentage of total net revenue.
EBITDA and the Company Non-GAAP Measures can vary substantially in size from one period to the next, and certain types of expenses are non-recurring in nature and consequently may not have been incurred in any of the periods presented below. 
EBITDA and the Company Non-GAAP Measures have been presented as supplemental measures of financial performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, because we believe they assist investors and analysts in comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Management believes EBITDA, and the Company Non-GAAP Measures are useful to investors in highlighting trends in our operating performance, while other measures can differ significantly depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and capital investments. We also use EBITDA and the Company Non-GAAP Measures to supplement U.S. GAAP measures of performance in the evaluation of the effectiveness of our business strategies, to make budgeting decisions, to establish discretionary annual incentive compensation and to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. Management supplements U.S. GAAP results with Non-GAAP financial measures to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business than U.S. GAAP results alone. We continue to evaluate our use of the Company Non-GAAP measures in the context of the development of our business, and may introduce or discontinue certain measures in the future as we deem appropriate.
EBITDA and the Company Non-GAAP Measures are not recognized terms under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or income from operations as a measure of financial performance or cash flows provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Additionally, these measures are not intended to be a measure of free cash flow available for management’s discretionary use as they do not consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments and debt service requirements. In evaluating EBITDA and the Company Non-GAAP Measures, we may incur expenses in the future that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of EBITDA and the Company Non-GAAP Measures should not be construed to imply that our future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments. Management compensates for these limitations by primarily relying on our U.S. GAAP results in addition to using EBITDA and the Company Non-GAAP Measures. 
The presentations of these measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are:
•
they do not reflect costs or cash outlays for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;
•
they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;
•
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Operating Income do not reflect the interest expense (income), net or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt;
•
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Operating Income do not reflect period to period changes in taxes, income tax provision or the cash necessary to pay income taxes;
•

Because of these limitations, EBITDA and the Company Non-GAAP Measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to invest in business growth or to reduce indebtedness.

(a)
Non-cash charges related to stock-based compensation programs, which vary from period to period depending on the timing of awards and performance vesting conditions.
(b)
Reflects the extinguishment (gain) loss related to the repurchase of the 2025 Notes of $100.0 million and $217.7 million during  fiscal years 2023 and 2024, respectively.
(c)
Reflects write-off related to non-cash impairment charges, primarily impairment of Eyeglass World goodwill, impairment of Fred Meyer contracts and relationship asset, and impairment of property, equipment and lease-related assets on closed or underperforming stores and certain store closure decisions made as part of the Company’s store optimization review.
(d)
Expenses associated with settlement of certain litigation.
(e)
Amortization of deferred financing costs and other non-cash charges related to our debt. We adjust for amortization of deferred financing costs related to the 2025 Notes only when adjustment for these costs is not required in the calculation of diluted earnings per share under U.S. GAAP.
(f)
The adjustments for the derivative fair value (gains) and losses have the effect of adjusting the (gain) or loss for changes in the fair value of derivative instruments and amortization of AOCL for derivatives not designated as accounting hedges. This results in reflecting derivative (gains) and losses within Adjusted Diluted EPS during the period the derivative is settled.
(g)
Costs related to the Company’s ERP and CRM implementation.
(h)
Other adjustments include amounts that management believes are not representative of our operating performance (amounts in brackets represent reductions in Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS and Adjusted EBITDA), which are primarily related to costs associated with the digitization of paper-based records of $5.8 million and $2.2 million for fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively, costs related to an early lease termination of $0.7 million for fiscal year 2024 and our share of (gains) losses on equity method investment of $(2.7) million for fiscal year 2022, other expenses and adjustments. Other adjustments for both Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS include amortization of the increase in carrying values of finite-lived intangible assets resulting from the application of purchase accounting following the acquisition of the Company by affiliates of KKR & Co. Inc. Adjusted Diluted EPS is also adjusted to include debt issuance costs.
(i)
Represents the income tax effect of the total adjustments at our combined statutory federal and state income tax rates, excluding a portion of Eyeglass World goodwill impairment charge, which was disallowed for income tax purposes, and including tax expense (benefit) from stock-based compensation.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary cash needs are for inventory, payroll, store rent, advertising, capital expenditures associated with new stores and updating existing stores, as well as information and remote medicine technology and infrastructure, including our corporate office, distribution centers and laboratories. When appropriate, the Company may utilize excess liquidity towards debt service requirements, including voluntary debt prepayments, or required interest and principal payments, if any, as well as repurchases of common stock or other securities, based on excess cash flows. The most significant components of our operating assets and liabilities are inventories, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets, accounts payable, deferred and unearned revenue and other payables and accrued expenses. We exercise prudence in our use of cash and closely monitor various items related to cash flow including, but not limited to, cash receipts, cash disbursements, payment terms and alternative sources of funding. We continue to be focused on these items in addition to other key measures we use to determine how our consolidated business and operating segments are performing. We believe that cash on hand, cash expected to be generated from 
60
Table of Contents
operations and the availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements, liquidity obligations, anticipated capital expenditures and payments due under our existing debt for the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Depending on our liquidity levels, conditions in the capital markets and other factors, we may from time to time consider the prepayment, refinancing or issuance of debt, issuance of equity or other securities, the proceeds of which could provide additional liquidity for our operations, as well as modifications to our Term Loan A where possible. 
In August 2024, we established an incremental term loan in the amount of $115.0 million and used the proceeds of this borrowing in addition to cash on hand to repurchase $217.7 million of aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes. Refer to Note 6. "Debt" for more information. Depending on market conditions and other factors, we may elect to repurchase all or a significant portion of our 2025 Notes outstanding principal balance of $84.8 million prior to their maturity on May 15, 2025, utilizing cash on hand and/or one or more of the additional liquidity sources noted above. Our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity may be affected by numerous factors, many of which are outside of our control. We primarily fund our working capital needs using cash provided by operations. Our working capital requirements for inventory will increase as we continue to open additional stores.
As of fiscal year end 2024, we had $73.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and $293.6 million of availability under our revolving credit facility, which includes $6.4 million in outstanding letters of credit.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Cash flows provided by operating activities decreased by $39.4 million to $133.6 million, during fiscal year 2024 from $173.0 million during fiscal year 2023 as a result of a decrease in non-cash reconciling items of $56.3 million and changes in net working capital and other assets and liabilities of $20.5 million, partially offset by an increase in net income of $37.4 million as compared to fiscal year 2023. Both the increase in net income and decrease in non-cash adjustments were primarily driven by the termination of the Walmart partnership and related impairment charges of $79.7 million in the prior year period, partially offset by impairments of long-lived assets and intangible assets of $40.1 million in the current year period.
Decreases in other liabilities used $50.3 million in year-over-year cash primarily due to decreases in compensation related accruals. Decreases in accounts payable used $16.2 million in year-over year cash. These were partially offset by decreases in trade receivables which contributed $44.2 million in year-over-year cash and decreases in inventories which contributed $22.1 million in year-over-year cash during fiscal year 2024. These changes in working capital during fiscal year 2024 are primarily due to the AC Lens wind down and the Walmart partnership termination.
Cash flows provided by operating activities increased by $53.8 million to $173.0 million, during fiscal year 2023 from $119.2 million during fiscal year 2022 as a result of changes in net working capital and other assets and liabilities, which contributed an additional $81.9 million in cash, partially offset by a decrease in net income and non-cash reconciling items of $28.0 million as compared to fiscal year 2022.
Working capital was most significantly impacted by changes in other liabilities and accounts receivable. Increases in other liabilities contributed $54.6 million in year-over-year cash primarily due to increases in compensation related accruals. Decreases in accounts receivable balances contributed $17.0 million in year-over-year cash primarily due to payments of deferred social security taxes in fiscal year 2022 pursuant to the CARES Act that did not recur in fiscal year 2023, and a decrease in managed care receivables due to timing.

Net Cash Used for Investing Activities
Net cash used for investing activities decreased by $19.7 million, to $96.1 million, during fiscal year 2024 from $115.8 million during fiscal year 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower investments in doctor and in-store lab equipment, labs and distribution center, and new stores. We purchased $95.5 million in capital items during fiscal year 2024. Approximately 80% to 85% of our capital spend is related to our expected growth (i.e., new stores, remote medicine infrastructure, EHR, optometric equipment, additional capacity in our optical laboratories and distribution centers, and our IT infrastructure and omni-channel platform related investments). 
Net cash used for investing activities increased by $4.9 million, to $115.8 million, during fiscal year 2023 from $110.9 million during fiscal year 2022. The increase was primarily due to investments in our labs and distribution centers, and store remodeling costs, partially offset by decreased investments in remote medicine. We purchased $114.8 million in capital items during fiscal year 2023. 
Net Cash Provided by (Used for) Financing Activities
Net cash used for financing activities decreased $23.5 million, from $136.8 million use of cash during fiscal year 2023 to $113.3 million use of cash during fiscal year 2024. The decrease in cash used for financing activities was primarily due to an increase in proceeds from long-term debt related to the additional borrowings of $115.0 million and decreases in purchases of treasury stock of $25.3 million partially offset by increased principal payments of debt due to the repurchase of $217.7 million aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes for an aggregate cash repurchase price of $215.0 million in fiscal year 2024 as compared with the repurchase of the 2025 Notes for $99.3 million in fiscal year 2023. 
Net cash used for financing activities increased $52.3 million, from $84.6 million use of cash during fiscal year 2022 to $136.8 million use of cash during fiscal year 2023. The increase in cash used for financing activities was primarily due to a repurchase of $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes for an aggregate cash repurchase price of $99.3 million in fiscal year 2023, partially offset by decreases in purchases of treasury stock of $56.0 million during fiscal year 2023 as compared with 2022.

Share Repurchase Authority
Effective November 8, 2021, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $50 million aggregate amount of shares of the Company's common stock. On November 29, 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized an increase from $50 million to $100 million in aggregate amount of shares of the Company’s common stock that may be repurchased under the Company’s current share repurchase program. On February 23, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a $100 million increase to the share repurchase authorization, for a total authorization of $200 million. The Company’s original share repurchase authorization expired on December 30, 2023, and had remaining capacity of $25 million. Effective February 23, 2024, the Board authorized the Company to repurchase up to $50 million aggregate amount of shares of the Company’s common stock until January 3, 2026. As of December 28, 2024, $50 million remains available under the share repurchase authorization. During fiscal years 2023 and 2022, the Company repurchased 1.1 million shares of its common stock for $25 million and 2.7 million shares of its common stock for $80 million, respectively, under the share repurchase program. The 
62
Table of Contents
authorization permits the Company to make purchases of its common stock from time to time in the open market or privately negotiated transactions, and pursuant to pre-set trading plans meeting the requirements of all applicable securities laws and regulations. The timing and amounts of any such repurchases will depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of the Company’s shares, general market and economic conditions, legal requirements and tax implications. The Company expects to fund the share repurchases using cash on hand.

We have estimated our interest payments on our term loan based on Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate as of the end of fiscal year 2024. Amounts and timing may be different from our estimated interest payments due to potential voluntary prepayments, borrowings and interest rate fluctuations.
(e)
We lease our retail stores, optometric examination offices, distribution centers, office space and all of our optical laboratories with the exception of our St. Cloud, Minnesota lab, which we own. The vast majority of our leases are classified as operating leases under current accounting guidance. Although rent expense on operating leases is recorded in SG&A on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, contractual obligations above represent required cash payments. Our lease arrangements require us to pay executory costs such as insurance, real estate taxes and common area maintenance and some of our leases are based on a percentage of sales. These expenses are generally variable, not included above, and were approximately $37.7 million during fiscal year ended 2024. Refer to Note 10. “Leases” for our current and long-term lease payment obligations.
(f)
For leases classified as finance leases, the finance lease asset is recorded as property and equipment and a corresponding amount is recorded as a long-term debt obligation in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the net present value of the minimum lease payments to be made over the lease term for new finance leases. We allocate each lease payment between a reduction of the lease obligation and interest expense using the effective interest method. Finance lease amounts above represent required contractual cash payments in the periods presented. Refer to Note 10. “Leases” for our current and long-term lease payment obligations.
(g)
Other commitments include minimum purchase commitments with certain trade vendors and contractual agreements to purchase goods or services in the ordinary course of business.
In addition to lease commitments and contractual obligations, our material cash requirements also include operating expenses such as payroll, store rent, and advertising expenses, which we expect to fund primarily with existing cash balances and cash flows from operations.

Table of Contents
We follow U.S. GAAP in making the determination as to whether to record an asset or liability related to our arrangements with third parties. Consistent with current accounting guidance, we do not record an asset or liability associated with long-term purchase, marketing and promotional commitments, or commitments to philanthropic endeavors. We have disclosed the amount of future commitments associated with these items in our consolidated financial statements. We are not a party to any other off-balance sheet arrangements.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Management evaluates the accounting policies, estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.
We have evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related notes and believe those policies to be reasonable and appropriate. Certain of these accounting policies require the application of significant judgment in selecting appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. These judgments are based on historical experience, trends in the industry, information provided by customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. More information on all of our significant accounting policies can be found in Note 1. “Business and Significant Accounting Policies,” to our consolidated financial statements, as well as in certain other notes to the consolidated financial statements as indicated below.

Since an eye exam is a key component in the ability for acceptable prescription eyewear to be delivered to a customer, we concluded that the eye exam service, while capable of being distinct from the eyeglass product delivery, was not distinct in the context of the two-pair offer. As a result, we do not allocate revenue to the eye exam associated with the two-pair offer, and we record all revenue associated with the offer in net product sales when the customer has received and accepted the merchandise.
We recognize revenue across our product protection plan and club membership contract portfolio based on the value delivered to the customers relative to the remaining services promised under the programs. We determine the value delivered based on the expected timing and amount of customer usage of benefits over the terms of the contracts. A 100 basis point change in our estimate of value delivered to customers compared to expected customer usage of benefits would have affected revenues in fiscal year 2024 by approximately $2 million; this amount would have been recognized at different times over the contract period.
Unearned revenue at the end of a reporting period is estimated based on processing and delivery times throughout the current month and generally ranges from approximately seven to ten days. All unearned revenue at the end of a reporting period is recognized in the next fiscal period.
 A one-day increase in our estimate of the average days needed to process delivery would have affected revenues in fiscal year 2024 b
y approximately $4 million, 
which would ultimately have been recorded in the next fiscal year.
The Company considers its revenue from managed care customers to include variable consideration and estimates such amounts associated with managed care customer revenues using the history of concessions provided and cash receipts from managed care providers; a 100 basis point change in our rate of concessions granted would have reduced our revenues in fiscal year 2024 by approximately $2 million.
See Note 9. “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” in our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Impairment of P&E and ROU assets
In evaluating store-level property and equipment and ROU assets for recoverability and impairment, we may consider multiple factors including financial performance of the stores, regional and local business climates, future plans for the store operations and other qualitative factors. We estimate the fair value of the asset group using an income approach based on discounted cash flows, which requires estimates and assumptions of forecasted store revenue growth rates and store profitability. We consider market-based indications of prevailing rental rates, lease incentives and discount rates for retail space when estimating the fair value of ROU assets. Developing the estimates and assumptions used in our recovery and impairment evaluations require significant judgment.

Table of Contents
We had $362.2 million of property and equipment, net, and ROU assets of $408.6 million as of December 28, 2024. Changes in estimates and assumptions used in our impairment testing of property and equipment could result in future impairment losses, which could be material. We recognized impairments of property and equipment and ROU assets of $10.1 million, $2.7 million and $5.5 million in fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Refer to
 Note 11. “Fair Value Measurement” for further information on impairments recognized in fiscal year 2024
.
Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets
We calculate the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach based on discounted cash flows analysis whereby estimated after-tax cash flows are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital. The cash flows used in the analysis are based on financial forecasts developed internally by management and require significant judgment. Significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the reporting units include, but are not limited to, revenue growth rates, costs applicable to revenue, SG&A and discount rates. These assumptions are sensitive to future changes in the business profitability, changes in our business strategy, customer concentration risk and external market conditions, among other factors. See Note 5. “Goodwill and Intangible Assets” for further detail on goodwill impairment. As of December 28, 2024, we had $698.3 million of goodwill, $240.5 million of non-amortizing intangible assets, and $8.3 million of other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization. Changes in estimates and assumptions used in our impairment testing could result in future impairment losses, which could be material. Significant judgments and assumptions are required in our impairment evaluations.
Our America’s Best reporting unit was not at risk of failing the annual goodwill impairment test in fiscal year 2024. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the America’s Best reporting unit would not result in goodwill impairment in fiscal year 2024. As part of the annual goodwill impairment test in fiscal year 2024, the carrying value of the Eyeglass World reporting unit was written down to its estimated fair value, resulting in a $19.2 million impairment charge in fiscal year 2024. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the Company’s Eyeglass World reporting unit would result in additional goodwill impairment of approximately $19 million. Given the recent performance of the Eyeglass World brand, our impairment test reflected assumptions for future revenue growth and profitability that we believe to be achievable; changes to the growth assumptions or future strategy for this brand may negatively affect the fair value of the associated goodwill asset. Future changes in a reporting unit’s business profitability, expected cash flows, changes in business strategy and external market conditions, among other factors, could require us to record an impairment charge for goodwill.
When evaluating indefinite-lived, non-amortizing trademarks and trade names for impairment, we use the relief-from-royalty method to estimate fair value, whereby an estimated royalty rate is determined based on comparable licensing arrangements, which is then applied to the revenue projections for the subject asset. The estimated fair value is calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis. We record an impairment charge as the excess of carrying value over estimated fair value. The fair value of the Eyeglass World trade name asset approximately equals its carrying value; changes to the growth assumptions or future strategy for this brand may negatively affect the fair value of this asset. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in discount rates used to estimate the fair value of the Company’s trademarks and trade names would not result in an impairment of the America’s Best asset, but result in an approximate $5 million impairment of the Eyeglass World asset. A 10 basis point decrease in the royalty rates used in the analyses would not result in an impairment of America’s Best asset, but result in an approximate $5 million impairment of the Eyeglass World asset in fiscal year 2024.
If impairment indicators related to finite-lived, amortizing intangible assets are present, we estimate cash flows expected to be generated over the remaining useful lives of the related assets based on current projections. If the projected net undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the related assets, we then measure impairment based on a discounted cash flow model and record an impairment charge as the excess of carrying value over the estimated fair value. The carrying value of the Fred Meyer contract and relationship intangible asset was written down to its estimated fair value, resulting in a $10.5 million impairment charge in fiscal year 2024. The Fred Meyer impairment testing was performed due to our decision to close certain Fred Meyer stores as part of our fleet review in fiscal year 2024.
Refer to Note 1. “Business and Significant Accounting Policies”, Note 5. “Goodwill and Intangible Assets”, and Note 11. “Fair Value Measurement” for further detail on impairment of goodwill and intangible assets.
Income Taxes
Income tax accounting involves the use of estimates and complex judgments in a number of areas including the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and the evaluation of uncertain tax positions. Our net deferred liability balance as of December 28, 2024 was $77.9 million. As future events, including tax law changes, are unpredictable, we continue to monitor developments in the tax landscape and adjust our assumptions and estimates 
65
Table of Contents
accordingly. Changes in our assumptions and estimates could result in material changes to these balances. See Note 8. “Income Taxes” to our consolidated financial statements.
Inventories
Inventory shrinkage is estimated and recorded throughout the period in cost of sales based on historical results and current inventory levels. Inventory values are adjusted for estimated obsolescence and written down to net realizable value (“NRV”) based on estimates of current and anticipated demand, customer preference, merchandise age, planned promotional activities, compliance with contact lens vendor return policies, and estimates of future retail sales prices. Actual shrinkage is recorded throughout the year based upon periodic physical counts. As of December 28, 2024, our total inventory balance was $93.9 million. A 10% increase in the obsolescence and shrinkage reserves will not have a material impact on our financial position. See Note 1. “Business and Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
For information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 1. “Business and Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We have market risk exposure from changes in interest rates. When appropriate, we may use derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risk from such exposure. A discussion of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in Note 1. “Business and Significant Accounting Policies” and Note 11. “Fair Value Measurement” to our consolidated financial statements.
A significant portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates. If market interest rates increase, the interest rate on our variable rate debt will increase and will create higher debt service requirements, which would adversely affect our cash flow and could adversely impact our results of operations. Our interest rate collar was intended to mitigate some of the effects of increases in interest rates.
As of December 28, 2024, $254.2 million of term loan borrowings were subject to variable interest rates and we had total borrowings of $339.0 million with a weighted average borrowing rate of 6.5%. Our interest rate collar matured on July 18, 2024 and our variable interest rate term loan borrowings are exposed to changes in market rates. An increase or decrease to market rates of 1.0% would result in a $2.5 million increase or decrease to interest expense as of December 28, 2024. See Note 14. “Interest Rate Derivatives”  to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our interest rate collar.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of National Vision Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of National Vision Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 28, 2024, and December 30, 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 28, 2024, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 28, 2024, and December 30, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 28, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 25, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter 
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Goodwill and Trademarks and Trade names — America's Best and Eyeglass World — Refer to Notes 1 and 5 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company tests goodwill and trademarks and trade names for impairment annually, or more frequently as warranted by events or changes in circumstances which indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. The Company evaluates impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit and trademarks and trade names with their respective carrying value. For each reporting unit, the Company used the income approach, which is based on a discounted cash flow analysis and calculated the fair value of the reporting unit by estimating after-tax cash flows discounted using a discount rate. For each trademark and trade name, the Company used the relief-from-royalty method, which involves estimating a royalty rate based on comparable licensing arrangements, applying that rate to revenue projections for the subject asset, and then estimating fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis. The determination of fair value requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to the discount rate for goodwill and trademarks and trade names, and forecasts of costs applicable to revenue and store-level selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) for goodwill. The discount rate may also incorporate certain risk premiums, such as a company-specific risk premium (“CSRP”), which represents the incremental return that investors may require to compensate for risks, uncertainties and variability in the estimated future cash flows. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the 
68
Table of 
C
ontents
fair value which could lead to an impairment charge or an additional impairment charge. As of December 28, 2024, the Company's recorded balance of goodwill was $606.5 million related to America’s Best and $91.8 million related to Eyeglass World. The balance of trademarks and trade names at December 28, 2024 was $40.0 million related to Eyeglass World. The fair value of the reporting unit for America’s Best exceeded the carrying value as of the measurement date, and the fair value of the Eyeglass World trademark and trade name approximately equaled its carrying value; therefore, no impairment was recognized. The carrying value of the Eyeglass World reporting unit was written down to its estimated fair value, resulting in a $19.2 million impairment charge in fiscal year 2024. 
We identified the valuation of the reporting unit for America’s Best and Eyeglass World, and the trademark and trade name for Eyeglass World, as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments made by management to estimate fair value. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions related to the selection of the discount rate, including the CSRP, for the goodwill related to America’s Best and Eyeglass World and trademark and trade name related to Eyeglass World, and the forecasts of costs applicable to revenue and store-level SG&A for the goodwill related to America’s Best and Eyeglass World.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the discount rate, including the CSRP, used by management to estimate the fair value of the reporting units for goodwill and the fair value of the trademark and trade name, and the forecasts of costs applicable to revenue and store-level SG&A used by management to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit for goodwill included the following, among others: 
•
We tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls over management’s impairment evaluation, including those over the determination of the fair value and related to management’s selection of the discount rate, and the forecasts of costs applicable to revenue and store-level SG&A. 
•
We performed a sensitivity analysis of the discount rate, the forecasts of costs applicable to revenue and store-level SG&A, including their impact on future cash flows.
•
We evaluated management's ability to accurately forecast costs applicable to revenue and store-level SG&A and evaluated the reasonableness of these assumptions by comparing management's forecasts for historical periods to actual results for those periods.
•
We evaluated the consistency of estimates and assumptions relating to costs applicable to revenue and store-level SG&A in the discounted cash flow model for the reporting unit to those used by management in other annual forecasting activities. 
•
With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the selected discount rate, including the CSRP, by:
–
Testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rate and the mathematical accuracy of the calculation.
–
Developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rate selected by management.
–
Evaluating the forecasts to understand and sensitize management's assumptions regarding the risk inherent in the forecasts.

Business and Significant Accounting Policies
Nature of Operations
National Vision Holdings, Inc. (“NVHI,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is a holding company whose operating subsidiaries include its indirect wholly owned subsidiary, National Vision, Inc. (“NVI”) and NVI’s direct wholly owned subsidiaries. We are a leading value retailer of eyeglasses and contact lenses in the United States (“U.S”). We operated 
1,240
 and 
1,188
 retail optical locations in the U.S. and its territories as of the fiscal years ended December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively, through our 
four
 store brands, including America’s Best Contacts and Eyeglasses (“America’s Best”), Eyeglass World, Vista Optical locations on select U.S. Army/Air Force military bases (“Military”) and within select Fred Meyer stores. We also operate omni-channel websites for our America’s Best, Eyeglass World and Military brands, as well as a dedicated e-commerce website.
We operated 
225
 stores for Walmart Inc. (“Walmart”) as of December 30, 2023; these stores are not reflected in the store counts above and the operating results of these stores are presented as discontinued operations. Also presented in discontinued operations are the majority of the operations formerly conducted by the Company’s Arlington Contact Lens (“AC Lens”) subsidiary, which sold eyeglasses, contact lenses and optical accessory products to retail customers through various websites, and distributed contact lenses to Walmart and Sam’s Club store locations. Refer to Note 2. “Discontinued Operations” for more information. 
We also operate a specialized health maintenance organization (“HMO”) that is licensed as a single-service health plan under California law. The HMO issues individual vision plans in connection with our America’s Best operations in California.
Fiscal Year
We operate on a retail fiscal calendar that results in a given fiscal year consisting of a 52-week or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to December 31. In a 52-week fiscal year, each quarter contains 13 weeks of operations; in a 53-week fiscal year, each of the first, second and third quarters include 13 weeks of operations and the fourth quarter includes 14 weeks of operations.
References herein to “fiscal year 2024”, “fiscal year 2023” and “fiscal year 2022,” relate to the 52 weeks ended December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. Unless otherwise stated, references to years in this report relate to fiscal years rather than calendar years.
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our subsidiaries, all of which are wholly-owned. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain amounts within the consolidated financial statements and footnotes to the financial statements for fiscal year 2023 and fiscal year 2022 have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal year 2024 presentation. Retrospective reclassifications have been made to prior period financial statements and disclosures to present the discontinued operations. Refer to Note 2. “Discontinued Operations” for more information on discontinued operations.
The Company has consolidated certain entities meeting the definition of a variable interest entity (“VIE”) as the Company concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the entities under the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification 810, Consolidation.
 As of December 28, 2024, the variable interest entities include 
29
 professional corporations. The total assets of the consolidated VIEs included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, were $
7.0
 million and $
8.3
 million, respectively, and the total liabilities of the consolidated VIEs were $
8.4
 million and $
9.8
 million, respectively.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Share Repurchases
Effective November 8, 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) authorized the Company to repurchase up to $
50
 million aggregate amount of shares of the Company's common stock. On November 29, 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized an increase from $
50
 million to $
100
 million in aggregate amount of shares of the Company’s common stock that may be repurchased under the Company’s current share repurchase program. On February 23, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a $
100
 million increase to the share repurchase authorization, for a total authorization of $
200
 million. The Company’s original share repurchase authorization expired on December 30, 2023, and had remaining capacity of $
25
 million. Effective February 23, 2024, the Board authorized the Company to repurchase up to $
50
 million aggregate amount of shares of the Company’s common stock until January 3, 2026. As of December 28, 2024, $
50
 million remains available under the share repurchase authorization. During fiscal years 2023 and 2022, the Company repurchased 
1.1
 million shares of its common stock for $
25
 million and 
2.7
 million shares of its common stock for $
80
 million, respectively, under the share repurchase program. The authorization permits the Company to make purchases of its common stock from time to time in the open market or privately negotiated transactions, and pursuant to pre-set trading plans meeting the requirements of all applicable securities laws and regulations. The timing and amounts of any such repurchases will depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of the Company’s shares, general market and economic conditions, legal requirements and tax implications. The Company expects to fund the share repurchases using cash on hand. Repurchased shares are reflected in Treasury stock on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
CARES Act
On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act, among other things, accelerates a company’s ability to recover Alternative Minimum Tax (“AMT”) refundable credits that otherwise could have been claimed in 2020 and 2021, to 2018 and 2019, with an option to elect recovery of the full credit amount for 2018. The Company recognizes government grants for which there is a reasonable assurance of compliance with grant conditions and receipt of credits. Amounts receivable under the 
CARES Act
 were $
9.0
 million as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023. Credits recognized under the CARES Act offset deferred payroll taxes that would otherwise be payable as of January 1, 2022.
In addition to the CARES Act, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, H.R. 133 was signed into law on December 27, 2020 and, among other things, allows for 100% deductibility of meals and entertainment expenses for the tax years ended 2022 and 2021. In 2023, the deductibility was reduced to 50% of meals and 0% of entertainment expenses.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash consists of currency and demand deposits with financial institutions and money market funds. We consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. We also review cash balances on a bank by bank basis to identify book overdrafts. Book overdrafts occur when the amount of outstanding checks exceed the cash deposited at a bank. We reclassify book overdrafts, if any, to Accounts payable in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Accounts Receivable, Net
Accounts receivable associated with revenues consist primarily of trade receivables and credit card receivables. Trade receivables consist primarily of receivables from managed care payors. While we have relationships with almost all vision care insurers in the U.S. and with all of the major carriers, currently, a relatively small number of payors comprise the majority of our managed care revenues, subjecting us to concentration risk. Accounts receivable are reduced by allowances for credit losses. Estimates of our allowance for credit losses are based on our historical and current operating, billing, and collection trends, as well as current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future. Accounts receivable are written off after all collection attempts have been exhausted. Credit loss expense recognized on our receivables, which is presented in SG&A expenses in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations, was approximately

$
0.4
 million, $
0.6
 million and $
0.8
 million for the fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Inventories
The cost of inventory is determined using the weighted average cost method. Inventories at retail stores consist of finished goods and are valued at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value (“NRV”). Manufactured inventories are valued using absorption accounting which includes material, labor, other variable costs and other applicable manufacturing overhead. Inventory values are adjusted for estimated obsolescence and written down to NRV based on estimates of current and anticipated demand, customer preference, merchandise age, planned promotional activities, contact lens vendor return acceptance activity, and estimates of future retail sales prices. 
76
Table of Contents
Shrinkage is estimated and recorded throughout the period in costs applicable to revenue based on historical results and current inventory levels. Actual shrinkage is recorded throughout the year based upon periodic physical counts.
 See Note 4. “Details of Certain Balance Sheet Accounts” for further details.
The Company’s inventory consists primarily of eyeglass frames, contact lenses, and unprocessed eyeglass lenses. A significant portion of our inventory is supplied by a small number of key vendors. During fiscal year 2024, approximately 
94
% of contact lens expenditures were with three vendors and approximately 
82
% of lens expenditures were with one vendor. This exposes us to vendor concentration risk. We are less exposed to a supplier risk for our eyeglass frames as only approximately 
54
% of frame expenditures were with two vendors.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment (“P&E”) is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation associated with P&E is included in Depreciation and amortization in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. When we retire or otherwise dispose of P&E, we remove the cost and related accumulated depreciation from our accounts and recognize any gain or loss on the sale of such assets in SG&A in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income. We capitalize major replacements and remodeling, and recognize expenditures for maintenance and repairs in SG&A.
We depreciate P&E for financial accounting purposes using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:

____________
(a)
Costs of developing or obtaining software for internal use, such as direct costs of materials or services and internal payroll costs related to the software development projects, are capitalized to information technology hardware and software. 
(b)
Depreciation of leasehold improvements is recognized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the term of the lease. The term of the lease includes renewal options for additional periods if the exercise of the renewal is considered to be reasonably assured.
Cloud Computing Arrangements
The Company capitalizes certain costs related to the acquisition and development of internal use software, including implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement during the application development stages of projects. Capitalized implementation costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected term of the hosting arrangement, which includes consideration of the non-cancellable contractual term and reasonably certain renewals. Costs incurred during the preliminary project or the post-implementation stages of the project are expensed as incurred. Implementation costs are included in Other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amortization of capitalized implementation costs is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Indefinite-lived intangible assets include goodwill and our trademarks and tradenames; we evaluate these assets annually for impairment, or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill or intangible assets are impaired. Our annual testing date for impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets is the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter, which for fiscal year 2024 was September 29, 2024. Costs to renew intangible assets are expensed as incurred.
Goodwill is impaired if a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, and impairment is calculated as the excess between carrying value over fair value. We consider each of our operating segments to be reporting units. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach, which is based on a discounted cash flow analysis and involves estimating after-tax cash flows that are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital that considers both market risk and company-specific risk. The cash flows used in the analysis are based on financial forecasts developed internally by management and require significant judgment. Significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the reporting units include, but are not limited to, revenue growth rates, costs applicable to revenue, SG&A and discount rates. These assumptions are sensitive to future changes in the business profitability, changes in our business strategy and external market conditions, among other factors. A decrease to the 
77
Table of Contents
long-term revenue growth rate assumption or an increase to the expense growth rate assumptions could require us to record goodwill impairment charges.
We use the relief-from-royalty method to estimate fair value of our trademarks and trade names, which involves estimating a royalty rate based on comparable licensing arrangements, applying that rate to the revenue projections for the subject asset, and then estimating fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis; the discounted cash flow analysis uses a weighted average cost of capital that considers both market risk and company-specific risk. We record an impairment charge as the excess of carrying value over estimated fair value.
Finite-lived, amortizing intangible assets primarily consist of our Fred Meyer contracts and relationship. We amortize finite-lived intangible assets on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Amortization expense associated with finite-lived intangible assets is included in Depreciation and amortization in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.
If impairment indicators related to amortizing intangible assets are present, we estimate cash flows expected to be generated over the remaining useful lives of the related assets based on current projections. If the projected net undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the related assets, we then measure impairment based on a discounted cash flow model and record an impairment charge as the excess of carrying value over estimated fair value.
See Note 2. “Discontinued Operations”, Note 5. “Goodwill and Intangible Assets”, and Note 11. “Fair Value Measurement” for further detail on impairment of goodwill and intangible assets.
Investments

In the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, we completed an investment in an entity specializing in applying artificial intelligence-powered screening and diagnostic tools to retinal imaging. During fiscal year 2024 and 2023, we invested $
1.5
 million and $
1.8
 million, respectively. The investment is valued at cost. In fiscal year 2024, we completed an investment in a convertible promissory note issued by this entity. The investments are recognized in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and in Other in the investing section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for fiscal years fiscal years 2024 and 2023.  Refer to 
Note 11. “Fair Value Measurement” for more information on the promissory note.
We previously had an investment in an entity that was acquired by a third party in fiscal year 2021. We received $
2.7
 million in fiscal year 2022 related to an earnout associated with the sale. These proceeds were reflected in Other expense (income), net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income and in Other in the investing section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Fair Value Measurement of Assets and Liabilities
The Company accounts for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The Company generally uses a market approach, when practicable, in valuing financial instruments. For certain assets the Company may also use a valuation technique consistent with the income approach whereby future cash flows are converted to a single discounted amount. The carrying value of the Company’s cash equivalents and restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other payables and accrued expenses, approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. 
Non-financial assets such as P&E, right of use (“ROU”) assets and intangible assets are subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements if impairment indicators are present. Factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include a significant under-performance compared to expected operating results, a significant or adverse change in customer business climate, and a significant negative industry or economic trend.
Refer to “Long-lived Asset Impairment” section below and Note 11. “Fair Value Measurement” for the Company’s recurring and non-recurring fair value measurements.
Deferred Financing Costs and Loan Discounts
Costs incurred in connection with long-term debt which are paid directly to the Company’s lenders and to third parties are presented as reductions to our long-term debt balance, except for the costs related to our revolving credit facility which are presented as assets. These costs are amortized over the term of the related financing agreement and included in Interest expense, net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Self-Insurance Liabilities
We are primarily self-insured for workers’ compensation, associate health benefits and general liability claims. We record self-insurance liabilities based on claims filed, including the development of those claims and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Should a different amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated, or costs of the claims increase or decrease beyond what was anticipated, liabilities may need to be adjusted 
78
Table of Contents
accordingly. We periodically update our estimates and record such adjustments in the period in which such determination is made. Self-insurance liabilities are recorded on an undiscounted basis in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to the following table and Note 4. “Details of Certain Balance Sheet Accounts” for further details.
We reinsure worker’s compensation and medical claims above our retention levels with a highly rated financial institution that can be expected to fully perform under the terms of the arrangement. 
Estimated recoveries from reinsurance as of fiscal year end 2024 and 2023 are shown in the following table.

Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company has used interest rate derivatives to manage the exposure of its Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“Term SOFR”)-based debt to fluctuations in interest rates. If our derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges, we formally document our hedge relationships, including identification of the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transactions. We record all interest rate derivatives in our Consolidated Balance Sheets on a gross basis at fair value. Fair value represents estimated amounts we would receive or pay upon a termination of interest rate derivatives prior to their scheduled expiration dates. The fair value is based on information that is model-driven and whose inputs were observable (Level 2 inputs) such as Term SOFR forward rates. We do not hold or enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
The gain or loss res
ulting from fair value adjustments for highly effective cash flow hedges is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss (“AOCL”) in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets until the hedged item is recognized as Interest expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The gain or loss resulting from fair value adjustments of derivatives not deemed to be highly effective cash flow hedges is recognized in Interest expense, net immediately. We 
perform periodic assessments of the effectiveness of our derivative contracts designated as hedges, if applicable.
To manage credit risk associated with our interest rate hedging program, we select as counterparties major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. The impact of credit risk, as well as the ability of each party to fulfill its obligations under our derivative financial instruments, is considered in determining the fair value of the contracts. We were party to an interest rate collar to offset the variability of cash flows in Term SOFR-indexed debt interest payments. The interest rate collar matured on July 18, 2024.
 See Note 14. “Interest Rate Derivatives” for further details.
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss
AOCL is defined as the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of income tax, is entirely composed of the cumulative unrealized loss on our previously effective hedging instruments.
 See Note 17. “Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss” for details of reclassifications out of AOCL.
Revenue Recognition 
Net product sales include sales of prescription and non-prescription eyewear, contact lenses and related accessories to retail customers (including those covered by managed care). Net sales of services and plans include sales of eye exams, eye care club membership fees, product protection plans (i.e. warranties) and HMO vision plan fees. 
At our America’s Best brand, our signature offer is two pairs of eyeglasses and a free eye exam for one low price (“two-pair offer”). Since an eye exam is a key component in the ability for acceptable prescription eyewear to be delivered to a customer, we concluded that the eye exam service, while capable of being distinct from the eyeglass product delivery, was not distinct in the context of the two-pair offer. As a result, we do not allocate revenue to the eye exam associated with the two-pair offer, and we record all revenue associated with the offer in Owned & Host net product sales when the customer has received and accepted the merchandise.
79
Table of Contents
Our retail customers generally make payments for prescription eyewear products at the time they place an order. Amounts we collect in advance for undelivered merchandise are reported as Unearned revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unearned revenue at the end of a reporting period is estimated based on processing and delivery times throughout the current month which generally range from approximately 
seven
 to 
10
 days; all unearned revenue at the end of a reporting period is recognized in the next fiscal period.
Revenue is recognized net of sales taxes and returns and includes amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling costs. The returns allowance is based on historical return patterns. Provisions for estimated returns are established and the expected costs continue to be recognized as reductions to revenue when the products are sold. Shipping and handling costs are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in costs applicable to revenue.
An increasing percentage of our customers receive vision insurance coverage through managed care payors. These payors represent an increasingly significant portion of our overall revenues and our revenue growth and represented approximately 
40
% of our revenues from continuing operations in fiscal year 2024.
We record reductions in revenue for estimated price concessions granted to managed care providers.

The Company considers its revenue from managed care customers to include variable consideration and estimates such amounts associated with managed care customer revenues using the history of concessions provided and cash receipts from managed care providers.
 We reduced our net revenue for variable considerations of $
17.7
 million, $
14.7
 million and $
13.0
 million during the fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Refer to Note 9. “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” for further details of our revenues.
Costs Applicable to Revenue
Costs applicable to revenue consist primarily of cost of products sold and costs of administering services and plans.  Costs of products sold include (i) costs to procure non-prescription eyewear, contacts and accessories which we purchase and sell in their finished form, (ii) costs to manufacture finished prescription eyeglasses, including direct materials, labor and overhead and (iii) remake costs, warehousing and distribution expenses and internal transfer costs. Costs of services and plans include costs associated with warranty programs, eye care club memberships, HMO vision plan fees, eye care practitioner and eye exam technician payroll, taxes and benefits and optometric and other service costs. Depreciation and amortization are excluded from costs applicable to revenue and are presented separately on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income.
As a component of the Company’s procurement program, the Company frequently enters into contracts with its vendors that provide for payments of rebates or other allowances. These vendor payments are reflected when earned or as progress is made toward earning the rebate or allowance and, depending on the terms of the agreement with the vendor, are treated as a reduction of the carrying value of the inventory and a resultant reduction of cost of products. Rebates that have been earned but not yet received are recognized as an increase to Accounts receivable, net or a reduction to Accounts payable, depending on the nature of the agreement with the vendor, until the payment has been received.
Selling, General and Administrative
SG&A includes store associate (including optician) payroll, taxes and benefits, occupancy and other store expenses, advertising and promotion, field services, and corporate support. Advertising and promotion costs, including online marketing arrangements, newspaper, direct mail, television and radio, are recorded in SG&A and expensed at the time the advertising first occurs. Production costs of future media advertising and related promotional campaigns are deferred until the advertising events occur. Non-capital expenditures associated with opening new stores, including rent, marketing expenses, travel and relocation costs, and training costs, are recorded in SG&A as incurred. Certain vendor contracts provide for marketing co-op allowances; such allowances are reflected when earned or as progress is made toward earning the allowance and are treated as a reduction of SG&A.
Advertising expenses were $
138.6
 million, $
137.2
 million and $
138.5
 million for fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Leases
We lease our stores, distribution center, corporate offices, and most of our laboratories. These leases generally have noncancelable lease terms of between 
five
 and 
10
 years, with an option to renew for additional terms of 
one
 to 
10
 years or more. The lease term includes renewal option periods when the renewal is deemed reasonably certain after considering the value of the leasehold improvements at the end of the noncancelable lease period. Most leases for our stores provide for a minimum rent and typically include escalating rent over time with the exception of Military for which lease payments are variable and based on a percentage of sales. For Vista Optical locations in Fred Meyer stores, we pay the greater of fixed rent or a percentage of sales after certain minimum thresholds are achieved. The Company’s leases generally require us to pay insurance, real estate taxes and common area maintenance expenses, 
80
Table of Contents
substantially all of which are variable and not included in the measurement of the lease liability. Our lease arrangements frequently include tenant improvement allowances (“TIAs”), which are contractual amounts received or receivable from a lessor for improvements made to leased properties by the Company. For operating leases, TIAs are treated as a reduction of the lease payments used to measure the ROU assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and are amortized as a reduction in rental expense over the life of the respective leases. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. 
The lease liability is measured at the present value of future lease payments over the lease term less TIAs receivable, and the ROU asset is measured at the lease liability amount, adjusted for prepaid lease payments, TIAs received and the lessee’s initial direct costs. As the rate implicit in the Company’s leases is not easily determinable, the Company’s incremental borrowing rate is used in calculating the present value of the sum of the lease payments. Factors incorporated into the calculation of the lease incremental borrowing rate include lease term, borrowing rates on the Company’s long-term debt, Term SOFR margins for issuers of similar credit rating to NVI and effect of collateralization.
For finance leases, a lease ROU asset is recorded as property and equipment and corresponding amounts are recorded as finance lease debt obligations at the net present value of the minimum lease payments to be made over the lease term for new finance leases.

Stock-Based Compensation
We measure stock-based compensation cost, which consists of grants of stock options, performance stock units (“PSUs”), and restricted stock units (“RSUs”), to associates and non-employee directors, based on the estimated grant date fair value of the awards. We recognize compensation expense for all awards containing only a service requirement over the requisite service period using a straight-line recognition method. Our PSUs contain both a service requirement and a performance requirement. We recognize expense for the proportionate share of the total fair value of PSUs related to the vesting period that has already lapsed for the shares expected to vest, which expectation is based on an evaluation of expected performance against predefined performance criteria and may also result in reversals of expense. The remaining fair value of the shares expected to vest is expensed on a straight-line basis over the balance of the vesting period. We account for forfeitures as they occur.
 See Note 7. “Stock Incentive Plan” for further details related to our stock-based compensation plans.
Long-lived Asset Impairment
Non-financial assets such as P&E, ROU assets and intangible assets are subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements if impairment indicators are present. We evaluate impairment of long-lived tangible and ROU store assets at the store level, which is the lowest level at which independent cash flows can be identified, when events or conditions indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. In making this evaluation, we may consider multiple factors including financial performance of the stores, regional and local business climates, industry or economic trends, future plans for the store operations and other qualitative factors. If the store’s projected undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets over the life of the primary asset within the asset group are less than the carrying value of the subject assets, we determine an estimate of the fair value of the asset group using an income approach based on discounted cash flows, which require estimates and assumptions related to forecasted store revenue growth rates and store profitability. If the fair value of the asset group is less than its carrying value, the loss is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts of those assets, except that the loss allocated to an individual long lived asset of the group shall not reduce the carrying amount of that asset below its fair value. We consider market-based indications of prevailing rental rates for retail space, market participant discount rates, and lease incentives when estimating the fair values of ROU assets.
We assess non-store long-lived assets, including capitalized software costs in use or under development, for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable.

Store fleet review
During fiscal year 2024, we completed a comprehensive store fleet review and decided on actions to address identified stores. As a result of this review, we announced plans to close 
39
 stores and convert 
four
 Eyeglass Word stores into America’s Best stores. As of December 28, 2024, 
12
 of these locations were closed and 
four
 Eyeglass Word stores were converted into America’s Best stores. Total costs incurred as a result of the store fleet review were immaterial for fiscal year 2024 due to severance and other charges being offset by non-cash gains related to remeasurements of store leases. Substantially all of the costs were recognized in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income.
81
Table of Contents
During fiscal year 2024, we recognized $
10.5
 million of non-cash intangible asset impairment and $
4.3
 million of non-cash tangible long-lived and ROU asset impairment related to the stores we planned to close as part of the store fleet review. Both charges were recognized in Asset impairment in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income. Refer to Note 5. Goodwill and Intangible Assets and Note 11. “Fair Value Measurement” for additional information on the impairment charges.
All costs incurred related to the store fleet review were recognized in the corporate and other category. Liabilities related to this plan are recorded in Other payables and accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Discontinued Operations
In accordance with ASC 205-20 “Presentation of Financial Statements: Discontinued Operations,” a disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity is required to be reported as discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results. In the period in which the component meets held-for-sale or discontinued operations criteria, the major current assets, non-current assets, current liabilities, and non-current liabilities shall be reported as components of total assets and liabilities separate from those balances of the continuing operations.
Our operations related to Walmart, including our former Legacy reportable segment, as well as the majority of our AC Lens operations, met the requirements to be classified as discontinued operations. Accordingly, we classified the results of these operations as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income for all periods presented. The results of all discontinued operations, less applicable income taxes, are reported as components of net income separate from the net income of continuing operations, and certain assets and liabilities associated with these operations were classified as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the periods presented. Additionally, the cash flows and comprehensive (loss) income of discontinued operations have not been segregated and are included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income, respectively, for all periods presented.
 All amounts included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements relate to continuing operations unless otherwise noted. For additional information, see Note 2. “Discontinued Operations.”
Income Taxes
We account for deferred income taxes based on the asset and liability method. The Company must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense. We are required to determine the aggregate amount of income tax expense to accrue and the amount which will be currently payable or refundable based upon tax statutes of each jurisdiction in which the Company does business. Deferred income taxes are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets also include future tax benefits to be derived from the utilization of tax loss carry-forwards and application of certain carry-forward credits. The net carrying amount of deferred income tax assets and liabilities is recorded in noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Deferred income taxes are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes from a change in the tax rate is recognized through continuing operations in the period that includes the enactment of the change. Changes in tax laws and rates could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future.
A valuation allowance is recorded if it is more likely than not that some portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Valuation allowances are released as positive evidence of future taxable income sufficient to realize the underlying deferred tax assets becomes available.
We establish a liability for tax positions for which there is uncertainty as to whether the position will ultimately be sustained. We assess our tax positions by determining whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based solely on the technical merits of the position. These calculations and assessments involve estimates and judgments because the ultimate tax outcomes are uncertain and future events are unpredictable.
 See Note 8. “Income Taxes” for further details.
Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements
Segment reporting.
 In November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
. This update provides, among other things, enhanced segment disclosure requirements including disclosures about significant segment expenses. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years 
82
Table of Contents
beginning after December 15, 2024, and requires retrospective application to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 and has provided the applicable disclosures in. Note 16. “Segment Reporting.”
Future Adoption of Accounting Pronouncements
Income taxes.
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
 (“ASU 2023-09”). ASU 2023-09 is intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in ASU 2023-09 address investor requests for enhanced income tax information primarily through changes to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2025. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the guidance on the consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
Expense Disaggregation Disclosures.
 In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, 
Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive (Loss) Income (Topic 220-40): Expense Disaggregation Disclosures
 (“ASU 2024-03”). This update requires, among other things, more detailed disclosure about types of expenses in commonly presented expense captions such as cost of sales and SG&A, and is intended to improve the disclosures about an entity’s expenses including purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation and amortization. ASU 2024-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the guidance on the consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
Induced Conversions of Convertible Debt Instruments.
 In November 2024, FASB issued ASU 2024-04, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20): Induced Conversions of Convertible Debt Instruments, which clarifies the requirements for determining whether certain settlements of convertible debt instruments should be accounted for as an induced conversion or extinguishment of convertible debt. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2025, and interim periods within those annual reporting periods, with early and retrospective adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the guidance on the consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
The FASB issued other accounting guidance during fiscal year 2024 that is not currently applicable or expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements, and therefore, is not described above.
2. 
Discontinued Operations
On July 20, 2023, the Company received a notice of non-renewal from Walmart of the Management & Services Agreement by and between NVI and Walmart, dated as of May 1, 2012 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Walmart MSA”). In accordance with the terms of the Walmart MSA and the notice, the agreement terminated as of February 23, 2024 (the “Termination Date”). In connection with the termination of the Walmart MSA, the Amended and Restated Supplier Agreement between NVI and Walmart, dated as of January 17, 2017; the agreement between FirstSight Vision Services, Inc. (“FirstSight”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and Walmart, which arranged for the provision by FirstSight of optometric services at optometric offices next to certain Walmart stores throughout California; and certain other related agreements also terminated as of the Termination Date. The Walmart MSA includes provisions governing the transition period and post-termination obligations of the parties.
AC Lens delivered notices of non-renewal of the agreements it has with Walmart and its affiliate Sam’s Club regarding wholesale contact lenses distribution and related services, such that these agreements terminated during the three months ended June 29, 2024, and the Company wound down the majority of AC Lens operations, including the closure of its Ohio distribution center, which largely supported the wholesale distribution and e-commerce contact lens services that the Company provided to Walmart and Sam’s Club.
We determined that the various terminations of agreements described above as well as the subsequent decision to consolidate our distribution network and close the distribution center in Ohio constituted triggering events, and accordingly, we recognized impairment charges during the year ended December 30, 2023, consisting primarily of goodwill impairment of our former Legacy segment.
During fiscal year 2024 and 2023, we recorded $
4.4
 million and $
5.2
 million, respectively, of net expense associated with the termination of the Walmart MSA and wind down of AC Lens, which consisted of employee compensation benefits, early termination fees, and other exit related costs. These charges were recorded in both Selling, general, and administrative expenses and Costs applicable to revenue for discontinued operations. The plan has been substantially completed and we do not anticipate additional material costs related to this plan.
83
Table of Contents
As a result of the termination of the Walmart MSA and wind down of AC Lens operations, our former Legacy reportable segment and certain other results previously included in corporate and other as well as related effects of unearned and deferred revenue, met the criteria to be presented as discontinued operations. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities and results of operations of the discontinued operations have been presented in the tables below.
Refer to Note 3. “Details of Cost Savings Plan” for more information on the cost savings plan related to our continuing operations.
Major classes of assets and liabilities related to discontinued operations are presented in the table below. We have retained working capital and deferred tax balances related to discontinued operations; consequently, these items are not part of the disposal group.

Details of Cost Savings Plan
In connection with the discontinued operations, the Company implemented a cost savings plan that included optimizing non-customer facing labor costs, as well as reducing travel expenses and third-party spend. We have incurred $
1.9
 million since the inception of the cost savings plan, which is included within our continuing operations results. The plan has been substantially completed and we do not anticipate additional material costs related to this plan. 
The liability related to this plan is recorded in Other payables and accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the remaining payments related to this liability were made after December 28, 2024. This disclosure excludes the impact of the Walmart partnership termination and wind down of AC Lens operations, which are currently presented under discontinued operations.

2025 Notes
In May 2020, we completed the issuance of $
402.5
 million in aggregate principal amount of 
2.50
% convertible senior notes due on May 15, 2025 (the “2025 Notes”), pursuant to an indenture between the Company and U.S. Bank, dated as of May 12, 2020 (the “Indenture”). The 2025 Notes were sold only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The 2025 Notes pay interest semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing on November 15, 2020, at an annual rate of 
2.50
%.
We received proceeds from the offering of $
390.9
 million, net of $
11.6
 million in underwriter fees and other issuance costs. We used $
294.3
 million of the net proceeds from the offering to repay all outstanding amounts under the revolving credit facility and $
75.0
 million to partially repay the first lien term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $
420.0
 million (the “term loan”). The remainder of the net proceeds are being used for general corporate purposes. 
Prior to February 15, 2025, the 2025 Notes were convertible at the option of the holders only under certain circumstances, which were not attained:
(i) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2020 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the Last Reported Sale Price (as defined in the Indenture) per share of the Company’s common stock exceeded 
130
% of the Conversion Price (as defined in the Indenture) for each of at least 
20
 Trading Days (as defined in the Indenture), whether or not consecutive, during the 
30
 consecutive Trading Days ending on, and including, the last Trading Day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; 
88
Table of Contents
(ii) during the 
five
 consecutive business days immediately after any 
ten
 consecutive Trading Day period (such 
ten
 consecutive trading day period, the “measurement period”) in which the Trading Price (as defined in the Indenture) per $
1,000
 principal amount of the 2025 Notes for each Trading Day of the measurement period was less than 
98
% of the product of the Last Reported Sale Price per share of the Company’s common stock on such Trading Day and the conversion rate (as described below) on such Trading Day; or
(iii) upon the occurrence of certain corporate events or distributions on the Company’s common stock, as described in the Indenture.
On or after February 15, 2025, until 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the second Scheduled Trading Day (as defined in the Indenture) immediately before the maturity date, the 2025 Notes are convertible at the option of the holders at any time, into cash up to the amount of $1,000, with any excess amount convertible into shares, based on the applicable conversion rate at such time. 
The 2025 Notes were initially convertible at a conversion rate of 32.0783 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2025 Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $
31.17
 per share of common stock. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events including, but not limited to: issuance of stock dividends, splits and combinations; distribution of rights, options and warrants; spin-offs and other distributed property; cash dividends or distributions; tender offers or exchange offers; and certain other corporate transactions. Based on the initial conversion rate, the 2025 Notes were convertible into 
12.9
 million shares of our common stock and we reserved for the possible issuance of 
16.5
 million shares, which is the maximum amount that could be issued upon conversion. As of December 28, 2024, the 2025 Notes were convertible into 
2.7
 million shares of our common stock and a maximum of 
3.5
 million shares of our common stock. See Note 15. “Earnings Per Share” for the treatment of earnings per share in relation to the 2025 Notes. The holders of our term loan would have preference over the holders of the 2025 Notes in the event of a liquidation. 
On November 14, 2023, the Company repurchased $
100.0
 million aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes for an aggregate cash repurchase price of $
99.3
 million. The repurchase of the 2025 Notes was accounted for as an extinguishment of debt and resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $
0.6
 million on its Consolidated Statement of Operations during fiscal year ended December 30, 2023, which includes a write-off of related deferred issuance costs of $
0.9
 million and third-party fees of $
0.4
 million. Our effective interest rate remained at 
3.2
% as of December 28, 2024. An immaterial amount of the principal balance of the 2025 Notes was converted during fiscal year 2022.
On August 12, 2024, the Company repurchased $
217.7
 million aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes for an aggregate cash repurchase price of $
215.0
 million plus accrued and unpaid interest on such notes. The repurchase was accounted for as an extinguishment of debt and resulted in an extinguishment gain of $
0.9
 million on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations during the twelve months ended December 28, 2024, which includes a write-off of related deferred issuance costs of $
1.0
 million and immediate recognition of third party-fees of $
0.8
 million.
The 2025 Notes mature on May 15, 2025, and due to the upcoming maturity the outstanding principal balance of $
84.8
 million is reflected as a current liability in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 28, 2024. As of December 28, 2024, the Company has $
293.6
 million of availability under its revolving credit facility, in addition to $
73.9
 million of cash on hand, which provides the Company with sufficient liquidity to repay the remaining balance of the 2025 Notes as they become due. 
After giving effect to the repurchases, $
84.8
 million principal amount remains outstanding from an initial issued principal balance of $
402.5
 million.

Credit Agreement
Reference is made to (i) that certain Second Joinder and Restatement Agreement, dated as of June 13, 2023 (the “Second Restatement Agreement”), by and among the New Lenders party thereto, the Letter of Credit Issuers party thereto, Nautilus Acquisition Holdings, Inc. (“Holdings”), a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of 
89
Table of Contents
the Company, NVI, the subsidiaries of NVI party thereto, as guarantors, Bank of America, N.A. in its capacity as administrative agent and as collateral agent and (ii) the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of June 13, 2023 (the “Credit Agreement”).
On June 13, 2023 (the “Second Restatement Effective Date”), the Second Restatement Agreement amended and restated the Joinder and Amendment and Restatement Agreement, dated as of July 18, 2019 (as amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified prior to the Second Restatement Agreement, the “Original Credit Agreement”) to, among other things, (i) establish new Term Loan A to repay all principal, interest, fees and other amounts outstanding (other than contingent obligations) under the Original Credit Agreement immediately prior to the Second Restatement Effective Date, (ii) establish new Revolving Loans, (iii) provide for a Secured Overnight Financing Rate as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (or a successor administrator) (“SOFR”)-based rate, with a credit spread adjustment of 
10
 basis points for all Interest Periods and a SOFR floor of 
0.00
% per annum, and (iv) as set forth below, modify the Applicable Margins used to calculate the rate of interest payable with respect to the Term Loan A and Revolving Loans (collectively, the “Loans”).
The Credit Agreement, as amended by the Second Restatement Agreement, provides that the Loans mature on the fifth anniversary of the Second Restatement Effective Date, subject to a springing maturity date, which is 
91
 days before the maturity date of the Company’s 2025 Notes if Minimum Liquidity is less than the sum of the redemption value of such convertible notes on that date plus $
25.0
 million (the “Maturity Date”). Commencing on the last day of the first full fiscal quarter ended after the Second Restatement Effective Date, the Term Loan A will amortize in equal calendar quarterly installments at a rate of 
5.00
% per calendar year. The $
114.4
 million balance (assuming the springing maturity date does not occur) will be payable on the Maturity Date.
The new Applicable Margins were initially (i) 
1.75
% for the Loans that are Term SOFR Loans and (ii) 
0.75
% for the Loans that are Alternative Base Rate (“ABR”) Loans. Following the delivery of the financial statements for the period ending on September 30, 2023, the Applicable Margins for the Loans will instead be based on NVI’s total leverage ratio as follows: (a) if NVI’s consolidated total debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio is greater than 
2.50
 to 1.00, the Applicable Margin will be 
2.25
% for Term SOFR Loans and 
1.25
% for ABR Loans, (b) if NVI’s consolidated total debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio is less than or equal to 
2.50
 to 1.00 but greater than 
1.75
 to 1.00, the Applicable Margin will be 
2.00
% for Term SOFR Loans and 
1.00
% for ABR Loans, (c) if NVI’s consolidated total debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio is less than or equal to 
1.75
 to 1.00 but greater than 
0.75
 to 1.00, the Applicable Margin will be 
1.75
% for Term SOFR Loans and 
0.75
% for ABR Loans, (d) if NVI’s consolidated total debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio is less than or equal to 
0.75
 to 1.00, the Applicable Margin will be 
1.50
% for Term SOFR Loans and 
0.50
% for ABR Loans.
In connection with the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, we deferred $
2.0
 million of debt issuance costs related to the Revolving Loans in Other assets and $
0.9
 million of debt issuance costs related to the Term Loan A in Long-term debt and finance lease obligations, less current portion and debt discount on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We will amortize these costs over the term of the amended credit agreement. We wrote off previously unamortized debt issuance costs of $
0.2
 million in Interest expense (income), net during fiscal year 2023 related to lenders who were parties to the Original Credit Agreement but are not parties to the Second Restatement Agreement. We recognized $
0.2
 million of other refinancing fees in Interest expense (income), net during fiscal year 2023.
On August 9, 2024, Holdings, NVI and certain other subsidiaries of the Company entered into a Joinder Agreement (the “Joinder Agreement”) to the Credit Agreement. The Joinder Agreement provides for, among other things, the establishment of incremental term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $
115.0
 million, provided to NVI on August 9, 2024. These incremental term loans under the Joinder Agreement have the same terms as the existing term loans under the Credit Agreement.
The additional borrowings resulted in $
0.9
 million of fees deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets during the twelve months ended December 28, 2024. After giving effect to additional borrowings, $
254.2
 million principal remains outstanding under Term Loan A.
The Second Restatement Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants, negative covenants, and events of default substantially comparable to the Original Credit Agreement.
The Second Restatement Agreement also contains covenants that, among other things, limit NVI’s ability to incur additional debt, create liens against assets, make acquisitions, pay dividends or distributions on its stock, merge or consolidate with another entity and transfer or sell assets. We were in compliance with all covenants related to our long-term debt as of December 28, 2024.
The borrowing capacity remaining as of December 28, 2024 was $
293.6
 million due to a reduction of $
6.4
 million for letters of credit outstanding.

Stock Incentive Plans
The Company has provided equity-based compensation awards to its associates under 
three
 plans. In connection with the initial public offering of our common stock (the “IPO”), on October 23, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted, and its stockholders approved, the National Vision Holdings, Inc. 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan”). The total number of shares of common stock originally issuable under the 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan was 
4,000,000
. On June 12, 2024, the Company’s stockholders approved the amendment and restatement of the 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan, increasing the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance by an additional 
5,600,000
 shares. The plan authorizes the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards (“RSAs”), RSUs, PSUs, other equity-based awards and other cash-based awards to our associates, non-employee directors, officers, consultants and advisers. The Vision Holding Corp. 2013 Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plans provided for the issuance of stock options to directors, certain associates and consultants of Vision Holding Corp., its subsidiaries and affiliates. In 2014, our Board of Directors and stockholders of the Company approved the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan for Key Employees of National Vision Holdings, Inc. (formerly known as Nautilus Parent, Inc.) and its subsidiaries (the “2014 Stock Incentive Plan”). There were 
10,988,827
 stock options authorized for issuance pursuant to the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan. All stock awards under these plans vest through continued service. All options under these plans have a contractual life of 
10
 years. 
The Company also provides associates the opportunity to purchase Company common shares through the Associate Stock Purchase Plan (the “ASPP”), which the Company’s Board of Directors adopted and its stockholders approved on June 6, 2018. The ASPP provides that up to 
850,000
 shares of common stock, at par value of $
0.01
 per share, may be offered and issued under the ASPP.

Restricted stock units (RSUs)
Most RSUs vest in

 equal annual installments on the first, second and third anniversary of the grant date. The RSUs outstanding as of December 28, 2024 have $
14.3
 million intrinsic value. Non-employee directors were granted RSUs in fiscal year 2024.
Performance stock units (PSUs)
PSUs are settled after the end of a 
three-year
 performance period (i.e., cliff vesting), which begins on the first day of the grant year and are based on the Company’s achievement of certain performance targets. The performance stock units outstanding as of December 28, 2024 have $
9.1
 million intrinsic value. While the PSU amounts shown in the tables above reflect achievement at target, the number of PSUs ultimately vested will be based on a comparison of certified performance results to predefined performance criteria that include threshold, target and maximum attainment levels.
Associate Stock Purchase Plan
Under the ASPP, eligible associates receive a 
10
% discount from the market trading value of common stock of the Company at the time of purchase. Participants may contribute to the ASPP, not to exceed $
25,000
 under the ASPP in any calendar year. During fiscal year 2024, the amount of shares issued to eligible participants through the ASPP was not material.

In August 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) which, among other things, provides for a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax based on a prescribed measure of income as well as a 1% excise tax on stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022. Due to the mechanics of the 15% alternative minimum tax, the Company is not currently subject to it.

 million that can be utilized to reduce future federal income taxes, all of which does not expire. We believe it is more likely than not that we will realize a tax benefit for these NOL’s in the future except for $
11.7
 million of NOL carry-forwards ($
2.5
 million tax effected) on certain consolidated VIEs where we recognized a full valuation allowance as of fiscal year end 2024. In addition, we have NOL carry-forwards in varying amounts and with varying expiration dates in various states in which we operate.
For the fiscal year end 2024, we carry various state tax credits totaling $
0.3
 million that are available to offset certain future taxes. These state credits carry a valuation allowance of $
0.2
 million for the portion that we do not expect to be able to utilize in future tax years.
We have a $
0.9
 million deferred income tax asset for capital losses associated with the losses realized on the sale of our equity method non-consolidated investee and other investments. We do not expect to generate significant capital gains in the near future. Therefore, we believe it is more likely than not that we will not realize a tax benefit for the majority of these deferred income tax assets, and accordingly we have established a full valuation allowance for the amount deemed unrealizable.
As a result of our utilization of NOL carry-forwards to reduce or eliminate subsequent years’ tax obligations, our federal and a substantial number of our state income tax returns for fiscal years 2001 through 2024 remain open for examination by the tax authorities.
The Company evaluates uncertain tax positions using a “more-likely-than-not” threshold and recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by tax authorities. The Company evaluates uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and considers various factors, including, but not limited to, changes in tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, the effective settlement of matters subject to audit, information obtained during in-process audit activities and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position.

Revenue from Contracts with Customers
The majority of our annual revenues are recognized either at the point of sale or upon delivery and customer acceptance, paid for at the time of sale in cash, credit card, or on account with managed care payors having terms generally between 
14
 and 
120 days
, with most paying within 
90 days
. For sales of in-store non-prescription eyewear and related accessories, and paid eye exams, we recognize revenue at the point of sale. Our point in time revenues include 1) retail sales of prescription and non-prescription eyewear, contact lenses and related accessories to retail customers (including those covered by managed care), and 2) eye exams. Revenues recognized over time primarily include product protection plans (i.e. warranties) and eye care club memberships.
Revenues Recognized at a Point in Time
Owned & Host
Within our Owned & Host segment, product revenues include sales of prescription and non-prescription eyewear, contact lenses and related accessories to retail customers.
For sales of in-store non-prescription eyewear and related accessories, we recognize revenue at the point of sale. For sales of prescription eyewear, we recognize revenue when the performance obligations identified under the terms of contracts with our customers are satisfied, which generally occurs, for products, when those products have been delivered and accepted by our customers. Within our Owned & Host segment services and plans revenues, eye exam services sold on a stand-alone basis are also recognized at the point of sale which occurs immediately after the exam is performed.
Other revenues 
Revenues from our non-reportable segments are attributable to our dedicated e-commerce website and FirstSight operations. Our dedicated e-commerce website was previously managed by AC Lens and was transitioned to NVI. Our e-commerce website sells contact lenses and optical accessory products to retail customers, and recognizes revenue when products have been delivered to the customer. FirstSight issues individual vision plans in connection with our America’s Best operations in California.
Revenues Recognized Over Time
Within our Owned & Host segment, services and plans revenues include revenues from product protection plans (i.e. warranties), eye care club memberships and HMO vision plan fees. We offer extended warranty plans in our Owned & Host segment that generally provide repair and replacement of eyeglasses for primarily a 
one-year
 term after 
95
Table of Contents
purchase. We recognize service revenue under these programs on a straight-line basis over the warranty or service period which is consistent with our efforts expended to satisfy the obligation. We offer 
three-year
 eyecare club memberships in our Owned & Host segment to our contact lens customers. For these programs we apply the portfolio approach of recognizing revenues of contracts with similar characteristics and use estimates and assumptions that reflect the size and composition of the portfolio of contracts. We selected the portfolio approach because our historical club membership data demonstrate that our club customers behave similarly, such that the difference between the portfolio approach and calculating revenue of each individual contract is not material. We recognize revenue across the contract portfolio based on the value delivered to the customers relative to the remaining services promised under the programs. We determine the value delivered based on the expected timing and amount of customer usage of benefits over the terms of the contracts. The unamortized portion of amounts we collect in advance for these services and plans are reported as Deferred revenue (current and noncurrent portions) in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

(a)
The discount rate used to determine the lease assets and lease liabilities was derived upon considering (i) incremental borrowing rates on our term loan and revolving credit facility; (ii) Term SOFR margins for issuers of similar credit rating; and (iii) effect of collateralization. As a majority of our leases are 
five
-year and 
10
-year leases, we determined a lease discount rate for such tenors and determined this discount rate is reasonable for leases that were entered into during the period.
(b)
The discount rate on finance leases is higher than operating leases because the present value of minimum lease payments was higher than the fair value of leased properties for certain leases entered into prior to adoption of ASC 842. The discount rate differential for those leases is not material to our results of operations.

Fair Value Measurement
General
The Company uses a fair value hierarchy that is intended to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures. The fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are either observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect a reporting entity’s own market assumptions.
The Company is required to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value or disclose the fair values of certain assets and liabilities recorded at cost. Accounting standards define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is estimated assuming the transaction occurs in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability and includes consideration of non-performance risk and credit risk of both parties. A three-tier fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include:
•
Level 1 - Valuation inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets.
•
Level 2 - Valuation inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the instruments.
•
Level 3 - Valuation inputs are unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are determined using model-based techniques that include discounted cash flow models and similar techniques.
The fair value estimates of financial instruments are not necessarily indicative of the amounts we might pay or receive in actual market transactions. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material impact on the estimated fair value amounts.
Recurring fair value measurements
Interest Rate Derivatives
We recognize as assets or liabilities at fair value the estimated amounts we would receive or pay upon a termination of interest rate derivatives prior to their scheduled expiration dates. The fair value is based on information that is model-driven and whose inputs were observable (Level 2 inputs) such as Term SOFR forward rates. See Note 14. “Interest Rate Derivatives” for further details.
Convertible Promissory Note
On December 17, 2024, the Company purchased $
1.3
 million principal amount of a convertible promissory note issued by a private company. The convertible promissory note is an investment that will convert to an equity stake in the private company upon a predetermined conversion event and is also convertible by us under certain circumstances. The Company elected the fair value option in accordance with accounting guidance for financial instruments to record the convertible promissory note. The fair value option allows an entity to account for the entire financial instrument at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in earnings through the consolidated statements of operations at each reporting date. The Company elected the fair value option to account for the convertible promissory note because the Company believes it reflects the fair value of the note receivable and embedded features. As of December 28, 2024, given the time from the execution of the note until the end of our fiscal year, we determined the fair value of the convertible promissory note approximated its carrying value of $
1.3
 million; this investment is included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to Note 1. “Business and Significant Accounting Policies” for information on equity investments in this entity.
Non-recurring fair value measurements
We recognized impairments of $
39.9
 million during fiscal year 2024, primarily related to our EGW goodwill asset, Fred Meyer contracts and relationships intangible asset and our long-lived tangible store assets and ROU assets. Comparatively, we recognized $
2.7
 million, and $
5.5
 million in fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively, primarily related to our long-lived tangible store assets and ROU assets. A decrease in the estimated cash flows would lead to a lower fair value measurement, as would an increase in the discount rate. These non-recurring fair value measurements are classified as Level 3 measurements in the fair value hierarchy.
98
Table of contents
Long-lived and Right of Use (“ROU”) Store Assets
Refer to Note 2. “Discontinued Operations” for more information on impairment charges related to the termination of the Walmart partnership. This section discusses fair value measurements unrelated to the termination of the Walmart partnership. We recognized impairments of $
10.1
 million, $
2.7
 million and $
5.5
 million in fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, primarily related to our store assets. The cash flows used in estimating fair value were discounted using market rates from 
8.5
% to 
11.5
%. The estimated remaining fair value of the assets impaired during fiscal years 2024, and 2023, was $
5.6
 million, and $
2.8
 million, respectively; the estimated remaining fair values include amounts estimated at various dates during the related fiscal years. Substantially all of the remaining fair value of the impaired store assets in fiscal years 2024 and 2023 represents the fair value of ROU assets. 
Finite-Lived Intangible Assets
Related to the impairment recognized for the Fred Meyer contracts and relationships intangible asset, we estimated fair value using the discounted cash flow method of the income approach. The cash flows included assumptions about future extensions of our relationship with Fred Meyer, as well as assumptions about future revenue growth and profitability, and were discounted using a rate of 
9
%. Refer to Note 1. “Business and Significant Accounting Policies” and Note 5. “Goodwill and Intangible Assets” for more details on the Fred Meyer contracts and relationships intangible asset.
Goodwill
We used the discounted cash flow method of the income approach in our analyses and considered projected cash flows with a discount rate of 
10.5
%. A decrease in the estimated cash flows would lead to a lower fair value measurement, as would an increase in the discount rate. This non-recurring fair value measurement is classified as Level 3 measurements in the fair value hierarchy. The impairment charge recognized during the year ended December 28, 2024 resulting from the annual impairment testing was $
19.2
 million related to the goodwill of Eyeglass World. The impairment charge is recognized in corporate and other and reflected in Asset impairment in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income. Refer to Note 1. “Business and Significant Accounting Policies” and Note 5. “Goodwill and Intangible Assets” for more details on the impairment charge.
Additional fair value information
Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash
The carrying amount of cash equivalents and restricted cash approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity of the instruments. All cash and cash equivalents are denominated in U.S. currency.
Accounts Receivable, Net
The carrying amount of accounts receivable approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of those items and the effect of credit losses.
Accounts Payable and Other Payables and Accrued Expenses
The carrying amounts of accounts payable and other payables and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of those items.
Term Loan A and Revolving Loans
Since the borrowings under the $
254.2
 million outstanding principal Term Loan A and $
300.0
 million aggregate principal Revolving Loans utilize variable interest rate setting mechanisms such as Term SOFR, the fair values of these borrowings are deemed to approximate the carrying values. We also considered the effect of our own credit risk on the fair values of our Term Loan A and Revolving Loans. Refer to Note 6. “Debt” for more information on these borrowings.
2025 Notes
The estimated fair value of the 2025 Notes was approximately $
83.3
 million and $
303.3
 million, as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively. The estimated fair value of the 2025 Notes is based on the prices the 2025 Notes have traded in the market as well as overall market conditions on the date of valuation, stated coupon rates, the number of coupon payments each year and the maturity dates, and represents a Level 2 measurement. Refer to Note 6. “Debt” for more information on the 2025 Notes.

Legal Proceedings
From time to time, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings incidental to its business. Because of the nature and inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot predict with certainty the ultimate resolution of these actions and, should the outcome of these actions be unfavorable, the Company’s business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.
The Company reviews the status of its legal proceedings and records a provision for a liability when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. This review is updated periodically as additional information becomes available. If either or both of the criteria are not met, we reassess whether there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss, or additional losses, may be incurred. If there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, we disclose the estimate of the amount of the loss or range of losses, or that an estimate of loss cannot be made. The Company expenses its legal fees as incurred.
We are currently and may in the future become subject to various claims and pending or threatened lawsuits in the ordinary course of our business.
On September 23, 2022, we were served with notice of a lawsuit filed by a former employee in California state court alleging, on behalf of a proposed class of employees, several violations of California wage and hour laws. On December 9, 2022, the case was removed to the federal District Court for the Northern District of California. On January 18, 2023, we were served with a related representative action filed in California state court pursuant to California’s Private Attorneys General Act. We filed an answer to this action on February 17, 2023. On September 29, 2023, the state court set the PAGA action for trial on October 7, 2024. The parties attended mediation on March 11, 2024, but a resolution of the matter was not reached at that time. Following mediation, the parties agreed to a settlement of all claims alleged by the named plaintiff on behalf of himself and all putative class members and other aggrieved employees. The Company will pay $
4.5
 million for the gross settlement fund in connection with the settlement. The settlement is subject to approval by the court following a fairness hearing. The parties agreed to move the federal and state court actions to state court for review of the settlement terms agreed to by the parties.
On June 6, 2023, the Company was served with notice of a former employee’s intention to file a representative action against the Company pursuant to California’s Private Attorneys General Act based on alleged violations of California’s wage and hour laws. On June 22, 2023, the Company was served with a related lawsuit filed by the former employee in California state court alleging, on behalf of a proposed class of employees, violations of California wage and hour laws. On July 24, 2023, the Company filed its answer and a notice of removal of the case to the federal District Court for the Southern District of California. On July 28, 2023, the Company filed a Notice of Related Cases, seeking for both the case currently pending in the Northern District of California and described in the paragraph above and this case to be assigned to the same Judge/Magistrate Judge in an effort to save judicial effort and avoid duplication of labor. On August 15, 2023, the parties filed a stipulation to stay the case in the Southern District of California pending the resolution of the lawsuit pending in the Northern District of California. On August 21, 2023, the court entered an Order to Show Cause why the action should not be either dismissed or transferred to the federal court for the Northern District of California. Following the parties’ submission of their respective responses, the court dismissed the action without prejudice on September 11, 2023. The plaintiff retains his ability to pursue a PAGA action in state court pursuant to the June 6, 2023 notice. On January 22, 2024, the plaintiff filed a demand for arbitration of the claims set forth in the Complaint previously filed in state court in June 2023. The 
101
Table of Contents
Company filed its response to the arbitration demand and the parties have engaged in limited discovery. We dispute the plaintiff’s allegations and intend to vigorously defend the litigation.
On January 27, 2023, a purported class action complaint was filed in federal court in the Northern District of Georgia against the Company and 
two
 of the Company’s officers (the “Securities Class Action”). The complaint alleges violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 for materially false and misleading statements made between May 2021 and May 2022. The complaint seeks unspecified damages as well as equitable relief. On March 28, 2023, the original plaintiff, City of Southfield General Employees Retirement System, and a new plaintiff, International Union of Operating Engineers, Local No. 793, Members Pension Benefit Trust of Ontario, filed a lead plaintiff motion, seeking to be appointed co-lead plaintiffs. On April 3, 2023, the Company along with its named officers filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. On May 19, 2023, the court granted the lead plaintiff motion. On June 30, 2023, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which added a claim under Section 20A of the Exchange Act and extended the alleged class period to February 28, 2023. On August 21, 2023, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The plaintiffs filed their response in opposition to this motion on October 5, 2023. On March 30, 2024, the court granted the Company’s motion and dismissed the amended complaint with prejudice. On April 29, 2024, the plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration of the order granting the motion to dismiss. The Company and named officers filed a response in opposition to the plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration on May 13, 2024, and the plaintiffs then filed a reply in support of their motion on May 28, 2024. The Company disputes the allegations asserted by plaintiffs and will continue to defend the litigation vigorously.
On May 23, 2024, a stockholder derivative complaint was filed by a stockholder in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of the Company (the “Derivative Action”). The Derivative Action is based on the same alleged facts and circumstances as the Securities Class Action and names certain of the Company’s officers, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer, and the Company’s directors who were members of the Company’s Board of Directors during the relevant time period as defendants. The Derivative Action alleges claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and violations of the Exchange Act and seeks to recover damages on behalf of the Company. On July 24, 2024, the Company along with the named defendants, filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. On September 9, 2024, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on October 31, 2024. The plaintiff filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss on December 16, 2024, and the defendants filed a reply brief on January 15, 2025. The defendants dispute the allegations made by the plaintiff and intend to vigorously defend the litigation.

Interest Rate Derivatives
We were party to an interest rate collar to offset the variability of cash flows in Term SOFR-indexed debt interest payments. During the second quarter of 2023, we amended the reference rate of the collar from LIBOR to Term SOFR. The interest rate collar matured on July 18, 2024.
We recognized (gains) losses on the change in fair value of the interest rate collar of $(
0.5
) million, $(
2.3
) million, and $(
18.0
) million in 
Interest expense
, net during fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
Cash flows related to derivatives qualifying as hedges are included in the same section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as the underlying assets and liabilities being hedged. Cash flows during fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022 related to derivatives not qualifying as hedges were included in the operating section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and were immaterial.

Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average shares outstanding for the period and includes the dilutive impact of potential new shares issuable upon vesting and exercise of stock options, vesting of restricted stock units, and assumed conversion of the 2025 Notes. Potential shares of common stock are excluded from the computation of diluted EPS if their effect is anti-dilutive. 
Diluted EPS related to the 2025 Notes is calculated using the if-converted method; the number of dilutive shares is based on the initial conversion rate associated with the 2025 Notes. 
A reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted EPS calculations is as follows:

Segment Reporting
The Company’s operating segments were determined on the same basis as used by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) to evaluate performance internally. Our CODM is our chief executive officer. Our operations consist primarily of 
one
 reportable segment:
•
Owned & Host store brands - Our owned brands consist of our America’s Best and Eyeglass World operating segments. In America’s Best stores, vision care services are provided by optometrists employed either by us or by independent professional corporations. Eyeglass World locations offer eye exams, primarily provided by independent optometrists, and have on-site laboratories. Our Host operating segments consist of Military and Fred Meyer. These brands provide eye exams principally by independent optometrists in nearly all locations. We have aggregated our America’s Best, Eyeglass World, Military and Fred Meyer operating segments into a single reportable segment due to similar economic characteristics and similarity of the nature of products and services, production processes, class of customers, regulatory environment and distribution methods of those brands.
103
Table of Contents
In addition to the single reportable segment identified above, we have 
two
 other operating segments: our dedicated e-commerce website and FirstSight. Our dedicated e-commerce website was previously managed by AC Lens and was transitioned to NVI in fiscal year 2024; the continuing operations for all periods presented reflect the results of this website. FirstSight sells single-service health plans in connection with the operations of America’s Best operations in California. The results of these 
two
 segments are presented separately from our reportable segment and do not meet the quantitative thresholds to be reportable segments.
The “corporate and other” category represents corporate overhead support expenses as well certain non-cash charges, including asset impairment, stock-based compensation expense, and the impact of certain events, gains, or losses excluded from the assessment of segment performance.
Other adjustments to reportable segment results represent adjustments necessary for the presentation of consolidated financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, specifically effects of the change in unearned and deferred revenue during the period.
Our former Legacy reportable segment and the majority of our former AC Lens operations as well as related effects of unearned and deferred revenue are classified as discontinued operations. Refer to Note 2. “Discontinued Operations” for information related to our discontinued operations.
The operating segments identified above are the business activities of the Company for which discrete financial information is available and for which operating results are regularly provided to, and reviewed by, our CODM to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company considers each of our brands to be an operating segment and has further concluded that presenting the results of our reportable segment provides meaningful information consistent with the objectives of ASC 280, 
Segment Reporting
.
The CODM uses segment EBITDA, calculated as net revenue, less costs applicable to revenue, less SG&A expenses, to evaluate the performance, and make decisions about the allocation of resources to segments predominantly in the annual budget and forecasting process. The CODM considers budget-to-actual variances on a monthly and quarterly basis when making decisions about the allocation of resources to each segment. Consistent with what the CODM reviews, depreciation and amortization and interest expense(income), net are excluded from segment EBITDA. 
There are no differences between the measurement of our reportable segment’s assets and consolidated assets. There have been no changes from prior periods in the measurement methods used to determine reportable segment profit or loss, and there have been no asymmetrical allocations to segments.
Reportable segment information is presented on the same basis as our consolidated financial statements, except for net revenue and associated costs applicable to revenue, which are presented on a cash basis, including point of sales for managed care payors and excluding the effects of unearned and deferred revenue, consistent with what the CODM regularly reviews. Asset information is not included in the following summary since the CODM does not regularly review such information for the reportable segment.
The following table is a summary of certain financial data for our Owned & Host reportable segment, and other categories, and includes a reconciliation to the Company’s consolidated earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes.

(“NVI”) and its subsidiaries. NVHI was incorporated in Delaware on February 14, 2014 under the name Nautilus Parent, Inc. There were no financial transactions between the inception date and March 13, 2014, the date the majority ownership of NVI was transferred from private equity funds managed by Berkshire Partners LLC (“Berkshire”) to affiliates of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P (“KKR”). In October 2017, we completed the initial public offering of our common stock. By August 2019, each of KKR and Berkshire had sold their remaining holdings of our common stock. In the parent-company-only financial statements, NVHI’s investment in subsidiaries is stated at cost, plus equity in undistributed earnings of subsidiaries since the date of acquisition, less dividends. The parent-company-only financial statements should be read in conjunction with the NVHI consolidated financial statements.

2.50
% and are convertible into cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our election, based on the applicable conversion rate at such time. NVHI contributed the proceeds from the 2025 Notes to NVI as additional investments during the fiscal year 2020. See Note 6. “Debt” to the NVHI consolidated financial statements for details of the 2025 Notes, including information on the repurchases of $
217.7
 million and $
100.0
 million of aggregate principal amount of our 2025 Notes in August 2024 and November 2023, respectively.
2. Guarantees and Restrictions

 million of principal amount of long-term debt outstanding under its Term Loan A and 
no
 outstanding cash borrowings under its $
300.0

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and our Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. 
In accordance with Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 28, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and the CFO have concluded that, as of December 28, 2024, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that material information relating to the Company required to be disclosed in the Company’s periodic filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) is made known to them in a timely manner.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) for the Company. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements of the Company in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
•
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
•
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company's management and directors; and
•
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2024 in accordance with the criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
Based on this assessment, management concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2024. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, as auditors of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 28, 2024, has issued their attestation report on management’s internal control over financial reporting which is set forth below.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of National Vision Holdings, Inc.     
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of National Vision Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 28, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 28, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 25, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
