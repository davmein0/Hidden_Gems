SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Annual Report on Form 10-K (this “Form 10-K”) contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), which are subject to the “safe harbor” created by those sections. All statements, other than statements of historical facts included in this Form 10-K, including statements concerning our plans, objectives, goals, beliefs, business strategies, future events, business conditions, results of operations, financial position, business outlook, business trends and other information, may be forward-looking statements.
Words such as “believes,” “expects,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “seeks,” “intends,” “plans,” “estimates,” or “anticipates,” and variations of such words or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are not historical facts, or guarantees of future performance and are based upon our current expectations, beliefs, estimates and projections, and various assumptions, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. Our expectations, beliefs, and projections are expressed in good faith and we believe there is a reasonable basis for them. However, there can be no assurance that management’s expectations, beliefs and projections will result or be achieved and actual results may vary materially from what is expressed in or indicated by the forward-looking statements.
There are a number of risks, uncertainties and other important factors, many of which are beyond our control, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those described below in the “Risk Factors Summary,” in Part I. Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Form 10-K and those described from time to time in our future reports to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
We caution you that the risks, uncertainties and other factors referenced above may not contain all of the risks, uncertainties and other factors that are important to you. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will realize the results, benefits or developments that we expect or anticipate or, even if substantially realized, that they will result in the consequences or affect us or our business in the way expected. There can be no assurance that (i) we have correctly measured or identified all of the factors affecting our business or the extent of these factors’ likely impact, (ii) the available information with respect to these factors on which such analysis is based is complete or accurate, (iii) such analysis is correct or (iv) our strategy, which is based in part on this analysis, will be successful. All forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K, apply only as of the date of this Form 10-K or as of the date they were made and, except as required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.

RISK FACTORS SUMMARY
The following is only a summary of the principal risks that may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. The following should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of the risk factors we face, which are set forth in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in this

Form 10-K.
Risks Related to Our Business and Operations
•
Market volatility, an overall decline in the health of the economy
, global macroeconomic conditions
 and other factors 
may affect
 consumer spending
 or behavior
,
 which could
 materially harm our sales, profitability and financial condition.
•
We may not be successful in implementing our transformation initiatives, or in anticipating the impact of important strategic initiatives, and our plans for implementing such initiatives may be altered or delayed due to various factors, which may have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.
•
Failure to recruit and retain vision care professionals for in-store roles or to provide remote care offerings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
•
The optical retail industry is highly competitive, and if we do not compete successfully, our business may be adversely impacted.
•
Our success depends upon our marketing, advertising and promotional efforts. If we are unable to implement them successfully or efficiently, or if our competitors are more effective than we are, we may experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
•
Our success depends substantially on the value of our owned brands, and failure to maintain, protect, and enhance their value could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
•
If we fail to open and operate new stores in a timely and cost-effective manner or fail to successfully enter new markets, our financial performance could be materially and adversely affected.
•
Our growth is dependent on our ability to increase sales in existing stores and to 
successfully reinvest in existing stores
.
•
If we are unable to successfully implement our pricing strategies, it could have 
an adverse impact
 on our business
.
•
We are a low-cost provider and our business model relies on the low cost of inputs. Factors such as wage rate increases, inflation, cost increases, increases in the price of raw materials and energy prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
•
We require significant capital to fund our expanding business
.
 If we are unable to maintain sufficient levels of cash flow from our operations, we may not be able to execute or sustain our growth strategy or we may require additional financing, which may not be available to us on satisfactory terms or at all.
•
Our growth strategy could strain our existing resources and cause the performance of our existing stores to suffer.
•
We are subject to risks associated with leasing substantial amounts of space, including future increases in occupancy costs.
•
Our e-commerce and omni-channel business faces distinct risks, and our failure to successfully manage those risks could have a negative impact on our profitability.
•
If we fail to retain our existing senior management team or attract qualified new personnel, such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
•
Our operating results and inventory levels fluctuate on a seasonal basis.
•
Catastrophic events, including changing climate and weather patterns leading to severe weather and natural disasters, may cause significant business interruptions and expenditures.
•
Certain technological advances, greater availability of, or increased consumer preferences for, vision correction alternatives to prescription eyeglasses or contact lenses, or future drug development for the correction of vision-related problems may reduce the demand for our products and adversely impact our business and profitability.
•
Our profitability and cash flows may be negatively affected if we are not successful in managing our inventory balances and inventory shrinkage.
•
We depend on our distribution centers and optical laboratories. The loss of, or disruption in the operations of, one or more of these facilities may adversely affect our ability to process and fulfill customer orders and deliver our products in a timely manner, or at all, and may result in quality issues, which would adversely affect our reputation, our business and our profitability.

•
If the performance of our Host
 brands declines or we are unable to maintain or extend our operating relationships with our Host partners, our business, profitability and cash flows may be adversely affected and we may be required to incur impairment charges.
•
The termination of our partnership with Walmart has had, and may continue to have, an impact on our business, revenues, profitability and cash flows, which impact could be material.
•
We may incur losses arising from our investments in technological innovators in the optical retail industry, including artificial intelligence, which would negatively affect our financial results.
•
Sustainability issues, including those related to climate change, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Risks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties
•
Our future operational success depends on our ability to develop, maintain and extend relationships with managed vision care companies, vision insurance providers and other third-party payors.
•
We face risks associated with vendors from whom our products are sourced and are dependent on a limited number of suppliers.

•
We rely heavily on our information technology systems, as well as those of our vendors, for our business to effectively operate and to safeguard confidential information; any significant failure, inadequacy, interruption or security breach could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operations.
•
We rely on third-party coverage and reimbursement, including government programs, for an increasing portion of our revenues, the future reduction of which could adversely affect our results of operations.
Risks Related to Our Legal and Regulatory Environment
•
We are subject to extensive state, local and federal vision care and healthcare laws and regulations and failure to adhere to such laws and regulations would adversely affect our business.
•
We are subject to managed vision care laws and regulations.
•
We are subject to rapidly changing and increasingly stringent laws, regulations, contractual obligations, and industry standards relating to privacy, data security and data protection. The restrictions and costs imposed by these laws and other obligations, or our actual or perceived failure to comply with them, could subject us to liabilities that adversely affect our business, operations and financial performance.
•
We could be adversely affected by product liability, product recall or personal injury issues.
•
Failure to comply with laws, regulations and enforcement activities or changes in statutory, regulatory, accounting and other legal requirements could potentially impact our operating and financial results.
•
Adverse judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings relating to our business operations could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
•
We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of our brand and adversely affect our business.
Risks Related to Our Indebtedness
•
We have a significant amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our business and financial position, including by limiting our business flexibility and preventing us from meeting our debt obligations.
•
A change in interest rates may adversely affect our business.
•
Our credit agreement contains restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.
•
Conversion of
 the 
2025 Notes could dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.
Risks Related to Ownership of Common Stock
•
Our stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance.
•
Because we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock, investors may not receive any return on investment unless they sell their common stock for a price greater than that which they paid for it.
•
We are a holding company with no operations of our own and, as such, we depend on our subsidiaries for cash to fund all of our operations and expenses, including future dividend payments, if any.
•
Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control.
•
Our Board of Directors is authorized to issue and designate shares of our preferred stock in additional series without stockholder approval.
•
Our certificate of incorporation provides, subject to limited exceptions, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation matters, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, associates or stockholders.
•
If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our stock or our sector, our stock price and trading volume could decline.
