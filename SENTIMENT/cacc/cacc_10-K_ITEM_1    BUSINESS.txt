ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
General
Credit Acceptance Corporation (referred to as the “Company”, “Credit Acceptance”, “we”, “our” or “us”) makes vehicle ownership possible by providing innovative financing solutions that enable automobile dealers to sell vehicles to consumers, regardless of their credit history.  Our financing programs are offered through a nationwide network of automobile dealers who benefit from sales of vehicles to consumers who otherwise could not obtain financing; from repeat and referral sales generated by these same customers; and from sales to customers responding to advertisements for our financing programs, but who actually end up qualifying for traditional financing.
Without our financing programs, consumers are often unable to purchase vehicles or they purchase unreliable ones.  Further, as we report to the three national credit reporting agencies, an important ancillary benefit of our programs is that we provide consumers with an opportunity to improve their lives by improving their credit score and move on to more traditional sources of financing.
Credit Acceptance was founded in 1972 to collect retail installment contracts (referred to as “Consumer Loans”) originated by automobile dealerships owned by Donald Foss, our founder. During the 1980s, we began to market this service to non-affiliated dealers and, at the same time, began to offer dealers a non-recourse cash payment (referred to as an “advance”) against anticipated future collections on Consumer Loans serviced for that dealer.
We refer to automobile dealers who participate in our programs and who share our desire to provide an opportunity to consumers to improve their lives as “Dealers.” Upon enrollment in our financing programs, the Dealer enters into a Dealer servicing agreement with us that defines the legal relationship between Credit Acceptance and the Dealer. The Dealer servicing agreement assigns the responsibilities for administering, servicing, and collecting the amounts due on Consumer Loans from the Dealers to us. We are an indirect lender from a legal perspective, meaning the Consumer Loan is originated by the Dealer and assigned to us. 
The majority of the Consumer Loans assigned to us are made to consumers with impaired or limited credit histories. The following table shows the percentage of Consumer Loans assigned to us with either FICO

Business Segment Information
We currently operate in one reportable segment which represents our core business of offering innovative financing solutions and related products and services that enable Dealers to sell vehicles to consumers regardless of their credit history. For information regarding our one reportable segment and related disclosures, see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Principal Business
We offer Dealers financing programs that enable them to sell vehicles to consumers, regardless of their credit history. We have two programs: the Portfolio Program and the Purchase Program.  Under the Portfolio Program, we advance money to Dealers (referred to as a “Dealer Loan”) in exchange for the right to service the underlying Consumer Loans. Under the Purchase Program, we buy the Consumer Loans from the Dealers (referred to as a “Purchased Loan”) and keep all amounts collected from the consumer.  Dealer Loans and Purchased Loans are collectively referred to as “Loans.”  The following table shows the percentage of Consumer Loans assigned to us under each of the programs for each of the last three years:

Represents advances paid to Dealers on Consumer Loans assigned under the Portfolio Program and one-time payments made to Dealers to purchase Consumer Loans assigned under the Purchase Program.  Payments of Dealer Holdback (as defined below) and accelerated Dealer Holdback are not included.
Portfolio Program
As payment for the vehicle, the Dealer generally receives the following:
•
a down payment from the consumer;
•
a cash advance from us; and
•
after the advance balance (cash advance and related Dealer Loan fees and costs) has been recovered by us, the cash from payments made on the Consumer Loan, net of certain collection costs and our servicing fee (“Dealer Holdback”).
We record the amount advanced to the Dealer as a Dealer Loan, which is classified within Loans receivable in our consolidated balance sheets. Cash advanced to the Dealer is automatically assigned to the Dealer’s open pool of advances. Dealers make an election as to how many Consumer Loans (either 50 or 100) will be assigned to an open pool before it is closed, and subsequent advances are assigned to a new pool. Unless we receive a request from the Dealer to keep a pool open, we automatically close each pool based on the Dealer’s election. All advances within a Dealer’s pool are secured by the future collections on the related Consumer Loans assigned to the pool. For Dealers with more than one pool, the pools are cross-collateralized so the performance of other pools is considered in determining eligibility for Dealer Holdback. We perfect our security interest with respect to the Dealer Loans by obtaining control or taking possession of the Consumer Loans, which list us as lien holder on the vehicle title.
The Dealer servicing agreement provides that collections received by us during a calendar month on Consumer Loans assigned by a Dealer are applied on a pool-by-pool basis as follows:
•
first, to reimburse us for certain collection costs;
•
second, to pay us our servicing fee, which generally equals 20% of collections;
•
third, to reduce the aggregate advance balance and to pay any other amounts due from the Dealer to us; and
•
fourth, to the Dealer as payment of Dealer Holdback.
If the collections on Consumer Loans from a Dealer’s pool are not sufficient to repay the advance balance and any other amounts due to us, the Dealer will not receive Dealer Holdback. Certain events may also result in Dealers forfeiting their rights to Dealer Holdback, including becoming inactive before assigning 100 Consumer Loans.
Dealers have an opportunity to receive an accelerated Dealer Holdback payment each time a pool of Consumer Loans is closed. The amount paid to the Dealer is calculated using a formula that considers the number of Consumer Loans assigned to the pool and the related forecasted collections and advance balance.
Since typically the combination of the advance and the consumer’s down payment provides the Dealer with a cash profit at the time of sale, the Dealer’s risk in the Consumer Loan is limited. We cannot demand repayment of the advance from the Dealer except in the event the Dealer is in default of the Dealer servicing agreement. Advances are made only after the consumer and Dealer have signed a Consumer Loan contract, we have received the executed Consumer Loan contract and supporting documentation in either physical or electronic form, and we have approved all of the related stipulations for funding. 
4
For accounting purposes, the transactions described under the Portfolio Program are not considered to be loans to consumers.  Instead, our accounting reflects that of a lender to the Dealer.  The classification as a Dealer Loan for accounting purposes is primarily a result of (1) the Dealer’s financial interest in the Consumer Loan and (2) certain elements of our legal relationship with the Dealer.
Purchase Program
The Purchase Program differs from the Portfolio Program in that the Dealer receives a one-time payment from us at the time of assignment to purchase the Consumer Loan instead of a cash advance at the time of assignment and future Dealer Holdback payments. For accounting purposes, the transactions described under the Purchase Program are considered to be originated by the Dealer and then purchased by us.
Program Enrollment
Dealers are granted access to the Portfolio Program upon enrollment. Access to the Purchase Program is typically only granted to Dealers that meet one of the following:
•
assigned at least 50 Consumer Loans under the Portfolio Program;
•
franchise dealership; or
•
independent dealership that meets certain criteria upon enrollment.
Revenue Sources
Credit Acceptance derives its revenues from the following principal sources:
•
finance charges, which are comprised of: (1) interest income earned on Loans; (2) administrative fees earned from ancillary products; (3) program fees charged to Dealers under the Portfolio Program; (4) Consumer Loan assignment fees charged to Dealers; and (5) direct origination costs incurred on Dealer Loans;
•
premiums earned on the reinsurance of vehicle service contracts; and
•
other income, which primarily consists of ancillary product profit sharing, remarketing fees, and interest. For additional information, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 to this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.

.  Our target market is approximately 60,000 independent and franchised automobile dealers in the United States. We have market area managers located throughout the United States that market our programs to prospective Dealers, enroll new Dealers, and support active Dealers.  The number of Dealer enrollments and active Dealers for each of the last three years are presented in the table below:

Active Dealers are Dealers who have received funding for at least one Loan during the period.
Once Dealers have enrolled in our programs, the market area managers work closely with the newly enrolled Dealers to help them successfully launch our programs within their dealerships.  Market area managers also provide active Dealers with ongoing support and consulting focused on improving the Dealers’ success on our programs, including assistance with increasing the volume and performance of Consumer Loan assignments.
Dealer Servicing Agreement.
 As a part of the enrollment process, a new Dealer is required to enter into a Dealer servicing agreement with Credit Acceptance that defines the legal relationship between Credit Acceptance and the Dealer. The Dealer servicing agreement assigns the responsibilities for administering, servicing, and collecting the amounts due on Consumer Loans from the Dealers to us. Under the typical Dealer servicing agreement, a Dealer represents that it will only assign Consumer Loans to us that satisfy criteria established by us, meet certain conditions with respect to their binding nature and the status of the security interest in the purchased vehicle, and comply with applicable state and federal laws and regulations.
The typical Dealer servicing agreement may be terminated by us or by the Dealer upon written notice. We may terminate the Dealer servicing agreement immediately in the case of an event of default by the Dealer.  Events of default include, among other things:
•
the Dealer’s refusal to allow us to audit its records relating to the Consumer Loans assigned to us;
•
the Dealer, without our consent, is dissolved; merges or consolidates with an entity not affiliated with the Dealer; or sells a material part of its assets outside the course of its business to an entity not affiliated with the Dealer; or
•
the appointment of a receiver for, or the bankruptcy or insolvency of, the Dealer.
While a Dealer can cease assigning Consumer Loans to us at any time without terminating the Dealer servicing agreement, if the Dealer elects to terminate the Dealer servicing agreement or in the event of a default, we have the right to require that the Dealer immediately pay us:
•
any unreimbursed collection costs on Dealer Loans;
•
any unpaid advances and all amounts owed by the Dealer to us; and
•
a termination fee equal to 15% of the then outstanding amount of the Consumer Loans assigned to us.
Upon receipt of such amounts in full, we reassign the Consumer Loans and our security interest in the financed vehicles to the Dealer.
In the event of a termination of the Dealer servicing agreement by us, we may continue to service Consumer Loans assigned by the Dealer to us prior to termination in the normal course of business without charging a termination fee.
Consumer Loan Assignment.
  Once a Dealer has enrolled in our programs, the Dealer may begin assigning Consumer Loans to us.  For legal purposes, a Consumer Loan is considered to have been assigned to us after the following has occurred:
•
the consumer and Dealer have signed a Consumer Loan contract; and
•
we have received the executed Consumer Loan contract and supporting documentation in either physical or electronic form.
6
For accounting and financial reporting purposes, a Consumer Loan is considered to have been assigned to us after the following has occurred:
•
the Consumer Loan has been legally assigned to us; and
•
we have made a funding decision and generally have provided funding to the Dealer in the form of either an advance under the Portfolio Program or one-time purchase payment under the Purchase Program.
A Consumer Loan is originated by the Dealer when a consumer enters into a contract with the Dealer that sets forth the terms of the agreement between the consumer and the Dealer for the payment of the purchase price of the vehicle.  The amount of the Consumer Loan consists of the total principal and interest that the consumer is required to pay over the term of the Consumer Loan.  Consumer Loans are written on a contract form provided or approved by us. Although the Dealer is named in the Consumer Loan contract, the Dealer generally does not have legal ownership of the Consumer Loan for more than a moment, and we, not the Dealer, are listed as lien holder on the vehicle title.  Consumers are obligated to make payments on the Consumer Loan directly to us, and any failure to make such payments will result in our pursuing payment through collection efforts.
All Consumer Loans submitted to us for assignment are processed through our Credit Approval Processing System (“CAPS”). CAPS allows Dealers to input a consumer’s credit application and view the response from us via the internet.  CAPS allows Dealers to: (1) receive a quick approval from us; (2) interact with our proprietary credit scoring system to optimize the structure of each transaction prior to delivery; and (3) create, electronically execute, and print legally compliant Consumer Loan documents.  All responses include the amount of funding (advance for a Dealer Loan or purchase price for a Purchased Loan), as well as any stipulations required for funding.  The amount of funding is determined using a formula which considers a number of factors, including the timing and amount of cash flows expected on the related Consumer Loan and our target profitability at the time the Consumer Loan is submitted to us for assignment. The estimated future cash flows are determined based upon our proprietary credit scoring system, which considers numerous variables, including attributes contained in the consumer’s credit bureau report, data contained in the consumer’s credit application, the structure of the proposed transaction, vehicle information, and other factors, to calculate a composite credit score that corresponds to an expected collection rate.  Our proprietary credit scoring system forecasts the collection rate based upon the historical performance of Consumer Loans in our portfolio that share similar characteristics.  The performance of our proprietary credit scoring system is evaluated monthly by comparing projected to actual Consumer Loan performance.  Adjustments are made to our proprietary credit scoring system as necessary.  For additional information on adjustments to forecasted collection rates, please see the Critical Accounting Estimates section in Item 7 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.
While a Dealer can submit any legally compliant Consumer Loan to us for assignment, the decision whether to provide funding to the Dealer and the amount of any funding is made solely by us.  Through our Dealer Service Center, we perform all significant functions relating to the processing of the Consumer Loan applications and bear certain costs of Consumer Loan assignment, including the cost of assessing the adequacy of Consumer Loan documentation, the cost of compliance with our underwriting guidelines, and the cost of verifying employment, residence, and other information provided by the Dealer.
We audit Consumer Loan files for compliance with our underwriting guidelines on a daily basis in order to assess whether Dealers are operating in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Dealer servicing agreement.  We occasionally identify breaches of the Dealer servicing agreement, and, depending upon the circumstances, and at our discretion, we may:
•
change pricing or charge the Dealer fees for future Consumer Loan assignments; 
•
reassign the Consumer Loans back to the Dealer and require repayment of the related advances and/or purchase payments; or 
•
terminate our relationship with the Dealer.
Consumer Loans that have been assigned to us can be reassigned back to the Dealer at the Dealer’s discretion as follows:
•
an individual Consumer Loan may be reassigned within 180 days of assignment, in which case we require repayment of the related advance or purchase payment and, if requested more than 90 days after assignment, payment of a fee; and
•
all Consumer Loans assigned under the Portfolio Program may be reassigned through termination of the Dealer servicing agreement, as described under “Dealer Servicing Agreement,” above.
7
Our business model allows us to share the risk and reward of collecting on the Consumer Loans with the Dealers, more so with the Portfolio Program than the Purchase Program. Such sharing is intended to motivate the Dealer to assign better quality Consumer Loans, follow our underwriting guidelines, comply with various legal regulations, meet our credit compliance requirements, and provide appropriate service and support to the consumer after the sale. In addition, our Dealer Service Center works closely with Dealers to assist them in resolving any documentation deficiencies or funding stipulations. We believe this arrangement causes the interests of the Dealer, the consumer, and us to all be aligned.
We measure various criteria for each Dealer against other Dealers in their geographic area as well as the top performing Dealers. Dealers are assigned a Dealer rating based upon the performance of their Consumer Loans in both the Portfolio Program and Purchase Program as well as other criteria. The Dealer rating is one of the factors used to determine the amount paid to Dealers as an advance or to acquire a Purchased Loan.  We provide each Dealer under the Portfolio Program with a monthly statement summarizing all activity that occurred on its Consumer Loan assignments.
Servicing.  
Our largest group of representatives services Consumer Loans that are in the early stages of delinquency. Our representatives work with consumers to attempt to develop a solution that will help them avoid becoming further past due and get them current where possible. We utilize a variety of methods to attempt to contact the consumer or to remind them of upcoming scheduled payments, including phone calls, email, text messaging, mail, and mobile notifications. 
The decision to repossess a vehicle is based on policy-based criteria. When a Consumer Loan is approved for repossession, we continue to service the Consumer Loan while it is being assigned to a third-party repossession service provider, who works on a contingency fee basis. Once a vehicle has been repossessed, the consumer can redeem the vehicle, whereupon the vehicle is returned to the consumer in exchange for paying off the Consumer Loan balance; or, where appropriate or if required by law, the vehicle is returned to the consumer and the consumer is permitted to continue with the Consumer Loan in exchange for a payment or series of payments which eliminates the past due balance. If the consumer elects not to regain possession of the vehicle after repossession, the vehicle is sold at a wholesale automobile auction. Prior to sale, the vehicle is typically inspected by a representative at the auction who provides repair and reconditioning recommendations. Alternatively, our remarketing representatives may inspect the vehicle directly. Our remarketing representatives then authorize any repair and reconditioning work in order to maximize the net sale proceeds at auction.
If the vehicle sale proceeds are not sufficient to satisfy the balance owing on the Consumer Loan, we may offer the consumer the opportunity to settle any outstanding balance for less than the amount owed. At this point, the Consumer Loan is serviced by either: (1) our internal collection team, in the event the consumer is willing to make payments on the full or partial deficiency balance; or (2) where permitted by law, our external collection team, if it is believed that legal action will be successful in reducing or eliminating the deficiency balance owing on the Consumer Loan. Our external collection team may assign Consumer Loans to third-party collection attorneys who work on a contingency fee basis.
Representatives service Consumer Loans through our servicing platform, which consists of the following two systems:
•
The collection system, which assigns Consumer Loans to representatives through a predictive dialer and records all collection activity, including:
•
details of past phone conversations with the consumer;
•
collection letters sent;
•
promises to pay;
•
broken promises;
•
payment history;
•
repossession orders; and
•
collection attorney activity.  
•
The servicing system, which maintains a record of all transactions relating to Consumer Loan assignments and is a primary source of data utilized to:
•
determine the outstanding balance of the Consumer Loans;
•
forecast future collections;
•
analyze the profitability of our program; and
•
evaluate our proprietary credit scoring system.

Ancillary Products
We provide Dealers the ability to offer vehicle service contracts to consumers through our relationships with Third-Party Providers (“TPPs”). A vehicle service contract provides the consumer protection by paying for the repair or replacement of certain components of the vehicle in the event of a mechanical failure. The retail price of the vehicle service contract is included in the principal balance of the Consumer Loan. The wholesale cost of the vehicle service contract is paid to the TPP, net of an administrative fee retained by us. We recognize our fee as finance charges on a level-yield basis over the life of the related Loan. The difference between the wholesale cost and the retail price to the consumer is paid to the Dealer as a commission. Under the Portfolio Program, the wholesale cost of the vehicle service contract and the commission paid to the Dealer are charged to the Dealer’s advance balance. TPPs process claims on vehicle service contracts that are underwritten by third-party insurers. We bear the risk of loss for claims on certain vehicle service contracts that are reinsured by us. We market the vehicle service contracts directly to Dealers.  Our agreement with one of our TPPs allows us to receive profit sharing payments depending on the performance of the vehicle service contracts. 
Our wholly owned subsidiary VSC Re Company (“VSC Re”) is engaged in the business of reinsuring coverage under vehicle service contracts sold to consumers by Dealers on vehicles financed by us. VSC Re currently reinsures vehicle service contracts that are offered through one of our TPPs.  Vehicle service contract premiums, which represent the selling price of the vehicle service contract to the consumer, less fees and certain administrative costs, are contributed to trust accounts controlled by VSC Re.  These premiums are used to fund claims covered under the vehicle service contracts.  VSC Re is a bankruptcy remote entity.  As such, our exposure to fund claims is limited to the trust assets controlled by VSC Re and our net investment in VSC Re.
We provide Dealers the ability to offer Guaranteed Asset Protection (“GAP”) to consumers through our relationships with TPPs. GAP provides the consumer protection by paying the difference between the loan balance and the amount covered by the consumer’s insurance policy in the event of a total loss of the vehicle due to severe damage or theft. The retail price of GAP is included in the principal balance of the Consumer Loan. The wholesale cost of GAP is paid to the TPP, net of an administrative fee retained by us. We recognize our fee as finance charges on a level-yield basis over the life of the related Loan. The difference between the wholesale cost and the retail price to the consumer is paid to the Dealer as a commission. Under the Portfolio Program, the wholesale cost of GAP and the commission paid to the Dealer are charged to the Dealer’s advance balance. TPPs process claims on GAP contracts that are underwritten by third-party insurers. Our agreement with one of our TPPs allow us to receive profit sharing payments depending on the performance of the GAP contracts.
Under the Purchase Program, we provide Dealers that meet certain criteria the ability to offer vehicle service contracts and GAP to consumers through the Dealers’ relationships with TPPs. The retail price of the vehicle service contract and/or GAP is included in the principal balance of the Consumer Loan and is paid to the Dealer. Under this arrangement, we do not receive an administrative fee, and the Dealers’ TPPs process claims.
Competition
The market for consumers who do not qualify for conventional automobile financing is large and highly competitive. The market is currently served by “buy here, pay here” dealerships, banks, captive finance affiliates of automobile manufacturers, credit unions, and independent finance companies both publicly and privately owned.  Many of these companies are much larger and have greater resources than us. We compete on the basis of the level of service provided by our Dealer Service Center and sales personnel. In addition, we compete by offering a profitable and efficient method for Dealers to finance consumers who would be more difficult or less profitable to finance through other methods.

Seasonality
Our business is seasonal with peak Consumer Loan assignments and collections occurring during the first quarter of the year. This seasonality has a material impact on our interim results, as we are required to recognize a significant provision for credit losses expense at the time of assignment. For additional information, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Regulation
Our business is subject to laws and regulations, including the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, prohibitions against unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts and practices, and various other state and federal laws and regulations.  These laws and regulations, among other things, require licensing and qualification; limit interest rates, fees, and other charges associated with the Consumer Loans assigned to us; require specified disclosures by Dealers to consumers; govern the sale and terms of ancillary products; and define the rights to repossess and sell collateral. Failure to comply with these laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on us by, among other things, limiting the jurisdictions in which we may operate, restricting our ability to realize the value of the collateral securing the Consumer Loans, making it more costly or burdensome to do business, or resulting in potential liability.  The volume of new or modified laws and regulations, and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, has increased in recent years. From time to time, enactment and interpretations of legislation and regulations increase the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities, or affect the competitive balance among financial services providers. Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of financial institutions and financial services providers are frequently made in the U.S. Congress, in state legislatures, and by various regulatory agencies.  Such changes in laws and regulations, or the interpretation of such laws and regulations, may change our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways and may have a material adverse effect on our business.
We are subject to supervision by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “Bureau”). The Bureau has rulemaking and enforcement authority over certain non-depository institutions, including us.  The Bureau is specifically authorized, among other things, to take actions to prevent companies providing consumer financial products or services and their service providers from engaging in unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices in connection with consumer financial products and services, and to issue rules requiring enhanced disclosures or consumer access to information for consumer financial products or services.  Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), the Bureau also may restrict the use of pre-dispute mandatory arbitration clauses in contracts between covered persons and consumers for a consumer financial product or service.  The Bureau also has authority to interpret, enforce, and issue regulations implementing enumerated consumer laws, including certain laws that apply to our business. The Dodd-Frank Act and regulations promulgated thereunder may affect our cost of doing business, may limit or expand our permissible activities, may affect the competitive balance within our industry and market areas, and could have a material adverse effect on us.
In addition to the Bureau, other state and federal agencies have the ability to regulate aspects of our business. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act provides a mechanism for state attorneys general to investigate us. Separately, state attorneys general and certain state regulators have authority under their respective rules and laws, to investigate and/or regulate aspects of our business. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction to investigate aspects of our business. We expect that regulatory investigations of our business by both state and federal agencies will continue and that the results of these investigations could have a material adverse impact on us. 
Ongoing Regulatory Matters
Regulatory matters to which we are a party include the following matters, in each case the eventual scope, duration, and outcome of which we cannot predict at this time. 
•
On December 1, 2021, we received a subpoena from the Office of the Attorney General for the State of California seeking documents and information regarding GAP products, GAP product administration, and refunds. 
11
•

After April 22, 2019 through March 7, 2022, we received additional subpoenas from the Bureau. On December 6, 2021, we received a Notice and Opportunity to Respond and Advise letter from the Staff of the Office of Enforcement (“Staff”) of the Bureau, stating that the Staff was considering whether to recommend that the Bureau take legal action against the Company for alleged violations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (the “CFPA”) in connection with the Company’s consumer loan origination practices. See the description below of the lawsuit commenced by the Bureau on January 4, 2023. 
On January 4, 2023, the Office of the New York State Attorney General and the Bureau jointly filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that the Company engaged in deceptive practices, fraud, illegality, and securities fraud in violation of New York Executive Law § 63(12) and New York General Business Law §§ 349 and 352, and that the Company engaged in deceptive and abusive acts and provided substantial assistance to a covered person or service provider in violation of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. § 5531 and 12 U.S.C. § 5536(a)(1)(B). The complaint seeks injunctive relief, an accounting of all consumers for whom the Company provided financing, restitution, damages, disgorgement, civil penalties, and payment of costs. On March 14, 2023, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. On August 7, 2023, the court stayed the action pending the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in 
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau v. Community Financial Services Association of America Ltd
., No. 22-448 (“CFSA”). On July 1, 2024, the court lifted the stay in view of the decision in CFSA and requested revised briefing on the Company’s motion to dismiss that would address the intervening legal developments and sharpen the issues for resolution. As of October 29, 2024, the Company's motion to dismiss has been fully briefed. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself in this matter.

On March 18, 2016, we received a subpoena from the Attorney General of the State of Maryland, relating to the Company’s repossession and sale policies and procedures in the state of Maryland. On April 3, 2020, we received a subpoena from the Attorney General of the State of Maryland relating to the Company’s origination and collection policies and procedures in the state of Maryland. On August 11, 2020, we received a subpoena from the Attorney General of the State of Maryland restating most of the requests contained in the March 18, 2016 and April 3, 2020 subpoenas, making additional requests, and expanding the inquiry to include 41 other states (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin) and the District of Columbia. Also on August 11, 2020, we received from the Attorney General of the State of New Jersey a subpoena that is essentially identical to the August 11, 2020 Maryland subpoena, both as to substance and as to the jurisdictions identified. The Company has been informed that the State of Kansas, the State of Texas, and the State of Iowa have withdrawn from the multistate investigation. 
In addition, governmental regulations that would deplete the supply of used vehicles, such as environmental protection regulations governing emissions or fuel consumption, could have a material adverse effect on us.
Dealers must also comply with credit and trade practice statutes and regulations. Failure of Dealers to comply with these statutes and regulations could result in consumers having rights of rescission and other remedies that could have a material adverse effect on us.

The sale of vehicle service contracts and GAP by Dealers in connection with Consumer Loans assigned to us from Dealers is also subject to state laws and regulations. As we are the holder of the Consumer Loans that may, in part, finance these products, some of these state laws and regulations may apply to our servicing and collection of the Consumer Loans. Although these laws and regulations do not significantly affect our business, there can be no assurance that insurance or other regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which these products are offered by Dealers will not seek to regulate or restrict the operation of our business in these jurisdictions. Any regulation or restriction of our business in these jurisdictions could materially adversely affect the income received from these products.
We believe that we maintain all material licenses and permits required for our current operations and are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Our agreements with Dealers provide that the Dealer shall indemnify us with respect to any loss or expense we incur as a result of the Dealer’s failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
