ITEM 2.    PROPERTIES
Our headquarters is located in Southfield, Michigan, in an office building we purchased in 1993, which includes approximately 136,000 square feet of space. To take advantage of the national talent pool and to maximize team member satisfaction, we utilize a “remote first” strategy. While remote work has become the primary experience for most of our team members, some team members, due to the nature of their responsibilities, continue to work primarily on site at our headquarters. Additionally, we have various on-site meetings, events, and team building activities for which in-person attendance is encouraged. Therefore, we continue to have a need for office space.
