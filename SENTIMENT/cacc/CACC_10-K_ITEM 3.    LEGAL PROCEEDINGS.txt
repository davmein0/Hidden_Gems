ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
In the normal course of business and as a result of the consumer-oriented nature of the industry in which we operate, we and other industry participants are frequently subject to various consumer claims, litigation, and regulatory investigations seeking damages, fines, and statutory penalties. The claims allege, among other theories of liability, violations of state, federal, and foreign truth-in-lending, credit availability, credit reporting, consumer protection, warranty, debt collection, insurance, and other consumer-oriented laws and regulations, including claims seeking damages for alleged physical and mental harm relating to the repossession and sale of consumers’ vehicles and other debt collection activities. As the assignee of Consumer Loans originated by Dealers, we may also be named as a co-defendant in lawsuits filed by consumers principally against Dealers. We may also have disputes and litigation with Dealers. The claims may allege, among other theories of liability, that we breached the Dealer servicing agreement. We may also have disputes and litigation with vendors and other third parties. The claims may allege, among other theories of liability, that we breached a license agreement or contract. The damages, fines, and penalties that may be claimed by consumers, regulatory agencies, Dealers, vendors, or other third parties in these types of matters can be substantial. The relief requested by plaintiffs varies but may include requests for compensatory, statutory, and punitive damages and injunctive relief, and plaintiffs may seek treatment as purported class actions or they may file individual arbitration demands for which arbitration providers may request separate filing fees. An adverse ultimate disposition in any action to which we are a party or otherwise subject, or the requirement to pay filing fees for a large number of individual arbitration demands, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, liquidity, and results of operations. 
For a description of significant litigation to which we are a party, see 
Note 15
 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.

ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Overview
We make vehicle ownership possible by providing innovative financing solutions that enable automobile dealers to sell vehicles to consumers, regardless of their credit history. Our financing programs are offered through a nationwide network of automobile dealers who benefit from sales of vehicles to consumers who otherwise could not obtain financing; from repeat and referral sales generated by these same customers; and from sales to customers responding to advertisements for our financing programs, but who actually end up qualifying for traditional financing.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, consolidated net income was $247.9 million, or $19.88 per diluted share, compared to $286.1 million, or $21.99 per diluted share, for the same period in 2023. The decrease in consolidated net income was primarily due to increases in interest expense and provision for credit losses, partially offset by an increase in finance charges. Our results for the year ended December 31, 2024 included:
•
A larger decline in forecasted collection rates 
The decline in forecasted collection rates decreased forecasted net cash flows from our Loan portfolio by $314.0 million, or 3.1%, compared to a decrease in forecasted collection rates during 2023 that decreased forecasted net cash flows from our Loan portfolio by $206.3 million, or 2.3%. The $314.0 million decrease in forecasted net cash flows during 2024 was composed of an ordinary decrease in forecasted net cash flows of $166.8 million, or 1.7%, and an adjustment applied to our forecasting methodology during the second quarter of 2024, which upon implementation, reduced forecasted net cash flows by $147.2 million, or 1.4%. The $206.3 million decrease in forecasted net cash flows during 2023 was composed of an ordinary decrease in forecasted net cash flows of $161.8 million, or 1.8%, and an adjustment to our forecasting methodology, which upon implementation, reduced forecasted net cash flows by $44.5 million, or 0.5%. 
•
A decrease in forecasted profitability for Consumer Loans assigned in 2021 through 2024 
Forecasted profitability was lower than our estimates at December 31, 2023, due to both a decline in forecasted collection rates and slower forecasted net cash flow timing since 2023. The slower forecasted net cash flow timing was primarily a result of a decrease in Consumer Loan prepayments, which remain below historical averages.
•
Growth in Consumer Loan assignment volume and the average balance of our Loan portfolio 
Unit and dollar volumes grew 16.1% and 11.3%, respectively, as compared to 2023. The average balance of our Loan portfolio, which is our largest-ever, increased 13.6% as compared to 2023.

•
An increase in the initial spread on Consumer Loan assignments

The initial spread increased to 22.1%

compared to 21.3% on Consumer Loans assigned in 2023.

•
An increase in our average cost of debt

Our average cost of debt increased from 5.5% to 7.2%, primarily as a result of higher interest rates on recently completed or extended secured financings and recently issued senior notes and the repayment of older secured financings and senior notes with lower interest rates. 
•
A decrease in common shares outstanding due to stock repurchases
We repurchased approximately 590,000 shares, or 4.7% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of the year.
•
Loss on sale of building
We recognized a $23.7 million loss during the second quarter of 2024 related to the sale of one of our two office buildings. The building was sold to reduce excess office space and eliminate the associated annual operating costs of approximately $2.1 million. 
28
For the year ended December 31, 2023, consolidated net income was $286.1 million, or $21.99 per diluted share, compared to $535.8 million, or $39.32 per diluted share, for the same period in 2022. The decrease in consolidated net income was primarily due to increases in provision for credit losses and interest expense. Our results for the year ended December 31, 2023 included:
•
A larger decline in forecasted collection rates 
The decline in forecasted collection rates decreased forecasted net cash flows from our Loan portfolio by $206.3 million, or 2.3%, compared to a decrease in forecasted collection rates during 2022 that decreased forecasted net cash flows from our Loan portfolio by $59.7 million, or 0.7%.
•
A decrease in forecasted profitability for Consumer Loans assigned in 2020 through 2022  
Forecasted profitability was lower than our estimates at December 31, 2022, due to a decline in forecasted collection rates during 2023 and slower forecasted net cash flow timing during 2023, primarily as a result of a decrease in Consumer Loan prepayments to below-average levels.

•
Growth in Consumer Loan assignment volume and the average balance of our Loan portfolio 
Unit and dollar volumes grew 18.6% and 14.4%, respectively, as compared to 2022. The average balance of our Loan portfolio increased 5.0% as compared to 2022.

•
An increase in the initial spread on Consumer Loan assignments

The initial spread increased to 21.3% compared to 20.1% on Consumer Loans assigned in 2022.
•
An increase in our average cost of debt

Our average cost of debt increased from 3.6% to 5.5%, primarily as a result of higher interest rates on recently completed or extended secured financings and the repayment of older secured financings with lower interest rates. 
•
A decrease in common shares outstanding due to stock repurchases
We repurchased 0.4 million shares, or 2.8% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of the year.
Critical Success Factors
Critical success factors include our ability to accurately forecast Consumer Loan performance, access capital on acceptable terms, and maintain or grow Consumer Loan volume at the level and on the terms that we anticipate, with the objective to maximize economic profit over the long term. Economic profit is a non-GAAP financial measure we use to evaluate our financial results and determine profit-sharing for team members. We also use economic profit as a framework to evaluate business decisions and strategies. Economic profit measures how efficiently we utilize our total capital, both debt and equity, and is a function of the return on capital in excess of the cost of capital and the amount of capital invested in the business. 
29
Consumer Loan Metrics
At the time a Consumer Loan is submitted to us for assignment, we forecast future expected cash flows from the Consumer Loan. Based on the amount and timing of these forecasts and expected expense levels, an advance or one-time purchase payment is made to the related Dealer at a price designed to maximize economic profit.
We use a statistical model to estimate the expected collection rate for each Consumer Loan at the time of assignment. We continue to evaluate the expected collection rate for each Consumer Loan subsequent to assignment. Our evaluation becomes more accurate as the Consumer Loans age, as we use actual performance data in our forecast. By comparing our current expected collection rate for each Consumer Loan with the rate we projected at the time of assignment, we are able to assess the accuracy of our initial forecast. The following table compares our aggregated forecast of Consumer Loan collection rates as of December 31, 2024, with the aggregated forecasts as of December 31, 2023, as of December 31, 2022, and at the time of assignment, segmented by year of assignment:

Represents the total forecasted collections we expect to collect on the Consumer Loans as a percentage of the repayments that we were contractually owed on the Consumer Loans at the time of assignment. Contractual repayments include both principal and interest. Forecasted collection rates are negatively impacted by canceled Consumer Loans as the contractual amount owed is not removed from the denominator for purposes of computing forecasted collection rates.
Consumer Loans assigned in 2018 through 2020 have yielded forecasted collection results significantly better than our initial estimates, while Consumer Loans assigned in 2015, 2016, and 2021 through 2023 have yielded forecasted collection results significantly worse than our initial estimates. For all other assignment years presented, actual results have been close to our initial estimates.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, forecasted collection rates improved for Consumer Loans assigned in 2019, declined for Consumer Loans assigned in 2021 through 2024, and were generally consistent with expectations at the start of the period for all other assignment years presented.
For the year ended December 31, 2023, forecasted collection rates improved for Consumer Loans assigned in 2018 and 2019, declined for Consumer Loans assigned in 2020 through 2022, and were generally consistent with expectations at the start of the period for all other assignment years presented.
The changes in forecasted collection rates impacted forecasted net cash flows (forecasted collections less forecasted Dealer Holdback payments) as follows:

During the second quarter of 2024, we applied an adjustment to our methodology for forecasting the amount of future net cash flows from our Loan portfolio, which reduced the forecasted collection rates for Consumer Loans assigned in 2022 through 2024. Consumer Loans assigned in 2022 had continued to underperform our expectations for several quarters. Consumer Loans assigned in 2023 had also begun exhibiting similar trends of underperformance, although not as severe as Consumer Loans assigned in 2022. During the second quarter of 2024, we determined that we had sufficient Consumer Loan performance experience to estimate the magnitude by which we expected Consumer Loans assigned in 2022 through 2024 would likely underperform our historical collection rates on Consumer Loans with similar characteristics. Accordingly, we applied an adjustment to Consumer Loans assigned in 2022 through 2024 to reduce forecasted collection rates to what we believed the ultimate collection rates would be based on these trends. Changes in the amount and timing of forecasted net cash flows are recognized in the period of change as a provision for credit losses. The implementation of this forecast adjustment during the second quarter of 2024 reduced forecasted net cash flows by $147.2 million, or 1.4%, and increased provision for credit losses by $127.5 million.
During the second quarter of 2023, we adjusted our methodology for forecasting the amount and timing of future net cash flows from our Loan portfolio through the utilization of more recent Consumer Loan performance and Consumer Loan prepayment data. We had experienced a decrease in Consumer Loan prepayments to below-average levels and, as a result, slowed our forecasted net cash flow timing. Historically, Consumer Loan prepayments have been lower in periods with less availability of consumer credit. Changes in the amount and timing of forecasted net cash flows are recognized in the period of change as a provision for credit losses. The implementation of the adjustment to our forecasting methodology during the second quarter of 2023 reduced forecasted net cash flows by $44.5 million, or 0.5%, and increased provision for credit losses by $71.3 million.
We have experienced increased levels of uncertainty associated with our estimate of the amount and timing of future net cash flows from our Loan portfolio since the beginning of 2020, with realized collections underperforming our expectations during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, outperforming our expectations following the distribution of federal stimulus payments and enhanced unemployment benefits, and underperforming our expectations during the current economic environment. The quarterly changes to our forecast of future net cash flows from our Loan portfolio for the period from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2024 are shown in the following table:

(2)
Represents advances paid to Dealers on Consumer Loans assigned under the Portfolio Program and one-time payments made to Dealers to purchase Consumer Loans assigned under the Purchase Program.  Payments of Dealer Holdback and accelerated Dealer Holdback are not included.
The profitability of our loans is primarily driven by the amount and timing of the net cash flows we receive from the spread between the forecasted collection rate and the advance rate, less operating expenses and the cost of capital. Forecasting collection rates accurately at Loan inception is difficult. With this in mind, we establish advance rates that are intended to allow us to achieve acceptable levels of profitability across our portfolio, even if collection rates are less than we initially forecast.
The following table presents aggregate forecasted Consumer Loan collection rates, advance rates, and spreads (the forecasted collection rate less the advance rate), and the percentage of the forecasted collections that had been realized as of December 31, 2024, as well as forecasted collection rates and spreads at the time of assignment. All amounts, unless otherwise noted, are presented as a percentage of the initial balance of the Consumer Loan (principal + interest). The table includes both Dealer Loans and Purchased Loans.

The risk of a material change in our forecasted collection rate declines as the Consumer Loans age. For 2020 and prior Consumer Loan assignments, the risk of a material forecast variance is modest, as we have currently realized in excess of 90% of the expected collections. Conversely, the forecasted collection rates for more recent Consumer Loan assignments are less certain as a significant portion of our forecast has not been realized.
The spread between the forecasted collection rate as of December 31, 2024 and the advance rate ranges from 12.8% to 23.8% for Consumer Loans assigned over the last 10 years. The spreads with respect to 2019 and 2020 Consumer Loans have been positively impacted by Consumer Loan performance, which has exceeded our initial estimates by a greater margin than the other years presented. The spread with respect to 2022 Consumer Loans has been negatively impacted by Consumer Loan performance, which has been lower than our initial estimates by a greater margin than the other years presented. The higher spread for 2024 Consumer Loans relative to 2023 Consumer Loans as of December 31, 2024 was primarily a result of Consumer Loan performance, as the performance of 2023 Consumer Loans has been lower than our initial estimates by a greater margin than 2024 Consumer Loans. Additionally, 2024 Consumer Loans had a higher initial spread, which was primarily due to a decrease in the advance rate.

(1)    The forecasted collection rates presented for Dealer Loans and Purchased Loans reflect the Consumer Loan classification at the time of assignment. The forecasted collection rates represent the total forecasted collections we expect to collect on the Consumer Loans as a percentage of the repayments that we were contractually owed on the Consumer Loans at the time of assignment.  Contractual repayments include both principal and interest. Forecasted collection rates are negatively impacted by canceled Consumer Loans as the contractual amount owed is not removed from the denominator for purposes of computing forecasted collection rates.

The following table presents aggregate forecasted Consumer Loan collection rates, advance rates, and spreads (the forecasted collection rate less the advance rate) as of December 31, 2024 for Dealer Loans and Purchased Loans separately. All amounts are presented as a percentage of the initial balance of the Consumer Loan (principal + interest).

Represents advances paid to Dealers on Consumer Loans assigned under the Portfolio Program and one-time payments made to Dealers to purchase Consumer Loans assigned under the Purchase Program as a percentage of the initial balance of the Consumer Loans. Payments of Dealer Holdback and accelerated Dealer Holdback are not included.
Although the advance rate on Purchased Loans is higher as compared to the advance rate on Dealer Loans, Purchased Loans do not require us to pay Dealer Holdback.
The spread as of December 31, 2024 on 2024 Dealer Loans was 21.3%, as compared to a spread of 18.3% on 2023 Dealer Loans. The increase was primarily due to Consumer Loan performance, as the performance of 2023 Dealer Loans has been lower than our initial estimates by a greater margin than 2024 Dealer Loans.
The spread as of December 31, 2024 on 2024 Purchased Loans was 21.8%, as compared to a spread of 17.9% on 2023 Purchased Loans. The increase was primarily a result of a higher initial spread on 2024 Purchased Loans, due to a higher initial forecast and lower advance rate. Additionally, the performance of 2023 Purchased Loans has been lower than our initial estimates.
Access to Capital
Our strategy for accessing capital on acceptable terms needed to maintain and grow the business is to: (1) maintain consistent financial performance; (2) maintain modest financial leverage; and (3) maintain multiple funding sources. Our funded debt to equity ratio was 3.6 to 1 as of December 31, 2024. We currently utilize the following primary forms of debt financing: (1) our revolving secured line of credit facility; (2) Warehouse facilities; (3) Term ABS financings; and (4) senior notes.

Represents advances paid to Dealers on Consumer Loans assigned under the Portfolio Program and one-time payments made to Dealers to purchase Consumer Loans assigned under the Purchase Program.  Payments of Dealer Holdback and accelerated Dealer Holdback are not included.
Consumer Loan assignment volumes depend on a number of factors including (1) the overall demand for our financing programs, (2) the amount of capital available to fund new Loans, and (3) our assessment of the volume that our infrastructure can support. Our pricing strategy is intended to maximize the amount of economic profit we generate, within the confines of capital and infrastructure constraints.
During 2024, unit and dollar volumes increased 16.1% and 11.3%, respectively, as the number of active Dealers increased 9.1% while average volume per active Dealer increased 6.4%. Dollar volume increased less than unit volume in 2024 due to a decrease in the average advance paid, due to decreases in the average advance rate and the average size of Consumer Loans assigned. Unit volume for 2024 was the highest unit volume in our history. 
During 2023, unit and dollar volumes increased 18.6% and 14.4%, respectively, as the number of active Dealers increased 19.1% while average volume per active Dealer decreased 0.4%. Dollar volume increased less than unit volume in 2023 due to a decrease in the average advance paid, due to decreases in the average advance rate and the average size of Consumer Loans assigned.

Results of Operations
The following is a discussion of our 2024 and 2023 results of operations and income statement data on a consolidated basis, including year-to-year comparisons between 2024 and 2023. Discussions of 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.
The net Loan income (finance charge revenue less provision for credit losses expense) that we recognize over the life of a Loan equals the cash we collect from the underlying Consumer Loan less the cash we pay to the Dealer. We believe the economics of our business are best exhibited by recognizing net Loan income on a level-yield basis over the life of the Loan based on expected future net cash flows. Under the GAAP methodology we employ, which is known as the current expected credit loss model, or CECL, we are required to recognize:
•
a significant provision for credit losses expense at the time of the Loan’s assignment to us for contractual net cash flows we do not expect to realize; and
•
finance charge revenue in subsequent periods that is significantly in excess of our expected yields.
Due to the GAAP treatment of contractual net cash flows we do not expect to realize at the time of loan assignment (i.e. significant expense at the time of loan assignment, which is offset by higher revenue in subsequent periods), we do not believe the GAAP methodology we employ provides sufficient transparency into the economics of our business, including our results of operations, financial condition, and financial leverage. For additional information, see Note 2 and Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.

$
237.3 
The increase in the average net Loans receivable balance was primarily due to the dollar volume of new Consumer Loan assignments exceeding the principal collected on Loans receivable. 
Premiums Earned. 
The increase of $16.5 million, or 20.7%, was primarily due to growth in the size of our reinsurance portfolio, which resulted from growth in new Consumer Loan assignments and an increase in the average premium written per reinsured vehicle service contract in recent periods.
Operating Expenses
. The increase of $42.4 million, or 9.2%, was primarily due to:
•
An increase in salaries and wages expense of $29.0 million, or 10.3%, primarily due to increases in (i) the number of team members as we are investing in our business with the goal of increasing the speed at which we enhance our product for Dealers and consumers, (ii) fringe benefits, primarily due to higher medical claims, and (iii) stock-based compensation expense, primarily due to equity awards granted to our executive officers and senior leaders.
▪
An increase in general and administrative expense of $10.7 million, or 12.3%, primarily due to increases in legal and technology systems expenses.
Provision for Credit Losses
. The increase of $78.5 million, or 10.7%, was primarily due to an increase in provision for credit losses on forecast changes.
We recognize provision for credit losses on new Consumer Loan assignments for contractual net cash flows that are not expected to be realized at the time of assignment. We also recognize provision for credit losses on forecast changes in the amount and timing of expected future net cash flows subsequent to assignment. The following table summarizes the provision for credit losses for each of these components:

The increase in provision for credit losses related to forecast changes was due to a greater decline in Consumer Loan performance during 2024 compared to 2023 and slower net cash flow timing during 2024 compared to 2023.
During 2024, we decreased our estimate of future net cash flows by $314.0 million, or 3.1%, to reflect a decline in forecasted collection rates during the period and slowed our forecasted net cash flow timing to reflect a decrease in Consumer Loan prepayments, which remain below historical averages. Historically, Consumer Loan prepayments have been lower in periods with less availability of consumer credit. The $314.0 million decrease in forecasted net cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2024 was composed of an ordinary decrease in forecasted net cash flows of $166.8 million, or 1.7%, and an adjustment applied to our forecasting methodology during the second quarter of 2024, which upon implementation, reduced forecasted net cash flows by $147.2 million, or 1.4%, and increased our provision for credit losses by $127.5 million. Consumer Loans assigned in 2022 had continued to underperform our expectations for several quarters. Consumer Loans assigned in 2023 had also begun exhibiting similar trends of underperformance, although not as severe as Consumer Loans assigned in 2022. During the second quarter of 2024, we determined that we had sufficient Consumer Loan performance experience to estimate the magnitude by which we expected Consumer Loans assigned in 2022 through 2024 would likely underperform our historical collection rates on Consumer Loans with similar characteristics. Accordingly, we applied an adjustment to Consumer Loans assigned in 2022 through 2024 to reduce forecasted collection rates to what we believed the ultimate collection rates would be based on these trends.
38
During 2023, we decreased our estimate of future net cash flows by $206.3 million, or 2.3%, to reflect a decline in Consumer Loan prepayments to below-average levels. The $206.3 million decrease in forecasted net cash flows during 2023 was composed of an ordinary decrease in forecasted net cash flows of $161.8 million, or 1.8%, and an adjustment to our forecasting methodology during the second quarter of 2023, which, upon implementation, decreased our estimate of future net cash flows by $44.5 million, or 0.5%, and increased our provision for credit losses by $71.3 million. We adjusted our methodology for forecasting the amount and timing of future net cash flows from our Loan portfolio through the utilization of more recent Consumer Loan performance and Consumer Loan prepayment data. 
For additional information, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.
The decrease in provision for credit losses related to new Consumer Loan assignments was due to a 14.3% decrease in the average provision per new Consumer Loan assignment, partially offset by a 16.1% increase in Consumer Loan assignment unit volume. The decrease in average provision per new Consumer Loan assignment was primarily due to a decrease in the average advance rate for 2024 Consumer Loans and a lower percentage of Purchased Loans in the mix of Consumer Loan assignments received during 2024. 
Interest. 
The increase in interest expense of $153.0 million, or 57.4%, was due to:
•
An increase in our average cost of debt, which increased interest expense by $93.7 million, primarily as a result of higher interest rates on recently completed or extended secured financings and recently issued senior notes and the repayment of older secured financings and senior notes with lower interest rates.
•
An increase in our average outstanding debt balance, which increased interest expense by $59.3 million, primarily due to borrowings used to fund the growth of our Loan portfolio and stock repurchases.

Loss on Sale of Building. 
For the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized a loss on the sale of a building of $23.7 million. For additional information, see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Provision for Income Taxes. 
For the year ended December 31, 2024, the effective income tax rate increased to 24.8% from 22.2% for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to:
•
A decrease in the impact of excess tax benefits on our effective income tax rate, primarily due to the timing of long-term stock award grants.
•
An increase in non-deductible executive compensation expense.
•
An increase in the impact of state and local income taxes on our effective income tax rate, primarily due to an adjustment to an uncertain tax position estimate during the second quarter of 2024 and changes in state tax laws that were enacted during the second quarter of 2024.
 For additional information, see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Critical Accounting Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we review our accounting policies, assumptions, estimates, and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP.
Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and involve a high degree of subjective or complex judgment, and the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce materially different financial results.

We estimate the amount and timing of future collections and Dealer Holdback payments. These estimates impact Loans receivable and allowance for credit losses on our balance sheet and finance charges and provision for credit losses on our income statement.
Assumptions and Approaches Used. 
On January 1, 2020, we adopted Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which is known as the current expected credit loss model, or CECL. For additional information regarding the adoption impact of CECL, see Note 2 and Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.
We recognize finance charges under the interest method such that revenue is recognized on a level-yield basis over the life of the Loan. We calculate finance charges on a monthly basis by applying the effective interest rate of the Loan to the net carrying amount of the Loan (Loan receivable less the related allowance for credit losses). For Consumer Loans assigned on or subsequent to January 1, 2020, the effective interest rate is based on contractual future net cash flows. Consumer Loans assigned prior to January 1, 2020 are no longer material to our consolidated financial statements.
The outstanding balance of the allowance for credit losses of each Loan represents the amount required to reduce the net carrying amount of Loans (Loans receivable less allowance for credit losses) to the present value of expected future net cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate. Expected future net cash flows for Dealer Loans are comprised of expected future collections on the assigned Consumer Loans, less any expected future Dealer Holdback payments. Expected future net cash flows for Purchased Loans are comprised of expected future collections on the assigned Consumer Loans.
Expected future collections are forecasted for each individual Consumer Loan based on the historical performance of Consumer Loans with similar characteristics, adjusted for recent trends in payment patterns. Our forecast of expected future collections includes estimates for prepayments and post-contractual-term cash flows. Unless the consumer is no longer contractually obligated to pay us, we forecast future collections on each Consumer Loan for a 120 month period after the origination date. Expected future Dealer Holdback payments are forecasted for each individual Dealer based on the expected future collections and current advance balance of each Dealer Loan.
We monitor and evaluate Consumer Loan performance on a monthly basis by comparing our current forecasted collection rates to our initial expectations. We use a statistical model that considers a number of credit quality indicators to estimate the expected collection rate for each Consumer Loan at the time of assignment. The credit quality indicators considered in our model include attributes contained in the consumer’s credit bureau report, data contained in the consumer’s credit application, the structure of the proposed transaction, vehicle information, and other factors. We continue to evaluate the expected collection rate for each Consumer Loan subsequent to assignment primarily through the monitoring of consumer payment behavior. Our evaluation becomes more accurate as the Consumer Loans age, as we use actual performance data in our forecast. Since all known, significant credit quality indicators have already been factored into our forecasts and pricing, we are not able to use any specific credit quality indicators to predict or explain variances in actual performance from our initial expectations. Any variances in performance from our initial expectations are the result of Consumer Loans performing differently from historical Consumer Loans with similar characteristics. We periodically adjust our statistical pricing model for new trends that we identify through our evaluation of these forecasted collection rate variances.

During the second quarter of 2024, we applied an adjustment to our methodology for forecasting the amount of future net cash flows from our Loan portfolio, which reduced the forecasted collection rates for Consumer Loans assigned in 2022 through 2024. Consumer Loans assigned in 2022 had continued to underperform our expectations for several quarters. Consumer Loans assigned in 2023 had also begun exhibiting similar trends of underperformance, although not as severe as Consumer Loans assigned in 2022. During the second quarter of 2024, we determined that we had sufficient Consumer Loan performance experience to estimate the magnitude by which we expected Consumer Loans assigned in 2022 through 2024 would likely underperform our historical collection rates on Consumer Loans with similar characteristics. Accordingly, we applied an adjustment to Consumer Loans assigned in 2022 through 2024 to reduce forecasted collection rates to what we believed the ultimate collection rates would be based on these trends. Changes in the amount and timing of forecasted net cash flows are recognized in the period of change as a provision for credit losses. The implementation of this forecast adjustment during the second quarter of 2024 reduced forecasted net cash flows by $147.2 million, or 1.4%, and increased provision for credit losses by $127.5 million.
During the second quarter of 2023, we adjusted our methodology for forecasting the amount and timing of future net cash flows from our Loan portfolio through the utilization of more recent Consumer Loan performance and Consumer Loan prepayment data. We had experienced a decrease in Consumer Loan prepayments to below-average levels and, as a result, slowed our forecasted net cash flow timing. The below-average levels of Consumer Loan prepayments continued through the fourth quarter of 2023. Historically, Consumer Loan prepayments have been lower in periods with less availability of consumer credit. Changes in the amount and timing of forecasted net cash flows are recognized in the period of change as a provision for credit losses. The implementation of the adjustment to our forecasting methodology during the second quarter of 2023 reduced forecasted net cash flows by $44.5 million, or 0.5%, and increased provision for credit losses by $71.3 million. 
The COVID-19 pandemic created conditions that increased the level of uncertainty associated with our estimate of the amount and timing of future net cash flows from our Loan portfolio. During the first quarter of 2020, we applied a subjective adjustment to our forecasting model to reflect our best estimate of the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future net cash flows (“COVID forecast adjustment”), which reduced our estimate of future net cash flows by $162.2 million. We continued to apply the COVID forecast adjustment through the end of 2021, as it continued to represent our best estimate.  During the first quarter of 2022, we determined that we had sufficient Consumer Loan performance experience since the lapse of federal stimulus payments and enhanced unemployment benefits to refine our estimate of future net cash flows. Accordingly, during the first quarter of 2022, we removed the COVID forecast adjustment and enhanced our methodology for forecasting the amount and timing of future net cash flows from our Loan portfolio through the utilization of more recent data and new forecast variables. Under CECL, changes in the amount and timing of forecasted net cash flows are recorded as a provision for credit losses in the period of change.
The removal of the COVID forecast adjustment and the implementation of the enhanced forecasting methodology during the first quarter of 2022 impacted forecasted net cash flows and provision for credit losses as follows:

Our provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2024, included:
•
$320.9 million provision for credit losses on new Consumer Loan assignments, which reduced consolidated net income by $247.1 million, or $19.82 per diluted share; and
•
$493.8 million provision for credit losses on forecast changes related to changes in the amount and timing of expected future net cash flows, which reduced consolidated net income by $380.2 million, or $30.49 per diluted share.
Our provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2023, included:
•
$322.5 million provision for credit losses on new Consumer Loan assignments, which reduced consolidated net income by $248.3 million, or $19.08 per diluted share; and
•
$413.7 million provision for credit losses on forecast changes related to changes in the amount and timing of expected future net cash flows, which reduced consolidated net income by $318.5 million, or $24.48 per diluted share.
41
Key Factors. 
Variances in the amount and timing of future net cash flows from current estimates could materially impact earnings in future periods. A 1% decline in the forecasted future net cash flows on Loans as of December 31, 2024 would have reduced 2024 consolidated net income by approximately $59.7 million.
During periods of economic slowdown or recession, delinquencies, defaults, repossessions, and losses may increase on our Consumer Loans, and Consumer Loan prepayments may decline. These periods are also typically accompanied by decreased consumer demand for automobiles and declining values of automobiles securing outstanding Consumer Loans, which weakens collateral coverage and increases the amount of a loss in the event of default. Significant increases in the inventory of used automobiles during periods of economic recession may also depress the prices at which repossessed automobiles may be sold or delay the timing of these sales. Additionally, inflation, higher gasoline prices, the deferral or resumption of student loan payments, increased focus on climate-related initiatives and regulation, declining stock market values, unstable real estate values, resets of adjustable rate mortgages to higher interest rates, increasing unemployment levels, general availability of consumer credit, or other factors that impact consumer confidence or disposable income could increase loss frequency and decrease consumer demand for automobiles as well as weaken collateral values of automobiles. Because our business is focused on consumers who do not qualify for conventional automobile financing, the actual rates of delinquencies, defaults, repossessions, and losses on our Consumer Loans could be higher than those experienced in the general automobile finance industry and could be more dramatically affected by a general economic downturn.
Premiums Earned
Nature of Estimates Required. 
We estimate the pattern of future claims on vehicle service contracts. These estimates impact accounts payable and accrued liabilities on our balance sheet and premiums earned on our income statement.
Assumptions and Approaches Used. 
Premiums from the reinsurance of vehicle service contracts are recognized over the life of the policy in proportion to the expected costs of servicing those contracts. Expected costs are determined based on our historical claims experience. In developing our cost expectations, we stratify our historical claims experience into groupings based on contractual term, as this characteristic has led to different patterns of cost incurrence in the past. We will continue to update our analysis of historical costs under the vehicle service contract program as appropriate, including the consideration of other characteristics that may have led to different patterns of cost incurrence, and revise our revenue recognition timing for any changes in the pattern of our expected costs as they are identified.
Key Factors. 
Variances in the pattern of future claims from our current estimates would impact the timing of premiums recognized in future periods. A 10% change in premiums earned for the year ended December 31, 2024 would have affected 2024 consolidated net income by approximately $7.4 million.
Contingencies
Nature of Estimates Required. 
We estimate the likelihood of adverse judgments against us and any resulting damages, fines, or statutory penalties owed. These estimates impact accounts payable and accrued liabilities on our balance sheet and are general and administrative expenses on our income statement.
Assumptions and Approaches Used. 
With assistance from our legal counsel, we determine if the likelihood of an adverse judgment for various claims, litigation, and regulatory investigations is remote, reasonably possible, or probable. To the extent we believe an adverse judgment is probable and the amount of the judgment is estimable, we recognize a liability. For information regarding current actions to which we are a party, see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Key Factors. 
Negative variances in the ultimate disposition of claims and litigation outstanding from current estimates could result in additional expense in future periods.
42
Uncertain Tax Positions
Nature of Estimates Required. 
We estimate the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return. These estimates impact income taxes receivable and accounts payable and accrued liabilities on our balance sheet and provision for income taxes on our income statement.
Assumptions and Approaches Used. 
We follow a two-step approach for recognizing uncertain tax positions. First, we evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. Second, for positions that we determine are more-likely-than-not to be sustained, we recognize the tax benefit as the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being sustained. We establish a reserve for uncertain tax positions liability that is comprised of unrecognized tax benefits and related interest. We adjust this liability in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position, or more information becomes available.
Key Factors. 
To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in future periods could be materially affected.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We need capital to maintain and grow our business. Our primary sources of capital are cash flows from operating activities, collections of Consumer Loans, and borrowings under: (1) our revolving secured line of credit facility; (2) Warehouse facilities; (3) Term ABS financings; and (4) senior notes. There are various restrictive covenants to which we are subject under each financing arrangement, and we were in compliance with those covenants as of December 31, 2024. For information regarding these financings and the covenants included in the related documents, see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.
On February 16, 2024, we extended the $100.0 million Term ABS 2021-1 financing and extended the date on which the financing will cease to revolve from December 16, 2024 to February 17, 2026.
On February 27, 2024, we completed a $200.0 million Term ABS financing, which was used to repay outstanding indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. The financing has an expected average annualized cost of 7.8% (including upfront fees and other costs), and it will revolve for 36 months, after which it will amortize based upon the cash flows on the underlying Loans.
On March 28, 2024, we completed a $500.0 million Term ABS financing, which was used to repay outstanding indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. The financing has an expected average annualized cost of 6.4% (including upfront fees and other costs), and it will revolve for 24 months, after which it will amortize based upon the cash flows on the underlying Loans.
On June 17, 2024, we extended the maturity of our revolving secured line of credit facility from June 22, 2026 to June 22, 2027. The interest rate on borrowings under the facility has changed from the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index rate plus 187.5 basis points to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus 197.5 basis points.
On June 20, 2024, we completed a $550.0 million Term ABS financing, which was used to repay outstanding indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. The financing has an expected average annualized cost of 6.5% (including upfront fees and other costs), and it will revolve for 24 months, after which it will amortize based upon the cash flows on the underlying Loans.
On June 21, 2024, we increased the financing amount on the Term ABS 2022-2 financing from $200.0 million to $300.0 million and extended the date on which the financing will cease to revolve from December 15, 2025 to June 15, 2027.
On September 19, 2024, we increased the financing amount on Warehouse Facility II from $400.0 million to $500.0 million and extended the date on which the facility will cease to revolve from April 30, 2026 to September 20, 2027. The interest rate on borrowings under the facility has been decreased from SOFR plus 230 basis points to SOFR plus 185 basis points.
43
On September 19, 2024, we extended the date on which the $500.0 million Term ABS 2019-2 financing will cease to revolve from August 15, 2025 to September 15, 2026 and increased the interest rate under the financing from 5.15% to 5.43%. 
On September 26, 2024, we completed a $600.0 million Term ABS financing, which was used to repay outstanding indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. The financing has an expected average annualized cost of 5.2% (including upfront fees and other costs), and it will revolve for 24 months, after which it will amortize based upon the cash flows on the underlying Loans.
On December 5, 2024, we increased the financing amount on Warehouse Facility V from $200.0 million to $250.0 million and extended the date on which the facility will cease to revolve from December 29, 2025 to December 29, 2027. The maturity of the facility was also extended from December 27, 2027 to December 27, 2029. The interest rate on borrowings under the facility has been decreased from SOFR plus 245 basis points to SOFR plus 185 basis points.
On December 20, 2024, we completed a $300.0 million Term ABS financing, which was used to repay outstanding indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. The financing has an expected average annualized cost of 6.3% (including upfront fees and other costs), and it will revolve for 36 months, after which it will amortize based upon the cash flows on the underlying Loans.
Cash and cash equivalents increased to $343.7 million as of December 31, 2024 from $13.2 million as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had $1,734.9 million and $1,505.8 million, respectively, in unused and available lines of credit. Our total balance sheet indebtedness increased to $6,352.9 million as of December 31, 2024 from $5,067.5 million as of December 31, 2023, primarily due to the growth in new Consumer Loan assignments and stock repurchases.

The amounts presented consist solely of principal and do not reflect deferred debt issuance costs of $37.7 million and unamortized debt discount of $1.3 million. We are also obligated to make interest payments at the applicable interest rates, as discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference. Based on the actual principal amounts outstanding under our revolving secured line of credit facility, our Warehouse facilities, our Term ABS financings, and our senior notes as of December 31, 2024, the forecasted principal amounts outstanding on all other debt, and the actual interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2024, interest is expected to be approximately $397.8 million during 2025; $271.8 million during 2026; and $180.9 million during 2027 and thereafter.
(2)
We have contractual obligations to pay Dealer Holdback to Dealers. Payments of Dealer Holdback are contingent upon the receipt of consumer payments and the repayment of advances. The amounts presented represent our forecast as of December 31, 2024.
(3)
A lease liability of $1.6 million is recognized within accounts payable and accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024. 
(4)
Purchase obligations consist primarily of contractual obligations related to our information system needs.
Based upon anticipated cash flows, management believes that cash flows from operations and our various financing alternatives will provide sufficient financing for debt maturities and for future operations. Our ability to borrow funds may be impacted by economic and financial market conditions. If the various financing alternatives were to become limited or unavailable to us, our operations and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected.
Market Risk
We are exposed primarily to market risks associated with movements in interest rates. Our policies and procedures prohibit the use of financial instruments for speculative purposes. 
44
Interest Rate Risk. 
We rely on various sources of financing, some of which contain floating rates of interest and expose us to risks associated with increases in interest rates. Assuming that we maintain a level amount of floating rate debt, an increase in interest rates may result in higher interest expense for our floating rate debt facilities. From time to time, we may manage that risk through the use of derivatives such as interest rate caps.
As of December 31, 2024, we had $0.1 million of floating rate debt outstanding under our revolving secured lines of credit, without interest rate protection. For every 100-basis-point increase in interest rates on our revolving secured lines of credit, annual after-tax earnings would decrease by a negligible amount, assuming we maintain a level amount of floating rate debt.
As of December 31, 2024, we had interest rate cap agreements outstanding to manage the interest rate risk on Warehouse Facility V and Warehouse Facility VIII. However, as of December 31, 2024, there was no floating rate debt outstanding under these facilities.
As of December 31, 2024, we did not have a balance outstanding under Warehouse Facility II, Warehouse IV, and Warehouse Facility VI, which do not have interest rate protection.  
As of December 31, 2024, we had $100.0 million in floating rate debt outstanding under Term ABS 2021-1, without interest rate protection. For every 100-basis-point increase in interest rates on Term ABS 2021-1, annual after-tax earnings would decrease by approximately $0.8 million, assuming we maintain a level amount of floating rate debt.
As of December 31, 2024, we had $300.0 million in floating rate debt outstanding under Term ABS 2022-2, without interest rate protection. For every 100-basis-point increase in interest rates on Term ABS 2022-2, annual after-tax earnings would decrease by approximately $2.3 million, assuming we maintain a level amount of floating rate debt.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Board of Directors and Shareholders
Credit Acceptance Corporation
Opinion on the financial statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Credit Acceptance Corporation (a Michigan corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), and our report dated February 12, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion.
Basis for opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical audit matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Finance Charge Revenue and Allowance for Credit Losses
As described further in Notes 2 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded $1,992.7 million in finance charge revenue for the period ended December 31, 2024 and an allowance for credit losses of $3,438.8 million on loans receivable of $11,289.1 million for a net carrying amount of loan receivables of $7,850.3 million as of December 31, 2024.
Finance charge revenue is determined by applying the effective interest rate to the net carrying amount of the loan receivable. The effective interest rate is based on contractual future net cash flows. The allowance for credit losses is then estimated by discounting the expected future net cash flows at the same effective interest used in determining finance charge revenue. Expected future net cash flows are estimated using a statistical model that considers a number of credit quality indicators to derive the amount of those expected future net cash flows. We identified finance charge revenue and allowance for credit losses as a critical audit matter.
47
The principal considerations for our determination that finance charge revenue and allowance for credit losses is a critical audit matter are the high degree of estimation uncertainty in management’s modeling of expected future net cash flows. Management’s statistical model used to determine expected future net cash flows required complex auditor judgment to evaluate the reasonableness of the outcomes of the model and the involvement of those with specialized skill and knowledge.
Our audit procedures related to the finance charge revenue and allowance for credit losses included the following, among others:
•
We tested the design and operating effectiveness of management’s review control over model performance variances between actual and expected future net cash flows.
•
We tested the design and operating effectiveness of management’s review control over their statistical model used to determine expected future net cash flows which verifies the statistical model is operating as intended.
•
For a sample of loans, we selected loan specific credit quality indicators used in the statistical model and agreed those credit quality indicators to source documents in order to recalculate the expected future net cash flows produced by the statistical model.
•
We involved those with specialized skill and knowledge to assess the conceptual soundness of the statistical model’s design and management’s validation to accurately determine estimated future net cash flows.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.     DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Principal Business. 
Credit Acceptance Corporation (referred to as the “Company”, “Credit Acceptance”, “we”, “our” or “us”) makes vehicle ownership possible by providing innovative financing solutions that enable automobile dealers to sell vehicles to consumers, regardless of their credit history. Our financing programs are offered through a nationwide network of automobile dealers who benefit from sales of vehicles to consumers who otherwise could not obtain financing; from repeat and referral sales generated by these same customers; and from sales to customers responding to advertisements for our financing programs, but who actually end up qualifying for traditional financing.
Without our financing programs, consumers are often unable to purchase vehicles or they purchase unreliable ones. Further, as we report to the three national credit reporting agencies, an important ancillary benefit of our programs is that we provide consumers with an opportunity to improve their lives by improving their credit score and move on to more traditional sources of financing.
We refer to automobile dealers who participate in our programs and who share our desire to provide an opportunity to consumers to improve their lives as “Dealers.” Upon enrollment in our financing programs, the Dealer enters into a Dealer servicing agreement with us that defines the legal relationship between Credit Acceptance and the Dealer. The Dealer servicing agreement assigns the responsibilities for administering, servicing, and collecting the amounts due on retail installment contracts (referred to as “Consumer Loans”) from the Dealers to us. We are an indirect lender from a legal perspective, meaning the Consumer Loan is originated by the Dealer and assigned to us. 
The majority of the Consumer Loans assigned to us are made to consumers with impaired or limited credit histories. 
The following table shows the percentage of Consumer Loans assigned to us with either FICO

We have 
two
 programs: the Portfolio Program and the Purchase Program. Under the Portfolio Program, we advance money to Dealers (referred to as a “Dealer Loan”) in exchange for the right to service the underlying Consumer Loans. Under the Purchase Program, we buy the Consumer Loans from the Dealers (referred to as a “Purchased Loan”) and keep all amounts collected from the consumer. Dealer Loans and Purchased Loans are collectively referred to as “Loans.”

Represents advances paid to Dealers on Consumer Loans assigned under the Portfolio Program and one-time payments made to Dealers to purchase Consumer Loans assigned under the Purchase Program. Payments of Dealer Holdback (as defined below) and accelerated Dealer Holdback are not included.
Portfolio Program
As payment for the vehicle, the Dealer generally receives the following:
•
a down payment from the consumer;
•
a non-recourse cash payment (“advance”) from us; and
•
after the advance balance (cash advance and related Dealer Loan fees and costs) has been recovered by us, the cash from payments made on the Consumer Loan, net of certain collection costs and our servicing fee (“Dealer Holdback”).
54
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (CONTINUED)
We record the amount advanced to the Dealer as a Dealer Loan, which is classified within Loans receivable in our consolidated balance sheets. Cash advanced to the Dealer is automatically assigned to the Dealer’s open pool of advances. Dealers make an election as to how many Consumer Loans (either 
50
 or 
100
) will be assigned to an open pool before it is closed, and subsequent advances are assigned to a new pool. Unless we receive a request from the Dealer to keep a pool open, we automatically close each pool based on the Dealer’s election. All advances within a Dealer’s pool are secured by the future collections on the related Consumer Loans assigned to the pool. For Dealers with more than one pool, the pools are cross-collateralized so the performance of other pools is considered in determining eligibility for Dealer Holdback. We perfect our security interest with respect to the Dealer Loans by obtaining control or taking possession of the Consumer Loans, which list us as lien holder on the vehicle title.
The Dealer servicing agreement provides that collections received by us during a calendar month on Consumer Loans assigned by a Dealer are applied on a pool-by-pool basis as follows:
•
first, to reimburse us for certain collection costs;
•
second, to pay us our servicing fee, which generally equals 
20
% of collections;
•
third, to reduce the aggregate advance balance and to pay any other amounts due from the Dealer to us; and
•
fourth, to the Dealer as payment of Dealer Holdback.
If the collections on Consumer Loans from a Dealer’s pool are not sufficient to repay the advance balance and any other amounts due to us, the Dealer will not receive Dealer Holdback. Certain events may also result in Dealers forfeiting their rights to Dealer Holdback, including becoming inactive before assigning 
100
 Consumer Loans.
Dealers have an opportunity to receive an accelerated Dealer Holdback payment each time a pool of Consumer Loans is closed. The amount paid to the Dealer is calculated using a formula that considers the number of Consumer Loans assigned to the pool and the related forecasted collections and advance balance.
Since typically the combination of the advance and the consumer’s down payment provides the Dealer with a cash profit at the time of sale, the Dealer’s risk in the Consumer Loan is limited. We cannot demand repayment of the advance from the Dealer except in the event the Dealer is in default of the Dealer servicing agreement. Advances are made only after the consumer and Dealer have signed a Consumer Loan contract, we have received the executed Consumer Loan contract and supporting documentation in either physical or electronic form, and we have approved all of the related stipulations for funding. 
For accounting purposes, the transactions described under the Portfolio Program are not considered to be loans to consumers. Instead, our accounting reflects that of a lender to the Dealer. The classification as a Dealer Loan for accounting purposes is primarily a result of (1) the Dealer’s financial interest in the Consumer Loan and (2) certain elements of our legal relationship with the Dealer.
Purchase Program
The Purchase Program differs from the Portfolio Program in that the Dealer receives a one-time payment from us at the time of assignment to purchase the Consumer Loan instead of a cash advance at the time of assignment and future Dealer Holdback payments. For accounting purposes, the transactions described under the Purchase Program are considered to be originated by the Dealer and then purchased by us.
Program Enrollment
Dealers are granted access to the Portfolio Program upon enrollment. Access to the Purchase Program is typically only granted to Dealers that meet one of the following:
•
assigned at least 
50
 Consumer Loans under the Portfolio Program;
•
franchise dealership; or
•
independent dealership that meets certain criteria upon enrollment.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and our wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Our primary subsidiaries as of December 31, 2024 are: Buyer’s Vehicle Protection Plan, Inc. (“BVPP”), Vehicle Remarketing Services, Inc. (“VRS”), VSC Re Company (“VSC Re”), CAC Warehouse Funding LLC II, CAC Warehouse Funding LLC IV, CAC Warehouse Funding LLC V, CAC Warehouse Funding LLC VI, CAC Warehouse Funding LLC VIII, Credit Acceptance Funding LLC 2019-2, Credit Acceptance Funding LLC 2021-1, Credit Acceptance Funding LLC 2021-4, Credit Acceptance Funding LLC 2022-1, Credit Acceptance Funding LLC 2022-2, Credit Acceptance Funding LLC 2022-3, Credit Acceptance Funding LLC 2023-1, Credit Acceptance Funding LLC 2023-2, Credit Acceptance Funding LLC 2023-3, Credit Acceptance Funding LLC 2023-A, Credit Acceptance Funding LLC 2023-5, Credit Acceptance Funding LLC 2024-A, Credit Acceptance Funding LLC 2024-1, Credit Acceptance Funding LLC 2024-2, Credit Acceptance Funding LLC 2024-3, and Credit Acceptance Funding LLC 2024-B.
Business Segment Information
We currently operate in 
one
 reportable segment which represents our core business of offering innovative financing solutions that enable automobile dealers to sell vehicles to consumers regardless of their credit history. For information regarding our 
one
 reportable segment and related entity wide disclosures, see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The accounts which are subject to significant estimation include the allowance for credit losses, finance charge revenue, premiums earned, contingencies, and uncertain tax positions. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents consist of readily marketable securities with original maturities at the date of acquisition of three months or less. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $
342.7
 million and $
12.8
 million, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents that were not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”).
Restricted cash and cash equivalents consist of cash pledged as collateral for secured financings and cash held in a trust for future vehicle service contract claims. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $
497.0
 million and $
453.7
 million, respectively, in restricted cash and cash equivalents that were not insured by the FDIC.
The following table provides a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents reported in our consolidated balance sheets to the total shown in our consolidated statements of cash flows:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (CONTINUED)
Restricted Securities Available for Sale
Restricted securities available for sale consist of amounts held in a trust for future vehicle service contract claims. We determine the appropriate classification of our investments in debt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such determinations at each balance sheet date. Debt securities for which we do not have the intent or ability to hold to maturity are classified as available for sale, and stated at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of income taxes included in the determination of comprehensive income and reported as a component of shareholders’ equity.
Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses
Consumer Loan Assignment. 
For legal purposes, a Consumer Loan is considered to have been assigned to us after the following has occurred:
•
the consumer and Dealer have signed a Consumer Loan contract; and
•
we have received the executed Consumer Loan contract and supporting documentation in either physical or electronic form.
For accounting and financial reporting purposes, a Consumer Loan is considered to have been assigned to us after the following has occurred:
•
the Consumer Loan has been legally assigned to us; and
•
we have made a funding decision and generally have provided funding to the Dealer in the form of either an advance under the Portfolio Program or one-time purchase payment under the Purchase Program.
Portfolio Segments and Classes.
 Our Loan portfolio consists of two portfolio segments: Dealer Loans and Purchased Loans. Our determination is based on the following:
•
We have two financing programs: the Portfolio Program and the Purchase Program. We are considered to be a lender to Dealers for Consumer Loans assigned under the Portfolio Program and a purchaser of Consumer Loans assigned under the Purchase Program. 
•
The Portfolio Program and the Purchase Program have different levels of risk in relation to credit losses. Under the Portfolio Program, the impact of negative variances in Consumer Loan performance is mitigated by Dealer Holdback and the cross-collateralization of Consumer Loan assignments. Under the Purchase Program, we are impacted by the full amount of negative variances in Consumer Loan performance.
•
Our business model is narrowly focused on Consumer Loan assignments from one industry with expected cash flows that are significantly lower than the contractual cash flows owed to us due to credit quality. We do not believe that it is meaningful to disaggregate our Loan portfolio beyond the Dealer Loans and Purchased Loans portfolio segments.
Each portfolio segment consists of one class of Consumer Loan assignments, which is Consumer Loans originated by Dealers to finance purchases of vehicles and related ancillary products by consumers with impaired or limited credit histories. Our determination is based on the following:
•
All of the Consumer Loans assigned to us have similar risk characteristics in relation to the categorization of borrowers, type of financing receivable, industry sector, and type of collateral.
•
We only accept Consumer Loan assignments from Dealers located within the United States. 
Recognition and Measurement Policy.
 On January 1, 2020, we adopted Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which is known as the current expected credit loss model, or CECL. Loans outstanding prior to the adoption date are no longer material to our consolidated financial statements. Consumer Loans assigned to us on or subsequent to January 1, 2020 are accounted for as originated financial assets (“Originated Method”). 
57
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (CONTINUED)
Under the Originated Method, at the time of assignment, we:
•
calculate the effective interest rate based on contractual future net cash flows; 
•
record a Loan receivable equal to the advance paid to the Dealer under the Portfolio Program or purchase price paid to the Dealer under the Purchase Program; and 
•
record an allowance for credit losses equal to the difference between the initial Loan receivable balance and the present value of expected future net cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate. The initial allowance for credit losses is recognized as provision for credit losses expense. 
The effective interest rate and initial allowance for credit losses are significantly higher for Consumer Loans assigned under the Purchase Program than for Consumer Loans assigned under the Portfolio Program, as contractual net cash flows exceed expected net cash flows by a significantly greater margin under the Purchase Program. Under the Purchase Program, we retain all contractual collections that exceed our initial expectations. Under the Portfolio Program, contractual collections that exceed our initial expectations are substantially offset by additional Dealer Holdback payments.
Under the Originated Method, for each reporting period subsequent to assignment, we:
•
recognize finance charge revenue using the effective interest rate that was calculated at the time of assignment based on contractual future net cash flows; and
•
adjust the allowance for credit losses so that the net carrying amount of each Loan equals the present value of expected future net cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate. The adjustment to the allowance for credit losses is recognized as either provision for credit losses expense or a reversal of provision for credit losses expense.
Loans Receivable
. Amounts advanced to Dealers for Consumer Loans assigned under the Portfolio Program are recorded as Dealer Loans and are aggregated by Dealer for purposes of recognizing revenue and measuring credit losses. Amounts paid to Dealers for Consumer Loans assigned under the Purchase Program are recorded as Purchased Loans and, for purposes of recognizing revenue and measuring credit losses, are not aggregated.
The outstanding balance of each Loan included in Loans receivable is comprised of the following:
•
cash paid to the Dealer (or to third-party ancillary product providers on the Dealer’s behalf) for the Consumer Loan assignment (advance under the Portfolio Program or one-time purchase payment under the Purchase Program);
•
finance charges;
•
Dealer Holdback payments;
•
accelerated Dealer Holdback payments;
•
recoveries;
•
transfers in;
•
less: collections (net of certain collection costs);
•
less: write-offs; and
•
less: transfers out.
Under the Portfolio Program, certain events may result in Dealers forfeiting their rights to Dealer Holdback. We transfer the Dealer’s outstanding Dealer Loan balance and the related allowance for credit losses balance to Purchased Loans in the period this forfeiture occurs. We aggregate these Purchased Loans by Dealer for purposes of recognizing revenue and measuring credit losses.
Allowance for Credit Losses. 
The outstanding balance of the allowance for credit losses of each Loan represents the amount required to reduce net carrying amount of Loans (Loans receivable less allowance for credit losses) to the present value of expected future net cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate. Expected future net cash flows for Dealer Loans are comprised of expected future collections on the assigned Consumer Loans, less any expected future Dealer Holdback payments. Expected future net cash flows for Purchased Loans are comprised of expected future collections on the assigned Consumer Loans. 
58
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (CONTINUED)
Expected future collections are forecasted for each individual Consumer Loan based on the historical performance of Consumer Loans with similar characteristics, adjusted for recent trends in payment patterns. Our forecast of expected future collections includes estimates for prepayments and post-contractual-term cash flows. Unless the consumer is no longer contractually obligated to pay us, we forecast future collections on each Consumer Loan for a 120 month period after the origination date. Expected future Dealer Holdback payments are forecasted for each individual Dealer based on the expected future collections and current advance balance of each Dealer Loan.
We fully write off the outstanding balances of a Loan and the related allowance for credit losses once we are no longer forecasting any expected future net cash flows on the Loan. Under our partial write-off policy, we write off the amount of the outstanding balances of a Loan and the related allowance for credit losses, if any, that exceeds 200% of the present value of expected future net cash flows on the Loan, as we deem this amount to be uncollectable.
Credit Quality. 
The vast majority of the Consumer Loans assigned to us are made to individuals with impaired or limited credit histories. Consumer Loans made to these individuals generally entail a higher risk of delinquency, default, and repossession and higher losses than loans made to consumers with better credit. Since most of our revenue and cash flows are generated from these Consumer Loans, our ability to accurately forecast Consumer Loan performance is critical to our business and financial results. At the time a Consumer Loan is submitted to us for assignment, we forecast future expected cash flows from the Consumer Loan. Based on these forecasts, an advance or one-time purchase payment is made to the related Dealer at a price designed to maximize our economic profit, a non-GAAP financial measure that considers our return on capital, our cost of capital, and the amount of capital invested.
We monitor and evaluate the credit quality of Consumer Loans on a monthly basis by comparing our current forecasted collection rates to our initial expectations. We use a statistical model that considers a number of credit quality indicators to estimate the expected collection rate for each Consumer Loan at the time of assignment. The credit quality indicators considered in our model include attributes contained in the consumer’s credit bureau report, data contained in the consumer’s credit application, the structure of the proposed transaction, vehicle information, and other factors. We continue to evaluate the expected collection rate for each Consumer Loan subsequent to assignment primarily through the monitoring of consumer payment behavior. Our evaluation becomes more accurate as the Consumer Loans age, as we use actual performance data in our forecast.  Since all known, significant credit quality indicators have already been factored into our forecasts and pricing, we are not able to use any specific credit quality indicators to predict or explain variances in actual performance from our initial expectations. Any variances in performance from our initial expectations are a result of Consumer Loans performing differently from historical Consumer Loans with similar characteristics. We periodically adjust our statistical pricing model for new trends that we identify through our evaluation of these forecasted collection rate variances.
When overall forecasted collection rates underperform our initial expectations, the decline in forecasted collections has a more adverse impact on the profitability of the Purchased Loans than on the profitability of the Dealer Loans. For Purchased Loans, the decline in forecasted collections is absorbed entirely by us. For Dealer Loans, the decline in the forecasted collections is substantially offset by a decline in forecasted payments of Dealer Holdback.
Methodology Changes.
 During the second quarter of 2024, we applied an adjustment to our methodology for forecasting the amount of future net cash flows from our Loan portfolio, which reduced the forecasted collection rates for Consumer Loans assigned in 2022 through 2024. During the second quarter of 2023, we adjusted our methodology for forecasting the amount and timing of future net cash flows from our Loan portfolio through the utilization of more recent Consumer Loan performance and Consumer Loan prepayment data
. 
During the first quarter of 2022, we removed the COVID-19 forecast adjustment (as defined in Note 5) from our estimate of future net cash flows and enhanced our methodology for forecasting the amount and timing of future net cash flows from our Loan portfolio through the utilization of more recent data and new forecast variables. For additional information, see Note 5. For the three year period ended December 31, 2024, we did not make any other methodology changes for Loans that had a material impact on our financial statements.
Property and Equipment
Purchases of property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. Estimated useful lives are generally as follows: buildings – 
40
 years, building improvements – 
10
 years, data processing equipment – 
3
 years, software – 
5
 years, and office furniture and equipment – 
7
 years. The cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the balance sheet at the time of disposition and any resulting gain or loss is included in operations. Maintenance, repairs, and minor replacements are charged to operations as incurred; major replacements and improvements are capitalized. We evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
59
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (CONTINUED)
Costs incurred during the application development stage of software developed for internal use are capitalized and generally depreciated on a straight-line basis over 
five years
. Costs incurred to maintain existing software are expensed as incurred. For additional information regarding our property and equipment, see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred Debt Issuance Costs
Deferred debt issuance costs associated with secured financings and senior notes are included as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability, and deferred debt issuance costs associated with our revolving secured line of credit facility are included in other assets.  Expenses associated with the issuance of debt instruments are capitalized and amortized as interest expense over the term of the debt instrument using the effective interest method for asset-backed secured financings (“Term ABS financings”) and senior notes and the straight-line method for lines of credit and revolving secured warehouse (“Warehouse”) facilities. For additional information regarding deferred debt issuance costs, see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.
Finance Charges
Sources of Revenue.
 Finance charges is comprised of: (1) interest income earned on Loans; (2) administrative fees earned from ancillary products; (3) program fees charged to Dealers under the Portfolio Program; (4) Consumer Loan assignment fees charged to Dealers; and (5) direct origination costs incurred on Dealer Loans. 
We provide Dealers the ability to offer vehicle service contracts to consumers through our relationships with Third-Party Providers (“TPPs”). A vehicle service contract provides the consumer protection by paying for the repair or replacement of certain components of the vehicle in the event of a mechanical failure. The retail price of the vehicle service contract is included in the principal balance of the Consumer Loan. The wholesale cost of the vehicle service contract is paid to the TPP, net of an administrative fee retained by us. The difference between the wholesale cost and the retail price to the consumer is paid to the Dealer as a commission. Under the Portfolio Program, the wholesale cost of the vehicle service contract and the commission paid to the Dealer are charged to the Dealer’s advance balance. TPPs process claims on vehicle service contracts that are underwritten by third-party insurers. We bear the risk of loss for claims on certain vehicle service contracts that are reinsured by us. We market the vehicle service contracts directly to Dealers.
We provide Dealers the ability to offer Guaranteed Asset Protection (“GAP”) to consumers through our relationships with TPPs. GAP provides the consumer protection by paying the difference between the loan balance and the amount covered by the consumer’s insurance policy in the event of a total loss of the vehicle due to severe damage or theft. The retail price of GAP is included in the principal balance of the Consumer Loan. The wholesale cost of GAP is paid to the TPP, net of an administrative fee retained by us. The difference between the wholesale cost and the retail price to the consumer is paid to the Dealer as a commission. Under the Portfolio Program, the wholesale cost of GAP and the commission paid to the Dealer are charged to the Dealer’s advance balance. TPPs process claims on GAP contracts that are underwritten by third-party insurers.
Program fees represent monthly fees charged to Dealers for access to our Credit Approval Processing System (“CAPS”); administration, servicing, and collection services offered by us; documentation related to or affecting our program; and all tangible and intangible property owned by Credit Acceptance. We charge a monthly fee of $
599
 to Dealers participating in the Portfolio Program and we collect it from future Dealer Holdback payments. 
Recognition Policy.
 We recognize finance charges under the interest method such that revenue is recognized on a level-yield basis over the life of the Loan. We calculate finance charges on a monthly basis by applying the effective interest rate of the Loan to the net carrying amount of the Loan (Loan receivable less the related allowance for credit losses). The effective interest rate is based on contractual future net cash flows.
We report the change in the present value of credit losses attributable to the passage of time as a reduction to finance charges. Accordingly, we allocate finance charges recognized on each Loan between the Loan receivable and the related allowance for credit losses. The amount of finance charges allocated to the Loan receivable is equal to the effective interest rate applied to the Loans receivable balance. The reduction of finance charges allocated to the allowance for credit losses is equal to the effective interest rate applied to the allowance for credit losses balance.

Reinsurance
Our wholly owned subsidiary VSC Re is engaged in the business of reinsuring coverage under vehicle service contracts sold to consumers by Dealers on vehicles financed by us. VSC Re currently reinsures vehicle service contracts that are offered through one of our TPPs. Vehicle service contract premiums, which represent the selling price of the vehicle service contract to the consumer, less fees and certain administrative costs, are contributed to a trust account controlled by VSC Re. These premiums are used to fund claims covered under the vehicle service contracts. VSC Re is a bankruptcy remote entity. As such, our exposure to fund claims is limited to the trust assets controlled by VSC Re and our net investment in VSC Re.
Premiums from the reinsurance of vehicle service contracts are recognized over the life of the policy in proportion to expected costs of servicing those contracts. Expected costs are determined based on our historical claims experience. Claims are expensed through a provision for claims in the period the claim was incurred. Capitalized acquisition costs are comprised of premium taxes and are amortized as general and administrative expense over the life of the contracts in proportion to premiums earned.
We have consolidated the trust within our financial statements based on our determination of the following:
•
We have a variable interest in the trust.
 We have a residual interest in the assets of the trust, which is variable in nature, given that it increases or decreases based upon the actual loss experience of the related service contracts. In addition, VSC Re is required to absorb any losses in excess of the trust’s assets.
•
The trust is a variable interest entity.
 The trust has insufficient equity at risk as no parties to the trust were required to contribute assets that provide them with any ownership interest.
•
We are the primary beneficiary of the trust.
 We control the amount of premiums written and placed in the trust through Consumer Loan assignments under our Programs, which is the activity that most significantly impacts the economic performance of the trust. We have the right to receive benefits from the trust that could potentially be significant. In addition, VSC Re has the obligation to absorb losses of the trust that could potentially be significant.
Stock-Based Compensation Plans
We have stock-based compensation plans for team members and non-employee directors, which are described more fully in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. We apply a fair-value-based measurement method in accounting for stock-based compensation plans and recognize stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period of the grant as salaries and wages expense.
Employee Benefit Plan
We sponsor a 401(k) plan that covers substantially all of our team members. We offer matching contributions to the 401(k) plan based on each enrolled team member’s eligible annual gross pay (subject to statutory limitations). Our matching contribution rate is equal to 
100
% of the first 
4
% participants contribute and an additional 
50
% of the next 
2
% participants contribute, for a maximum matching contribution of 
5
% of each participant’s eligible annual gross pay. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized compensation expense of $
10.3
 million, $
9.4
 million, and $
8.5
 million, respectively, for our matching contributions to the plan.
Income Taxes
Provisions for federal, state, and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pre-tax earnings based on current tax law and also include, in the current period, the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes.
Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered.
61
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (CONTINUED)
We follow a two-step approach for recognizing uncertain tax positions. First, we evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. Second, for positions that we determine are more-likely-than-not to be sustained, we recognize the tax benefit as the largest benefit that has a greater than 
50
% likelihood of being sustained. We establish a reserve for uncertain tax positions liability that is comprised of unrecognized tax benefits and related interest. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in provision for income taxes. For additional information regarding our income taxes, see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were $
1.4
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, $
0.5
 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, and $
1.0
 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.
New Accounting Update Adopted During the Current Year
Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. 
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, which enhances the required disclosures for operating segments in annual and interim consolidated financial statements. The adoption of ASU 2023-07 for the year ended December 31, 2024 expanded our business segment disclosures, but did not otherwise have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
New Accounting Updates Not Yet Adopted
Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative. 
In October 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06
, 
which amends the disclosure or presentation requirements related to various subtopics in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (the “Codification”). The effective date for each amendment will be the date on which the SEC’s removal of that related disclosure from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes effective, with early adoption prohibited. If by June 30, 2027, the SEC has not removed the applicable requirement from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K, the pending content of the related amendment will be removed from the Codification and will not become effective for any entity. We are currently evaluating the 
impact the adoption of ASU 2023-06 
will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, which intends to improve the transparency of income tax disclosures by requiring (1) consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and (2) income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. It also includes certain other amendments intended to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted, but we have not yet adopted ASU 2023-09. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2023-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses.
 In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, which requires disaggregated disclosure of income statement expenses. ASU 2024-03 does not change the expense captions an entity presents on the face of the income statement; rather, it requires disaggregation of certain expense captions into specified categories in disclosures within the footnotes to the financial statements. ASU 2024-03 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2024-03 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

Subsequent Events
We have evaluated events and transactions occurring subsequent to the consolidated balance sheet date of December 31, 2024 for items that could potentially be recognized or disclosed in these financial statements. We did not identify any items which would require disclosure in or adjustment to the consolidated financial statements.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate their value.
Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents.  
The carrying amounts approximate their fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.
Restricted Securities Available for Sale.  
The fair value of U.S. Government and agency securities, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds is based on quoted market values in active markets.  For asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, and commercial paper we use model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market.
Loans Receivable, net.
  The fair value is determined by calculating the present value of expected future net cash flows estimated by us by utilizing the discount rate used to calculate the value of our Loans under our non-GAAP floating yield methodology.
Revolving Secured Lines of Credit.  
The fair value is determined by calculating the present value of the debt instrument based on current rates for debt with a similar risk profile and maturity.
Secured Financing.  
The fair value of certain Term ABS financings is determined using quoted market prices in an active market. For our warehouse facilities and certain other Term ABS financings, the fair values are determined by calculating the present value of each debt instrument based on current rates for debt with similar risk profiles and maturities.
Senior Notes.  
The fair value is determined using quoted market prices in an active market.
Mortgage Note. 
The fair value was determined by calculating the present value of the debt instrument based on current rates for debt with a similar risk profile and maturity.

Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. We group assets and liabilities at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. These levels are:
Level 1    Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets.
Level 2    Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market.
Level 3    Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect estimates or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
The following table provides the level of measurement used to determine the fair value for each of our financial instruments measured or disclosed at fair value:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (CONTINUED)
The net Loan income (finance charge revenue less provision for credit losses expense) that we recognize over the life of a Loan equals the cash we collect from the underlying Consumer Loan less the cash we pay to the Dealer. Under CECL, we are required to recognize:
•
a significant provision for credit losses expense at the time of assignment for contractual net cash flows we do not expect to realize; and
•
finance charge revenue in subsequent periods that is significantly in excess of our expected yields.

Credit Quality
We monitor and evaluate the credit quality of Consumer Loans assigned under our Portfolio and Purchase Programs on a monthly basis by comparing our current forecasted collection rates to our prior forecasted collection rates and our initial expectations. For additional information regarding credit quality, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. 
The following table compares our aggregated forecast of Consumer Loan collection rates as of December 31, 2024, with the aggregated forecasts as of December 31, 2023, as of December 31, 2022, and at the time of assignment, segmented by year of assignment:

Represents the total forecasted collections we expect to collect on the Consumer Loans as a percentage of the repayments that we were contractually owed on the Consumer Loans at the time of assignment.  Contractual repayments include both principal and interest. Forecasted collection rates are negatively impacted by canceled Consumer Loans as the contractual amount owed is not removed from the denominator for purposes of computing forecasted collection rates in the table.
(2)
The forecasted collection rates presented for Dealer Loans and Purchased Loans reflect the Consumer Loan classification at the time of assignment.

We evaluate and adjust the expected collection rate for each Consumer Loan subsequent to assignment primarily through the monitoring of consumer payment behavior.

During the second quarter of 2024, we applied an adjustment to our methodology for forecasting the amount of future net cash flows from our Loan portfolio, which reduced the forecasted collection rates for Consumer Loans assigned in 2022 through 2024. Consumer Loans assigned in 2022 had continued to underperform our expectations for several quarters. Consumer Loans assigned in 2023 had also begun exhibiting similar trends of underperformance, although not as severe as Consumer Loans assigned in 2022. During the second quarter of 2024, we determined that we had sufficient Consumer Loan performance experience to estimate the magnitude by which we expected Consumer Loans assigned in 2022 through 2024 would likely underperform our historical collection rates on Consumer Loans with similar characteristics. Accordingly, we applied an adjustment to Consumer Loans assigned in 2022 through 2024 to reduce forecasted collection rates to what we believed the ultimate collection rates would be based on these trends. Changes in the amount and timing of forecasted net cash flows are recognized in the period of change as a provision for credit losses. The implementation of this forecast adjustment during the second quarter of 2024 reduced forecasted net cash flows by $
147.2
 million, or 
1.4
%, and increased provision for credit losses by $
127.5
 million.
During the second quarter of 2023, we adjusted our methodology for forecasting the amount and timing of future net cash flows from our Loan portfolio through the utilization of more recent Consumer Loan performance and Consumer Loan prepayment data. We had experienced a decrease in Consumer Loan prepayments to below-average levels and, as a result, slowed our forecasted net cash flow timing. Historically, Consumer Loan prepayments have been lower in periods with less availability of consumer credit. Changes in the amount and timing of forecasted net cash flows are recognized in the period of change as a provision for credit losses. The implementation of the adjustment to our forecasting methodology during the second quarter of 2023 reduced forecasted net cash flows by $
44.5
 million, or 
0.5
%, and increased provision for credit losses by $
71.3
 million.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (CONTINUED)
The COVID-19 pandemic created conditions that increased the level of uncertainty associated with our estimate of the amount and timing of future net cash flows from our Loan portfolio. During the first quarter of 2020, we applied a subjective adjustment to our forecasting model to reflect our best estimate of the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future net cash flows (“COVID forecast adjustment”), which reduced our estimate of future net cash flows by $162.2 million. We continued to apply the COVID forecast adjustment through the end of 2021, as it continued to represent our best estimate. During the first quarter of 2022, we determined that we had sufficient Consumer Loan performance experience since the lapse of federal stimulus payments and enhanced unemployment benefits to refine our estimate of future net cash flows. Accordingly, during the first quarter of 2022, we removed the COVID forecast adjustment and enhanced our methodology for forecasting the amount and timing of future net cash flows from our Loan portfolio through the utilization of more recent data and new forecast variables. 
The removal of the COVID forecast adjustment and the implementation of the enhanced forecasting methodology during the first quarter of 2022 impacted forecasted net cash flows and provision for credit losses as follows:

As the vast majority of our team members now work remotely, we had significant excess space in the two office buildings that we owned in Southfield, Michigan. During the second quarter of 2024, we sold the larger building for net sales proceeds of $
3.2
 million and recognized a loss on sale of the building of $
23.7
 million. The loss on sale of the building represented the amount by which the $

Ancillary product profit sharing consists of payments received from TPPs based upon the performance of vehicle service contracts and GAP contracts, and is recognized as income over the life of the vehicle service contracts and GAP contracts.
Interest consists of income earned on cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, and restricted securities available for sale. Interest income is generally recognized over time as it is earned. Interest income on restricted securities available for sale is recognized over the life of the underlying financial instruments using the interest method.
Remarketing fees consist of fees charged to Dealers that are retained from the sale of repossessed vehicles by Vehicle Remarketing Services, Inc. (“VRS”), our wholly owned subsidiary that is responsible for remarketing vehicles for Credit Acceptance. VRS coordinates vehicle repossessions with a nationwide network of repossession contractors, the redemption of the vehicles by the consumers, and the sale of the vehicles through a nationwide network of vehicle auctions. VRS recognizes income from the retained fees at the time of the sale and does not retain a fee if a repossessed vehicle is redeemed by the consumer prior to the sale.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (CONTINUED)
Revolving Secured Lines of Credit
We have two revolving secured lines of credit: (1) a $
390.0
 million revolving secured line of credit facility, to which we refer as our revolving secured line of credit facility, with a commercial bank syndicate and (2) an uncommitted $20.0 million revolving secured line of credit facility, to which we refer as the RTP facility, with a lender for use solely in facilitating payments by the Company through the lender’s real-time payments service.
Borrowings under our revolving secured line of credit facility, including any letters of credit issued under the facility, are subject to a borrowing-base limitation. This limitation equals 
80
% of the Dealer Loans Receivable constituting revolving credit facility collateral and 80% of Purchased Contract Balances constituting revolving credit facility collateral (each as defined in the agreement governing our revolving secured line of credit facility), less a hedging reserve (not exceeding $
1.0
 million), and less the amount of other outstanding debt secured by the collateral that secures our revolving secured line of credit facility. Borrowings under our revolving secured line of credit facility are secured by a lien on most of our assets that do not secure obligations under our Warehouse facilities or Term ABS financings.
Borrowings under the RTP facility are secured by a lien on the same collateral that secures obligations under our revolving secured line of credit facility. The RTP facility terminates automatically if the lender ceases to be part of the commercial bank syndicate under our revolving secured line of credit facility or if its lending commitments under our revolving secured line of credit facility are terminated.
Warehouse Facilities
We have 
five
 Warehouse facilities with total borrowing capacity of $
1,325.0
 million. Each of the facilities is with a different lender or group of lenders. Under each Warehouse facility, we can convey Loans to the applicable wholly owned subsidiary in return for cash and/or an increase in the value of our equity in such subsidiary. In turn, each such subsidiary pledges the Loans as collateral to secure financing that will fund the cash portion of the purchase price of the Loans. The financing provided to each such subsidiary under the applicable facility is generally limited to the lesser of 
80
% of the outstanding balance of the conveyed Loans, as determined in accordance with the applicable agreement, plus certain restricted cash and cash equivalents pledged as collateral, or the facility limit.
The financings create indebtedness for which the subsidiaries are liable and which is secured by all the assets of each subsidiary. Such indebtedness is non-recourse to us (other than customary, limited recourse to us in the form of repurchase obligations or indemnification obligations for any violations by us of our representations or obligations as seller, servicer, or custodian), even though we are consolidated for financial reporting purposes with the subsidiaries. Because the subsidiaries are organized as bankruptcy-remote legal entities separate from us, their assets (including the conveyed Loans) are not available to any creditors other than the creditors of the applicable subsidiary.
The subsidiaries pay us a monthly servicing fee equal to either 
4
% or 
6
%, depending upon the facility, of the collections received with respect to the conveyed Loans. The servicing fee is paid out of the collections. Except for the servicing fee and holdback payments due to Dealers, if a facility is amortizing, we do not have any rights in any portion of such collections until all outstanding principal, accrued and unpaid interest, fees, and other related costs have been paid in full. If a facility is in its revolving period, the applicable subsidiary is entitled to the portion of such collections available after the payment of interest and transaction expenses under the facility, provided that the borrowing base requirements of the facility are satisfied.
Term ABS Financings
We have wholly owned subsidiaries (the “Funding LLCs”) that have completed secured financing transactions with qualified institutional investors or lenders. In connection with each of these transactions, we conveyed Loans on an arms-length basis to a Funding LLC for cash and the sole membership interest in that Funding LLC. In turn, each Funding LLC, other than the Funding LLCs for the Term ABS 2019-2, 2021-1, 2022-2, 2023-A, and 2024-B financings, conveyed the Loans to the respective trusts that issued notes to qualified institutional investors. The Funding LLCs for the Term ABS 2019-2, 2021-1, 2022-2, 2023-A, and 2024-B financings pledged the Loans for the benefit of their respective lenders. The Term ABS 2021-4, 2023-1, 2023-2, 2023-3, 2023-A, 2023-5, 2024-A, 2024-1, 2024-2, and 2024-3 financings each consist of three classes of notes (or, in the case of the Term ABS 2023-A and Term ABS 2024-B, three classes of loans), while the Term ABS 2022-1 and Term ABS 2022-3 financings consist of four classes of notes. 
84
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (CONTINUED)
Each Term ABS financing at the time of issuance has a specified revolving period during which we are likely to convey additional Loans to the applicable Funding LLC. Each Funding LLC (other than the Funding LLCs of the Term ABS 2019-2, 2021-1, 2022-2, 2023-A, and 2024-B financings) will then convey the Loans to its respective trust. At the end of the applicable revolving period, the debt outstanding under each financing will begin to amortize.
The Term ABS financings create indebtedness for which the applicable trust or Funding LLC is liable and which is secured by all the assets of the applicable trust or Funding LLC. Such indebtedness is non-recourse to us (other than customary, limited recourse to us in the form of repurchase obligations or indemnification obligations for any violations by us of our representations or obligations as seller, servicer, or custodian)
,
 even though we are consolidated for financial reporting purposes with the trusts and the Funding LLCs. Because the trusts and the Funding LLCs are organized as bankruptcy-remote legal entities separate from us, their assets (including the conveyed Loans) are not available to any creditors other than the creditors of the applicable subsidiary. We receive a monthly servicing fee on each financing equal to 
4
% of the collections received with respect to the conveyed Loans. The fee is paid out of the collections. Except for the servicing fee and Dealer Holdback payments due to Dealers, if a Term ABS financing is amortizing, we do not have any rights in any portion of such collections until all outstanding principal, accrued and unpaid interest, fees, and other related costs have been paid in full. If a Term ABS financing is in its revolving period, the applicable trust or Funding LLC is entitled to the portion of such collections available after application of any amounts necessary to acquire additional Loans from us and to pay accrued interest on the debt and any other transaction expenses, provided that any necessary principal payments are made to compensate for certain reductions in the balance of eligible loans or, in the case of the Term ABS 2019-2 financing and Term ABS financings occurring after the Term ABS 2021-3 financing, certain reductions in forecasted collections. In addition, in our capacity as servicer of the Loans, we have a limited right to exercise a “clean-up call” option to purchase Loans from the Funding LLCs and/or the trusts under certain specified circumstances. For those Funding LLCs with a trust, when the trust’s indebtedness is paid in full, either through collections or through a prepayment of the indebtedness, the trust is to pay any remaining collections over to its Funding LLC as the sole beneficiary of the trust. For all Funding LLCs, after the indebtedness is paid in full, any remaining collections will ultimately be available to be distributed to us as the sole member of the respective Funding LLC.
Senior Notes
On December 19, 2023, we issued $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9.250% senior notes due 2028 (the “2028 senior notes”). The 2028 senior notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of December 19, 2023, among the Company, as issuer, the Company’s subsidiaries Buyers Vehicle Protection Plan, Inc. and Vehicle Remarketing Services, Inc., as guarantors (collectively, the “Guarantors”), and the trustee under the indenture.
The 2028 senior notes mature on December 15, 2028 and bear interest at a rate of 9.250% per annum, computed on the basis of a 360-day year composed of twelve 30-day months and payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on June 15, 2024. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the 2028 senior notes to repurchase or redeem all of the $400.0 million outstanding principal amount of our 5.125% senior notes due 2024 (the “2024 senior notes”), of which $322.3 million was repurchased on December 19, 2023 and the remaining $77.7 million was redeemed on December 31, 2023. We used the remaining net proceeds from the 2028 senior notes for general corporate purposes. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we recognized a pre-tax loss on extinguishment of debt of $1.8 million related to the repurchase and redemption of the 2024 senior notes. 
On March 7, 2019, we issued $
400.0
 million aggregate principal amount of 
6.625
% senior notes due 2026 (the “2026 senior notes”). The 2026 senior notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of March 7, 2019, among the Company, as issuer, the Guarantors and the trustee under the indenture. 
The 2026 senior notes mature on March 15, 2026 and bear interest at a rate of 
6.625
% per annum, computed on the basis of a 360-day year composed of twelve 30-day months and payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2019. We used the net proceeds from the offering of the 2026 senior notes for general corporate purposes, including repayment of outstanding borrowings under our revolving secured line of credit facility.
The 2028 senior notes and 2026 senior notes (the “senior notes”) are guaranteed on a senior basis by the Guarantors, which are also guarantors of obligations under our revolving secured line of credit facility. Other existing and future subsidiaries of ours may become guarantors of the senior notes in the future. The indentures for the senior notes provide for a guarantor of the senior notes to be released from its obligations under its guarantee of the senior notes under specified circumstances.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (CONTINUED)
Mortgage Note
We had a mortgage note with a commercial bank that was secured by a first mortgage lien on a building acquired by us and an assignment of all leases, rents, revenues, and profits under all present and future leases of the building. The note was paid off in full during the second quarter of 2024 in connection with the sale of the related building.

The principal maturities of the Term ABS financings are estimated based on forecasted collections.
Debt Covenants
As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with our covenants under our revolving secured line of credit facility, our Warehouse facilities, our Term ABS financings, the senior notes indentures, and the RTP Facility.
Our revolving secured line of credit facility and our Warehouse facilities include covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios and other financial conditions. These covenants require a minimum ratio of (1) our net earnings, adjusted for specified items, before income taxes, depreciation, amortization, and fixed charges to (2) our fixed charges, as defined in the agreements. These covenants also limit the maximum ratio of our funded debt less unrestricted cash and cash equivalents to tangible net worth. Some of these covenants may indirectly limit the repurchase of common stock or payment of dividends on common stock. Our Warehouse facilities and Term ABS financings contain covenants that measure the performance of the conveyed assets.

State and local income taxes
For the year ended December 31, 2024, the impact of state and local income taxes on our effective income tax rate increased from 2023, primarily due to an adjustment to an uncertain tax position estimate for state income taxes during the second quarter of 2024 and changes in state tax laws that were enacted during the second quarter of 2024.
For the year ended December 31, 2023, the impact of state and local income taxes on our effective income tax rate decreased from 2022 primarily due to the settlement of an uncertain tax position for state income taxes during the second quarter of 2023.
Non-deductible executive compensation expense
We recognize non-deductible executive compensation expense as an increase of provision for income taxes or a reduction of benefit for income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the impact of non-deductible executive compensation expense on our effective income tax rate increased from 2023, primarily due to an increase in non-deductible executive compensation expense. 
Excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation
We recognize an excess tax benefit or tax deficiency when the deduction for the stock-based compensation expense of a stock award for tax purposes differs from the cumulative stock-based compensation expense recognized in the financial statements. The excess tax benefit or tax deficiency is recognized in provision for income taxes in the period in which the amount of the deduction is determined, which is when restricted stock vests, restricted stock units are settled in common stock, or stock options are exercised. Excess tax benefits reduce our effective income tax rate, while tax deficiencies increase our effective income tax rate. The decrease in the impact of excess tax benefits on our effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to 2023 was primarily due to a decrease in the number of restricted stock units that were settled in common stock during 2024 due to the timing of long-term stock award grants.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS
Pursuant to our Amended and Restated Incentive Compensation Plan (the “Incentive Plan”), at any time prior to April 12, 2031, we can grant stock-based awards in the form of restricted stock, restricted stock units, and stock options to team members, officers, directors, and contractors. On April 10, 2024, our board of directors approved an amendment to the Incentive Plan, subject to shareholder approval, increasing the number of shares authorized for issuance by 
250,000
 shares, to 
3,250,000
 shares. Shareholder approval was received at our annual meeting of shareholders on June 5, 2024. The shares available for future grants under the Incentive Plan totaled 
310,552
 as of December 31, 2024.
Restricted Stock Units
We grant performance-based and time-based restricted stock units to team members and directors in accordance with the Incentive Plan. The grant-date fair value per share is estimated to equal the market price of our common stock on the date of grant. Each restricted stock unit represents and has a value equal to one share of common stock. Based on the terms of individual restricted stock unit grant agreements, restricted stock units vest under one of the following methods:
•
For executive officers and senior leaders, over a period of 
ten years
, based on continuous employment. 
•
For certain team members, over a period of three or 
four years
, based on continuous employment.
•
For independent directors, over a period of 
three years
, based on continuous service as a director.

Instead of a short-term compensation program providing for rolling, annual equity awards to our executive officers and senior leaders, we utilize a multi-year compensation program that grants a one-time equity award at the beginning of the compensation program period that is intended to incentivize recipients over the multi-year compensation period. Our current compensation program for executive officers and senior leaders covers the 2025 through 2034 compensation period and included a one-time equity award in December 2024 with a vesting period of ten years.

BUSINESS SEGMENT AND OTHER INFORMATION
Business Segment Overview
We identify operating segments as components of our business for which separate financial information is regularly evaluated by our Chief Executive Officer, who acts as the chief operating decision-maker (“CODM”), in assessing performance and making decisions regarding resource allocation. We periodically review and redefine our segment reporting as internal management reporting practices evolve and the components of our business change. Currently, the CODM reviews consolidated financial statements and metrics to assess performance and allocate resources. Thus, we have determined that we operate in 
one
 reportable operating segment that represents our core business of offering Dealers innovative financing solutions and related products and services that enable them to sell vehicles to consumers, regardless of their credit history. 
The consolidated financial statements reflect the financial results of our 
one
 reportable operating segment. The accounting policies of this segment are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 2. The CODM assesses performance for our one reportable operating segment and decides how to allocate resources based on net income, as reported on our consolidated statements of income, and total assets, as reported on our consolidated balance sheets.
Geographic Information
For the three years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, all of our revenues were derived from the United States.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, all of our long-lived assets were located in the United States.
Products and Services Information
Our primary product consists of innovative financing solutions that enable Dealers to sell vehicles to consumers, regardless of their credit history. We also provide Dealers the ability to offer ancillary products on vehicles financed by us.
Major Customer Information
We did not have any Dealers that provided 10% or more of our revenue during 2024, 2023, or 2022. Additionally, no single Dealer’s Loans receivable balance accounted for more than 10% of total Loans receivable as of December 31, 2024 or 2023.
15.    
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Litigation and Other Legal Matters
In the normal course of business and as a result of the consumer-oriented nature of the industry in which we operate, we and other industry participants are frequently subject to various consumer claims, litigation, and regulatory investigations seeking damages, fines, and statutory penalties. The claims allege, among other theories of liability, violations of state, federal, and foreign truth-in-lending, credit availability, credit reporting, consumer protection, warranty, debt collection, insurance, and other consumer-oriented laws and regulations, including claims seeking damages for alleged physical and mental harm relating to the repossession and sale of consumers’ vehicles and other debt collection activities. As the assignee of Consumer Loans originated by Dealers, we may also be named as a co-defendant in lawsuits filed by consumers principally against Dealers. We may also have disputes and litigation with Dealers. The claims may allege, among other theories of liability, that we breached the Dealer servicing agreement. We may also have disputes and litigation with vendors and other third parties. The claims may allege, among other theories of liability, that we breached a license agreement or contract. The damages, fines, and penalties that may be claimed by consumers, regulatory agencies, Dealers, vendors, or other third parties in these types of matters can be substantial. The relief requested by plaintiffs varies but may include requests for compensatory, statutory, and punitive damages and injunctive relief, and plaintiffs may seek treatment as purported class actions or they may file individual arbitration demands for which arbitration providers may request separate filing fees. Current actions to which we are a party include the following matters: 
On December 1, 2021, we received a subpoena from the Office of the Attorney General for the State of California seeking documents and information regarding GAP products, GAP product administration, and refunds. We have cooperated with this inquiry and cannot predict the eventual scope, duration, or outcome at this time. As a result, we are unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of reasonably possible loss arising from this investigation.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (CONTINUED)
On May 7, 2019, we received a subpoena from the Consumer Frauds and Protection Bureau of the Office of the New York State Attorney General, relating to the Company’s origination and collection policies and procedures in the state of New York. After May 7, 2019 through April 30, 2021, we received additional subpoenas from the Office of the New York State Attorney General relating to the Company's origination, collection, and securitization practices. On November 19, 2020 and August 23, 2022, we received letters from the Office of the New York State Attorney General indicating that it may commence litigation against the Company asserting violations of New York Executive Law § 63(12) and New York General Business Law §§ 349 and 352 et seq. and applicable federal laws, including but not limited to claims that the Company engaged in unfair and deceptive trade practices in auto lending, debt collection, and asset-backed securitizations in the State of New York in violation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, New York Executive Law § 63(12), the New York Martin Act, and New York General Business Law § 349. See the description below of the lawsuit commenced by the Office of the New York State Attorney General on January 4, 2023.
On April 22, 2019, we received a civil investigative demand from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“Bureau”) seeking, among other things, certain information relating to the Company’s origination and collection of Consumer Loans, TPPs, and credit reporting. After April 22, 2019 through March 7, 2022, we received additional subpoenas from the Bureau. On December 6, 2021, we received a Notice and Opportunity to Respond and Advise letter from the Staff of the Office of Enforcement (“Staff”) of the Bureau, stating that the Staff was considering whether to recommend that the Bureau take legal action against the Company for alleged violations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (the “CFPA”) in connection with the Company’s consumer loan origination practices. See the description below of the lawsuit commenced by the Bureau on January 4, 2023. 
On January 4, 2023, the Office of the New York State Attorney General and the Bureau jointly filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that the Company engaged in deceptive practices, fraud, illegality, and securities fraud in violation of New York Executive Law § 63(12) and New York General Business Law §§ 349 and 352, and that the Company engaged in deceptive and abusive acts and provided substantial assistance to a covered person or service provider in violation of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. § 5531 and 12 U.S.C. § 5536(a)(1)(B). The complaint seeks injunctive relief, an accounting of all consumers for whom the Company provided financing, restitution, damages, disgorgement, civil penalties, and payment of costs. On March 14, 2023, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. On August 7, 2023, the court stayed the action pending the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in 
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau v. Community Financial Services Association of America, Ltd., 
No. 22-448 (“CFSA”).

On July 1, 2024, the court lifted the stay in view of the decision in CFSA and requested revised briefing on the Company’s motion to dismiss that would address the intervening legal developments and sharpen the issues for resolution. As of October 29, 2024, the Company's motion to dismiss has been fully briefed. We are unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of reasonably possible loss arising from this litigation. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself in this matter.
On March 18, 2016, we received a subpoena from the Attorney General of the State of Maryland, relating to the Company’s repossession and sale policies and procedures in the state of Maryland. On April 3, 2020, we received a subpoena from the Attorney General of the State of Maryland relating to the Company’s origination and collection policies and procedures in the state of Maryland. On August 11, 2020, we received a subpoena from the Attorney General of the State of Maryland restating most of the requests contained in the March 18, 2016 and April 3, 2020 subpoenas, making additional requests, and expanding the inquiry to include 41 other states (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin) and the District of Columbia. Also on August 11, 2020, we received from the Attorney General of the State of New Jersey a subpoena that is essentially identical to the August 11, 2020 Maryland subpoena, both as to substance and as to the jurisdictions identified. The Company has been informed that the State of Kansas, the State of Texas, and the State of Iowa have withdrawn from the multistate investigation. We are cooperating with these investigations and cannot predict their eventual scope, duration, or outcome at this time. As a result, we are unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of reasonably possible loss arising from these investigations.
An adverse ultimate disposition in any action to which we are a party or otherwise subject could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, liquidity, and results of operations.

On October 2, 2020, a shareholder filed a putative class action complaint against the Company, its Chief Executive Officer (now former Chief Executive Officer), and its Chief Financial Officer (now Chief Executive Officer) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division, alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, promulgated thereunder, based on alleged false and/or misleading statements or omissions regarding the Company and its business, and seeking class certification, unspecified damages plus interest and attorney and expert witness fees, and other costs on behalf of a purported class consisting of all persons and entities (subject to specified exceptions) that purchased or otherwise acquired Credit Acceptance common stock from November 1, 2019 through August 28, 2020. In 2022, the Company reached an agreement to make an aggregate cash payment of $
12.0
 million, all of which was recognized during the second quarter of 2022, to settle claims brought on behalf of all persons and entities that purchased or otherwise acquired Credit Acceptance common stock from May 4, 2018 through August 28, 2020, and provided for a full release of all claims against all defendants, including the Company and its officers. On December 16, 2022, the court entered a final order and judgment consistent with the settlement agreement, including dismissal with prejudice of all claims asserted against the Company and its officers.

ITEM 9.    CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
Not applicable.
ITEM 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.
(a) 
Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 
Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in recording, processing, summarizing, and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act and are effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
(b) 
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. 
There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
•
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;
•
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and
•
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our assessment, we believe that as of December 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
Our independent registered public accounting firm, Grant Thornton LLP, audited our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, and their attestation report dated February 12, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on our internal control over financial reporting and is included in this Item 9A.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Board of Directors and Shareholders
Credit Acceptance Corporation
Opinion on internal control over financial reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Credit Acceptance Corporation (a Michigan corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by COSO.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, and our report dated February 12, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
