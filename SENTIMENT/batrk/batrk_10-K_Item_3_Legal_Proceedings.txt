Item 7. M
anagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis provides information concerning our results of operations and financial condition. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.
Explanatory Note
On July 18, 2023, Liberty Media Corporation (“Liberty” or “Liberty Media”), the then current parent organization of Atlanta Braves Holdings, Inc. (“Atlanta Braves Holdings,” “the Company,” “us,” “we,” or “our”) completed the previously announced redemption of each outstanding share of its Liberty Braves common stock in exchange for one share of the corresponding series of common stock of the Company (the “Split-Off”). 
The Split-Off was 
intended to be tax-free to holders of Liberty Braves common stock and in September 2024, the Internal Revenue Service completed its review of the Split-Off and notified Liberty that it agreed with the non-taxable characterization of the transaction. In September 2024, the then-current officers of the Company (with limited exceptions) stepped down from their officer positions and members of its wholly-owned subsidiary Braves Holdings, LLC (“Braves Holdings”) assumed these roles (the “Corporate Governance Transition”). The Company is comprised of the businesses, assets and liabilities of Braves Holdings and corporate cash. 
The intergroup interests in the Liberty Braves Group held by subsidiaries of Liberty prior to the Split-Off were settled through attribution of Atlanta Braves Holdings Series C common stock and subsequently sold in the secondary market. Atlanta Braves Holdings did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of our common stock by these subsidiaries of Liberty. Following this transaction, neither Liberty nor Atlanta Braves Holdings has any continuing stock ownership, beneficial or otherwise, in the other. 
Overview
The Company manages its business based on the following reportable segments: Baseball and Mixed-Use Development.
The Baseball segment includes operations relating to the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball Club (“ANLBC,” the “Atlanta Braves,” the “Braves,” the “club,” or the “team”) and the Braves’ ballpark (“Truist Park” or the “Stadium”) and includes revenue generated from ticket sales, concessions, local broadcasting rights, advertising sponsorships, suites and premium seat fees, retail and licensing revenue, shared Major League Baseball (“MLB”) revenue streams, including national broadcasting rights and licensing, and other sources. Ticket sales, concessions, broadcasting rights and advertising sponsorship sales are the Baseball segment’s primary revenue drivers.
The Mixed-Use Development segment includes retail, office, hotel and entertainment operations primarily within The Battery Atlanta (the “Mixed-Use Development”). The Mixed-Use Development segment derives revenue primarily from office and retail rental income (including overage rent and tenant reimbursements) and, to a lesser extent, parking and advertising sponsorships throughout the year.
Strategies and Challenges
Executive Summary
The financial results of Atlanta Braves Holdings depend in large part on the ability of the Braves to achieve on-field success. The team’s successes generate significant fan enthusiasm, resulting in sustained ticket, premium seating, concession and merchandise sales, and greater shares of local broadcasting audiences. Management focuses on making operational and business decisions that enhance the on-field performance of the Braves and this may sometimes require implementing strategies and making investments that may negatively impact short-term profitability for the sake of immediate on-field success. 
II-2

Table of Contents
Braves Holdings, affiliated entities and third-party development partners, developed a significant portion of the land around Truist Park, the Braves’ stadium, creating a 2.25 million square-foot mixed-use complex that features retail, residential, office, hotel and entertainment opportunities, known as The Battery Atlanta. We believe that the continued development and operations of The Battery Atlanta will result in increased game attendance as well as office and retail rental income (including overage rent and tenant reimbursements), and income from parking and corporate sponsorships throughout the year. 
Key Drivers of Revenue
Atlanta Braves Holdings manages its business based on the following reportable segments: Baseball and Mixed-Use Development. The Baseball segment includes its operations relating to the Braves baseball franchise and Truist Park and includes revenue generated from game attendance (ticket sales), concessions, local broadcasting rights, advertising sponsorships, suites and premium seat fees, retail and licensing revenue, shared MLB revenue streams, including national broadcasting rights and licensing, and other sources. 
The Mixed-Use Development segment includes retail, office, hotel and entertainment operations primarily within The Battery Atlanta. The Battery Atlanta derives revenue primarily from office and retail rental income (including overage rent and tenant reimbursements) and, to a lesser extent, parking and advertising sponsorships throughout the year. 
Current Trends Affecting Our Business
The ability of Atlanta Braves Holdings to increase or maintain revenue and earnings could be adversely affected to the extent that relevant economic environments decline. Future performance is dependent in part on general economic conditions and the effect of those conditions on our customers. Weak economic conditions may lead to lower ticket demand for baseball events, which would also negatively affect concession and merchandise sales, and lower levels of advertising sponsorships. While Atlanta Braves Holdings is currently unable to predict the extent of any of these potential adverse effects as of December 31, 2024, Atlanta Braves Holdings does not believe that its operations have been materially impacted by recent inflationary pressures.

​
Baseball revenue increased $13.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year, due to new sponsorship agreements and contractual rate increases on season tickets and existing sponsorship contracts, partially offset by reduced attendance at regular season home games and a reduction in ticket sales and concession revenue due to fewer postseason games in 2024. Broadcasting revenue increased $5.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to contractual rate increases. Retail and licensing revenue decreased $3.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year, due to a reduction in local revenue due to the decrease in regular season home game attendance and demand for City Connect and other apparel, partially offset by higher league-wide revenue. Other revenue, a component of baseball revenue, increased $3.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in spring training related revenue (ticket sales, concession revenue and other gameday related revenue), driven by increased attendance at spring training home games. 
Mixed-Use Development revenue.

Mixed-Use Development revenue is derived from the mixed-use facilities and primarily includes rental income and to a lesser extent, parking revenue and sponsorships. For the year ended December 31, 2024, Mixed-Use Development revenue increased $8.3 million, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $5.0 million 
increase in rental income and a $3.0 million increase in parking revenue. Increases in rental income for the year ended December 31, 2024, were primarily driven by $3.2 million in various new lease commencements and a $2.2 million increase in tenant recoveries, partially offset by a reduction in overage rent.
Baseball operating costs.
 Baseball operating costs primarily include costs associated with baseball and stadium operations. For the year ended December 31, 2024, baseball operating expenses increased $21.8 million, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $16.7 million increase under MLB’s revenue sharing plan and other shared expenses, a $6.3 million increase in minor league team and player expenses, and a $3.2 million increase in major league player salaries, partially offset by $3.0 million decrease in variable concession and retail operating expenses, due to reduced attendance at regular season home games during 2024. 
Mixed-Use Development costs.

Mixed-Use Development costs

primarily include costs associated with maintaining and operating the mixed-use facilities. During the year ended December 31, 2024, Mixed-Use Development costs increased $0.9 million, as compared to the prior year, due to security and parking expenses and other various operating increases. 
Selling, general and administrative, excluding stock-based compensation.

Selling, general and administrative expense includes costs of marketing, advertising, finance and related personnel costs. Selling, general and administrative expense decreased $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to reduced transaction costs related to the Split-Off, partially offset by increased personnel costs as well as insurance, information technology and professional fees.
Stock-based compensation.
 For the year ended year ended December 31, 2024, stock-based compensation increased $3.3 million as compared to the prior year, mainly due to accelerated vesting for various awards in connection with the Corporate Governance Transition. 
Depreciation and amortization.
 Depreciation and amortization decreased $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to various assets becoming fully depreciated.

Operating income (loss).

Operating loss decreased $6.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year, due to the above explanations.
Non-GAAP Adjusted OIBDA.
 To provide investors with additional information regarding the Company’s financial results, we also disclose Adjusted OIBDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted OIBDA as operating income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, separately reported litigation settlements, restructuring, acquisition and impairment charges. 
Our chief operating decision maker and management team use this measure of performance in conjunction with other measures to evaluate our businesses and make decisions about allocating resources among our businesses.
 We believe this is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of our businesses by identifying those items that are not directly a reflection of each business’ performance or indicative of ongoing business trends. In addition, this measure allows us to view operating results, perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. Adjusted OIBDA should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, operating income (loss), net earnings (loss), cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The following table provides a reconciliation of Operating income (loss) to Adjusted OIBDA:

Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on intergroup interests, net.
 As the notional shares underlying the intergroup interests were not represented by outstanding shares of common stock, such shares had not been officially designated Series A, B or C Liberty Braves common stock. However, Liberty historically assumed that the notional shares (if and when issued) related to the Formula One Group interest in the Braves Group would be comprised of Series C Liberty Braves common stock and the notional shares (if and when issued) related to the Liberty SiriusXM Group interest in the Braves Group would be comprised of Series A Liberty Braves common stock. Therefore, the market prices of Series C Liberty Braves and Series A Liberty Braves common stock were used for the mark-to-market adjustment for the intergroup interests held by Formula One Group and Liberty SiriusXM Group, respectively, through the consolidated statements of operations. During the second quarter of 2023, Liberty determined that, in connection with the Split-Off, shares of Atlanta Braves Holdings Series C common stock would be used to settle and extinguish the intergroup interest in the Braves Group attributed to the Liberty SiriusXM Group. Accordingly, effective as of June 30, 2023 and through the Split-Off date, the market price of Series C Liberty Braves common stock was used for the mark-to-market adjustment for the intergroup interest held by the Liberty SiriusXM Group. Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on intergroup interests, net were driven by changes in the market prices of Liberty Braves common stock. As disclosed above, the intergroup interests were settled and extinguished in connection with the Split-Off.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $110.1 million of cash and cash equivalents. Substantially all of its cash and cash equivalents are invested in U.S. Treasury securities, other government securities or government guaranteed funds, AAA rated money market funds and other highly rated financial and corporate debt instruments.
During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s primary uses of cash were capital expenditures, working capital requirements and debt service, funded primarily by cash from operations, distributions from equity method affiliates and new borrowings on construction loans.
The Company’s uses of cash are expected to be payments to certain players, coaches and executives pursuant to long-term employment agreements, capital expenditures, investments in real estate ventures and debt service payments. The Company expects to fund its projected uses of cash with cash on hand, cash provided by operations and through borrowings under construction loans and revolvers. We believe that the available sources of liquidity are sufficient to cover our projected future uses of cash.
Sources of Liquidity
The following are potential sources of liquidity: available cash balances, cash generated by Braves Holdings’ operating activities (to the extent such cash exceeds Braves Holdings’ working capital needs and is not otherwise restricted), net proceeds from asset sales, debt borrowings under the LWCF, the MLBFF and the TeamCo Revolver (each as defined below) and dividend and interest receipts.
League Wide Credit Facility
In December 2013, a subsidiary of Braves Holdings executed various agreements to enter into MLB’s League Wide Credit Facility (the “LWCF”). Pursuant to the terms of a revolving credit agreement, Major League Baseball Trust may borrow from certain lenders, with Bank of America, N.A. acting as the administrative agent. Major League Baseball Trust then uses the proceeds of such borrowings to provide loans to the club trusts of the participating Clubs, including the Braves Club Trust (the “Club Trust”). The maximum amount available to the Club Trust under the LWCF was $125.0 million as of December 31, 2024 which remains undrawn. The commitment termination date of the revolving credit facility under the LWCF, which is the repayment date for all amounts borrowed under such revolving credit facility, is July 10, 2026.
MLB Facility Fund Revolver
In December 2017, a subsidiary of Braves Holdings executed various agreements to enter into the MLB Facility Fund (the “MLBFF”). Pursuant to the terms of an indenture, a credit agreement and certain note purchase agreements, Major League Baseball Facility Fund, LLC may borrow from certain lenders. Major League Baseball Facility Fund, LLC then uses the proceeds of such borrowings to provide loans to each of the participating Clubs. Amounts advanced pursuant to the MLBFF are available to fund ballpark and other baseball-related real property improvements, renovations and/or new construction. In May 2021, Braves Facility Fund LLC established a revolving credit commitment with Major League Baseball Facility Fund, LLC (the “MLB facility fund – revolver”). The commitment termination date, which is the repayment date for all amounts borrowed under the MLB facility fund – revolver, is July 10, 2026. The maximum amount available to Braves Facility Fund LLC under the MLB facility fund – revolver was $39.1 million as of December 31, 2024 and was fully drawn as of December 31, 2024.

The Braves have entered into long-term employment contracts with certain of their players (current and former), coaches and employees. Amounts due under such contracts as of December 31, 2024 aggregated $762.7 million. In addition, certain players, coaches and executives may earn incentive compensation under the terms of their employment contracts. The Braves are under no legal obligation to pay Major League player salaries during any period that players do not render services during a labor dispute.
(4)
Amounts include obligations for capital maintenance of Truist Park and software contracts.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of Atlanta Braves Holdings’ consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Listed below are the accounting estimates that Atlanta Braves Holdings believes are critical to its consolidated financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset, liability, revenue or expense being reported. 
Non-Financial Instrument Valuations. 
Atlanta Braves Holdings’ non-financial instrument valuations are primarily comprised of its annual assessment of the recoverability of its goodwill and franchise rights (collectively, “indefinite-lived intangible assets”), and its evaluation of the recoverability of its other long-lived assets upon certain triggering events. If the carrying value of Atlanta Braves Holdings’ long-lived assets exceeds their estimated fair value, Atlanta Braves Holdings is required to write the carrying value down to fair value. Any such writedown is included in impairment of long-lived assets in the consolidated statement of operations. Judgment is required to estimate the fair value of Atlanta Braves Holdings’ long-lived assets. Atlanta Braves Holdings may use quoted market prices, prices for similar assets, present value techniques and other valuation techniques to prepare these estimates. Atlanta Braves Holdings may need to make estimates of future cash 
II-9

Table of Contents
flows and discount rates as well as other assumptions in order to implement these valuation techniques. Due to the judgment involved in Atlanta Braves Holdings’ estimation techniques, any value ultimately derived from Atlanta Braves Holdings’ long-lived assets may differ from its estimate of fair value. 
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $175.8 million of goodwill and $123.7 million of franchise rights. The Company’s goodwill and franchise rights are both entirely allocated to the Baseball reportable segment. The Company performs its annual assessment of the recoverability of its indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter each year, or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. The accounting guidance permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The accounting guidance also allows entities the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. The entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. In evaluating goodwill on a qualitative basis, the Company reviews the business performance of each reporting unit and evaluates other relevant factors as identified in the relevant accounting guidance to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indicated impairment exists for any of its reporting units. The Company considers whether there are any negative macroeconomic conditions, industry-specific conditions, market changes, increased competition, increased costs in doing business, management challenges, the legal environments and how these factors might impact company specific performance in future periods. As part of the analysis, the Company also considers fair value determinations for certain reporting units that have been made at various points throughout the current and prior year for other purposes. If based on the qualitative analysis it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, the Company performs the quantitative impairment test.
Income Taxes. 
The Company is required to estimate the amount of tax payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred income tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in its consolidated financial statements or tax returns for each taxing jurisdiction in which the Company operates. This process requires the Company’s management to make judgments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact of the various agreements and transactions that it enters into. Based on these judgments, the Company may record tax reserves or adjustments to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets to reflect the expected realizability of future tax benefits. Actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law, significant changes in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, our inability to generate sufficient future taxable income or unpredicted results from the final determination of each year’s liability by taxing authorities. These changes could have a significant impact on the Company’s financial position.
Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosu
res about Market Risk
We are exposed to market risk in the normal course of business due to our ongoing investing and financial activities and the conduct of operations. Market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in stock prices and interest rates. The risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows and future earnings. We have established policies, procedures and internal processes governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks.
We are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing activities, which include fixed and floating rate debt instruments and borrowings used to maintain liquidity and to fund business operations. The nature and amount of our long-term and short-term debt are expected to vary as a result of future requirements, market conditions and other factors. We manage our exposure to interest rates by maintaining what we believe is an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt. We believe this best protects us from interest rate risk. We have achieved this mix by (i) issuing fixed rate debt that we believe has a low stated interest rate and significant term to maturity, (ii) issuing variable rate debt with appropriate maturities and interest rates and (iii) entering into interest rate swap arrangements when we deem appropriate.
As of December 31, 2024, we had $173.5 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 6.2% and $446.6 million aggregate principal amount of fixed rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 4.4%.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 
In accordance with Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer (the “Executives”), and under the oversight of its board of directors, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the Executives concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in its reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms.
Effective September 1, 2024, as described in note 1 in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements, Liberty began transitioning certain general and administrative services previously provided by Liberty to the new members of management of Atlanta Braves Holdings, including legal, tax, accounting, treasury, information technology, cybersecurity, internal audit and investor relations support. As part of that transition, the then-current officers of the Company (with limited exceptions) stepped down from their officer positions, effective August 31, 2024, and certain members of the Braves operating team assumed these roles effective September 1, 2024. As a result of the transition, internal controls over financial reporting have materially changed as executive oversight transitioned to the new Atlanta Braves Holdings officers and the new members of management of Atlanta Braves Holdings began to perform certain accounting, financial reporting, treasury, tax and entity level internal controls over financial reporting previously performed by members of Liberty management. The impacted processes have remained generally consistent through the transition to the new control operators, and other than the transition of these internal controls over financial reporting to new process and control operators, the existing control environment has not materially changed.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over the Company’s financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. 
The Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, using the criteria in 
Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective. 
The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm audited the consolidated financial statements and related notes in the Annual Report on Form 10-K and has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Their report appears on page II-13 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
Atlanta Braves Holdings, Inc.:
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Atlanta Braves Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive earnings (loss), equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated March 3, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Atlanta Braves Holdings, Inc.:
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Atlanta Braves Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive earnings (loss), equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated March 3, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Sufficiency of audit evidence over certain baseball event revenue
As discussed in Note 2 
t
o the consolidated financial statements, baseball event revenue and broadcasting revenue are two primary sources of baseball revenue. The Company derives a portion of baseball event revenue from gameday tickets and season ticket arrangements, for which performance obligations are satisfied as the related benefits are delivered to each customer during the regular season. When consideration is received from a customer prior to transferring services to the customer under the terms of a contract, deferred revenue is recorded. The Company recognized baseball event revenue of $347.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, a portion of which related to gameday and season

tickets.  The Company recorded a liability for deferred revenue and refundable tickets of $111.9 million as of December 31, 2024, a portion of which related to deferred revenue for gameday and season ticket sales.
We identified the evaluation of the sufficiency of audit evidence over baseball event revenue related to gameday and season tickets as a critical audit matter. Evaluation of the third-party service organization used by the Company to track ticket sales required especially subjective auditor judgment as it was highly specialized to the sports and event related industry. In addition, the audit effort required specialized skills and knowledge due to the complexity of the information technology (IT) environment.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We applied auditor judgment to determine the nature and extent of procedures to be performed over baseball event related to gameday and season tickets. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s process to record baseball event revenue from gameday and season tickets. We involved IT professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in testing controls related to the Company’s general information technology and application controls related to systems utilized within the revenue recognition process. We performed a software-assisted data analysis to test relationships among gameday and season ticket revenue transactions. For a selection of revenue transactions, we compared the amounts recognized for consistency with underlying documentation and performance obligations, including contracts with customers. For a sample of deferred revenue transactions, we compared the amounts for consistency with underlying documentation and performance obligations, including contracts with customers. We evaluated the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained by assessing the results of procedures performed, including the appropriateness of the nature and extent of audit effort.

ATLANTA BRAVES HOLDINGS, INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
December 31, 2024
, 
2023
 and 
2022
(1)
Basis of Presentation
During November 2022, the board of directors of Liberty Media Corporation (“Liberty,” “Liberty Media” or “Former parent”) authorized Liberty management to pursue a plan to redeem each outstanding share of its Liberty Braves common stock in exchange for 
one
 share of the corresponding series of common stock of a newly formed entity, Atlanta Braves Holdings, Inc. (the “Split-Off”). The Split-Off was completed on July 18, 2023 and was intended to be tax-free to holders of Liberty Braves common stock and in September 2024, the Internal Revenue Service completed its review of the Split-Off and notified Liberty that it agreed with the non-taxable characterization of the transaction. Atlanta Braves Holdings, Inc. (“Atlanta Braves Holdings” or the “Company”) is comprised of the businesses, assets and liabilities of its wholly-owned subsidiary Braves Holdings, LLC (“Braves Holdings”) and corporate cash.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements 
have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and represent the combination of the historical financial information of the Liberty Braves Group until the date of the Split-Off. Although Atlanta Braves Holdings was reported as a combined company until the date of the Split-Off, all periods reported herein are referred to as consolidated. These financial statements refer to the consolidation of Braves Holdings, cash and intergroup interests in the Braves Group (prior to settlement/extinguishment) as “Atlanta Braves Holdings,” “the Company,” “us,” “we” and “our” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The Split-Off is accounted for at historical cost due to the pro rata nature of the distribution to holders of Liberty Braves common stock. 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and variable interest entities (“VIE”) where the Company determines that it is the primary beneficiary. 
For consolidated entities where our ownership interest is less than 100%, noncontrolling ownership interests are reported in our consolidated balance sheets.

All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.
Description of Business
Braves Holdings indirectly owns the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball Club (“ANLBC,” the “Atlanta Braves,” the “Braves,” the “club,” or the “team”). The Braves’ ballpark (“Truist Park” or the “Stadium”), is located in Cobb County, a suburb of Atlanta, and is leased from Cobb County, Cobb-Marietta Coliseum and Exhibit Hall Authority. Braves Holdings, through affiliated entities and third-party development partners, has developed a significant portion of the land around Truist Park for a mixed-use development that features retail, office, hotel and entertainment opportunities (the “Mixed-Use Development”).
The Braves and 
29
 other Major League baseball clubs are collectively referred to as the Clubs. The Office of the Commissioner of Baseball (the “BOC”) is an unincorporated association also doing business as Major League Baseball (“MLB”) and has as its members the Clubs. The Clubs are bound by the terms and provisions of the Major League Constitution and all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder as well as a series of other agreements and arrangements that govern the operation and management of a Club, which among other things, require each Club to comply with limitations on the amount of debt a Club can incur, revenue sharing arrangements with the other Clubs, commercial arrangements with regard to the national broadcasting of its games and other programming and commercial arrangements relating to the use of its intellectual property.
In 
January 2022
, Braves Holdings sold the 
three
 Professional Development League clubs to a third party and recognized a gain of approximately $
20.3
 million, which was allocated entirely to the 
Baseball reportable segment
. The Company did not classify these Professional Development League clubs, all of which are part of the Baseball reportable segment, as discontinued operations, as their dispositions did not represent a strategic shift that would have a major effect on the Company’s operation and financial results. Each of the 
three
 clubs remain affiliated with Braves Holdings via player development license agreements with MLB Professional Development Leagues, LLC. Additionally, Braves Holdings

granted an exclusive, royalty free, sub-licensable, and irrevocable license to use various tradenames and logos. The license fee is included within the total purchase price of approximately $
49.4
 million. 
Split-Off of Atlanta Braves Holdings from Liberty
Prior to the Split-Off, a portion of Liberty’s general and administrative expenses, including legal, tax, accounting, treasury, information technology, cybersecurity and investor relations support was allocated to the Braves Group each reporting period based on an estimate of time spent. The Braves Group paid $
4.5
 million during 2023 prior to the Split-Off and paid $
9.0
 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, for such expenses.
Prior to the Split-Off, the Liberty Formula One Group (the “Formula One Group”) and the Liberty SiriusXM Group held intergroup interests in the Braves Group. The intergroup interests represented quasi-equity interests which were not represented by outstanding shares of common stock; rather, the Formula One Group and Liberty SiriusXM Group had attributed interests in the Braves Group, which were generally stated in terms of a number of shares of Liberty Braves common stock. As of December 31, 2022, 
6,792,903
 notional shares represented an 
11.0
% intergroup interest in the Braves Group held by the Formula One Group and 
1,811,066
 notional shares represented a 
2.9
% intergroup interest in the Braves Group held by the Liberty SiriusXM Group. Historically, Liberty assumed that the notional shares (if and when issued) related to the Formula One Group interest in the Braves Group would be comprised of Series C Liberty Braves common stock and that the notional shares (if and when issued) related to the Liberty SiriusXM Group interest in the Braves Group would be comprised of Series A Liberty Braves common stock. Therefore, the market prices of Series C Liberty Braves and Series A Liberty Braves common stock were used for the mark-to-market adjustment for the intergroup interests held by the Formula One Group and the Liberty SiriusXM Group, respectively, through the consolidated statements of operations. During the second quarter of 2023, Liberty determined that, in connection with the Split-Off, shares of Atlanta Braves Holdings Series C common stock would be used to settle and extinguish the intergroup interest in the Braves Group attributed to the Liberty SiriusXM Group. Accordingly, effective as of June 30, 2023 and through the Split-Off date, the market price of Series C Liberty Braves common stock was used for the mark-to-market adjustment for the intergroup interest held by the Liberty SiriusXM Group.
The intergroup interests in the Braves Group remaining immediately prior to the Split-Off were settled and extinguished in connection with the Split-Off through the attribution, to the respective tracking stock group, of Atlanta Braves Holdings Series C common stock on a 
one
-for-one basis equal to the number of notional shares representing the intergroup interest.
Following the Split-Off and subsequent Liberty Media Exchange (as defined below), Liberty and Atlanta Braves Holdings operate as separate, publicly traded companies and neither has any continuing stock ownership, beneficial or otherwise, in the other. Liberty owned 
1,811,066
 shares of Atlanta Braves Holdings Series C common stock following the Spilt-Off. In November 2023, Liberty exchanged 
1,811,066
 shares of Atlanta Braves Holdings Series C common stock with a third-party in satisfaction of certain of Liberty’s debt obligations, and an affiliate of such third-party then sold the shares in a secondary public offering (the “Liberty Media Exchange”). Atlanta Braves Holdings did not receive any of the proceeds from the Liberty Media Exchange. 
In connection with the Split-Off, Liberty and Atlanta Braves Holdings entered into certain agreements in order to govern certain of the ongoing relationships between the two companies after the Split-Off and to provide for an orderly transition. These agreements included a reorganization agreement, a services agreement, aircraft time sharing agreements, a facilities sharing agreement, a tax sharing agreement and a registration rights agreement. The facilities sharing agreement and aircraft time sharing agreements were terminated as part of the Corporate Governance Transition (as defined below).
The reorganization agreement provides for, among other things, the principal corporate transactions (including the internal restructuring) required to affect the Split-Off, certain conditions to the Split-Off and provisions governing the relationship between Atlanta Braves Holdings and Liberty with respect to and resulting from the Split-Off. The tax sharing

Table of Contents
ATLANTA BRAVES HOLDINGS, INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
December 31, 2024
, 
2023
 and 
2022
agreement provides for the allocation and indemnification of tax liabilities and benefits between Liberty and Atlanta Braves Holdings and other agreements related to tax matters. Pursuant to the services agreement, Liberty provides Atlanta Braves Holdings with general and administrative services including legal, tax, accounting, treasury, information technology, cybersecurity and investor relations support. Atlanta Braves Holdings will reimburse Liberty for direct, out-of-pocket expenses and will pay a services fee to Liberty under the services agreement that is subject to adjustment quarterly, as necessary. Additionally, pursuant to the services agreement with Liberty and prior to the Corporate Governance Transition (as defined below), components of Liberty Chief Executive Officer’s compensation were either paid directly to him or reimbursed to Liberty, in each case, based on allocations set forth in the services agreement. The allocation percentage was 
7
% for Atlanta Braves Holdings during the period from July 18, 2023 to December 31, 2023 and was 
8
% during the period from January 1, 2024 through August 31, 2024, when the Corporate Governance Transition (as defined below) occurred. 
Pursuant to the registration rights agreement with Liberty, Atlanta Braves Holdings has registered the shares of Atlanta Braves Holdings’ Series C common stock that were issued to Liberty in settlement and extinguishment of the intergroup interest in the Braves Group attributed to the Liberty SiriusXM Group and then exchanged by Liberty with a third-party in satisfaction of certain debt obligations. The obligations of Atlanta Braves Holdings under the registration rights agreement have been satisfied in accordance with its terms. 
Under these various agreements, amounts reimbursable to Liberty aggregated $
4.6
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and $
1.8
 million for the period from July 18, 2023 to December 31, 2023.
Related Party Transactions and Change in Corporate Governance
On August 21, 2024, Terence F. McGuirk (“McGuirk”) entered into certain shareholder arrangements with Dr. John C. Malone (“Malone”), pursuant to which Malone has granted McGuirk a proxy (the “Malone Voting Agreement”) to vote 
887,079
 shares of the Company’s Series B Common Stock owned by Malone, representing 
44
% of the Company’s then outstanding voting power, on director elections, the approval or authorization of executive compensation and other routine matters. Malone has also granted McGuirk a right of first refusal with respect to future transfers of the Company shares beneficially owned by Malone as well as certain appreciation rights with respect to the value of Malone’s shares of Series B Common Stock.
The execution of the Malone Voting Agreement constituted a “Change in Control” of the Company as defined in Gregory B. Maffei’s Executive Employment Agreement, dated effective as of December 13, 2019, by and between Mr. Maffei and Liberty. As a result, on August 21, 2024, Mr. Maffei notified the Company of his resignation as President, Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the Board and a director of the Company effective August 31, 2024. Mr. Maffei’s separation from employment with the Company was for “Good Reason” within the meaning of his Executive Employment Agreement. Additionally, Atlanta Braves Holdings and Liberty have begun transitioning various general and administrative services provided by Liberty to the management of Atlanta Braves Holdings, including legal, tax, accounting, treasury, information technology, cybersecurity and investor relations support. As part of that transition, the then-current officers of the Company (with limited exceptions) stepped down from their officer positions, effective August 31, 2024, and members of the Atlanta Braves Holdings operating team assumed these roles effective September 1, 2024 (the “Corporate Governance Transition”).

Restricted Cash
Restricted cash consists of cash on deposit that is restricted for the payment of certain debt and interest obligations, debt reserves, Stadium repair and maintenance reserves and Stadium lease payments.
Accounts Receivable and Contract Assets, net of Allowance for Credit Losses
An account receivable is recorded when there is an unconditional right to consideration based on a contract with a customer. For certain types of contracts with customers, the Company may recognize revenue in advance of the contractual right to invoice the customer, resulting in an amount recorded to contract assets as required by Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
(“ASC 606”). Once the Company has an unconditional right to consideration under these contracts, the contract assets are reclassified to accounts receivable. The table below details the opening and closing balances of accounts receivable and contract assets:

The Company applies the “expected credit loss” methodology in estimating its allowance for credit losses by first considering historical losses and adding consideration of current market conditions, the customers’ financial condition, the amount of receivables in dispute, the current receivables aging and current payment patterns. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. The Company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost, less impairments, if any. Expenditures for improvements that add to the productive capacity or extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred. When depreciable properties are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts, and the resulting gain or loss is included in the consolidated statements of operations. Depreciation is recognized over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method.

Investments
Braves Holdings or certain of its subsidiaries maintain investments in various entities, including certain MLB affiliates, Georgia Ballpark Hotel Company, LLC, Battery Hotel Group, LLC and North Port Ballpark Hotel, LLC.
Investments in entities in which Braves Holdings or its subsidiaries have significant influence, but less than a controlling voting interest, are accounted for using the equity method. Significant influence is generally presumed to exist when the Company (i) owns between 20% and 50% of a voting interest in the investee, (ii) holds substantial management rights, or (iii) holds an interest greater than 3% to 5% in an investee that is a limited partnership. The presumption that exists for interests in the ranges stated above is overcome in limited circumstances if it is readily apparent based on the facts and circumstances that the investor does not have the ability to influence the financial and operating policies over the investee. Under the equity method, the investment, originally recorded at cost, is adjusted to recognize the Company’s share of net earnings or losses of the investment as they occur rather than as dividends or other distributions as they are received. Losses are limited to the extent of the Company’s investment in, advances to and commitments for the investee. 
The Company relies on management of these affiliates to provide it with accurate financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP that the Company uses in the application of the equity method. In addition, the Company relies on audit reports that are provided by the affiliates’ independent auditors on the financial statements of such affiliates. In the event the Company is unable to obtain accurate financial information from an equity affiliate in a timely manner, the Company records its share of earnings or losses on a lag. The Company is not aware of any errors in, or possible misstatements of, the financial information provided by its equity affiliates that would have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
The Company periodically reviews the carrying amounts of its investments to determine whether a decline in fair value below the carrying value is other than temporary. The primary factors the Company considers in its determination are the length of time that the fair value of the investment is below the Company’s carrying value; the severity of the decline; and the financial condition, operating performance and near term prospects of the investee. In addition, the Company considers the reason for the decline in fair value, be it general market conditions, industry specific or investee specific; changes in valuation subsequent to the balance sheet date; and the Company’s intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in fair value. If the decline in fair value is deemed to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the equity method investment is written down to fair value. In situations where the fair value of an investment is not evident due to a lack of a public market price or other factors, the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to arrive at the estimated fair value of such investment. The Company’s assessment of the foregoing factors involves judgment and accordingly, actual results may differ materially from the Company’s estimates and judgments. Write-downs for equity method investments are included in share of earnings (losses) of affiliates, net in the consolidated statements of operations.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets subject to amortization, comprised of broadcast rights, are amortized straight-line over their estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and are included in other assets, net in the consolidated balance sheets. Amortization of broadcast rights was approximately $
3.0
 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, and was included in depreciation and amortization expense in the consolidated statements of operations. 
Goodwill and franchise rights (collectively, “indefinite-lived intangible assets”) are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment at least annually. The annual impairment assessment of the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets is performed during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred.

The Company’s goodwill is allocated entirely to its Baseball reportable segment. The accounting guidance permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The accounting guidance also allows entities the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. The entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period.
In evaluating goodwill on a qualitative basis, the Company reviews the business performance of each reporting unit and evaluates other relevant factors as identified in the relevant accounting guidance to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indicated impairment exists for any of our reporting units. The Company considers whether there are any negative macroeconomic conditions, industry specific conditions, market changes, increased competition, increased costs in doing business, management challenges, the legal environments and how these factors might impact company specific performance in future periods. As part of the analysis, the Company also considers fair value determinations for certain reporting units that have been made at various points throughout the current and prior years for other purposes. The Company performed a qualitative analysis during the fourth quarter of 2024 and concluded it was not more likely than not that an impairment existed. 
If based on the qualitative analysis it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, the Company performs the quantitative impairment test. The quantitative goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. Developing estimates of fair value requires significant judgments, including making assumptions about appropriate discount rates, perpetual growth rates, relevant comparable market multiples, public trading prices and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The cash flows employed in the Company’s valuation analysis are based on management’s best estimates considering current marketplace factors and risks as well as assumptions of growth rates in future years. There is no assurance that actual results in the future will approximate these forecasts. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
The accounting guidance also permits entities to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. The accounting guidance also allows entities the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. The entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. If the qualitative assessment supports that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, exceeds its fair value, then a quantitative assessment is performed. If the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or an asset group be tested for possible impairment, the Company first compares undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. The Company generally measures fair value by considering sale prices for similar assets or by discounting estimated future cash flows using an appropriate discount rate. Management judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of asset groups. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from such estimates. Asset groups to be disposed of are carried at the lower of their financial statement carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.

Amateur Player Acquisition Rights 
Amateur player acquisition rights consist of upfront payments to players that are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Such amounts are included in other assets, net in the consolidated balance sheets. Amortization of amateur player acquisition rights was approximately $
13.4
 million, $
11.5
 million and $
11.0
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and was included in depreciation and amortization expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value
For assets and liabilities required to be reported at fair value, GAAP provides a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted market prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. 
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
All of the Company’s derivatives, whether designated as hedging relationships or not, are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings or losses. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive earnings (loss) in the consolidated statements of comprehensive earnings (loss) and are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations when the hedged item affects earnings or losses. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in net earnings (loss). If the derivative is not designated as a hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in net earnings (loss). None of the Company’s derivatives are currently designated as hedges.
Pension Plans
Braves Holdings’ current and former players as well as certain coaches, managers, trainers and assistant trainers participate in a multi-employer defined-benefit pension plan in which all of the Clubs participate and equally fund. A certain population of Braves Holdings’ non-uniformed personnel participate in a defined-benefit pension plan sponsored by Braves Holdings.
The Company records amounts relating to its Braves Holdings-sponsored plan based on calculations that incorporate various actuarial and other assumptions, including discount rates, mortality, assumed rates of return and compensation increases. The Company reviews its assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is appropriate to do so. The Company believes that the assumptions utilized in recording its obligations under its plan are reasonable based on its experience and market conditions.
The Company recognizes the funded status of the Braves Holdings-sponsored defined-benefit pension plan as a net asset or liability and recognizes changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through other comprehensive earnings (loss) in the consolidated statements of comprehensive earnings loss to the extent those changes are not included in net periodic cost. The funded status reported on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation.

Revenue Recognition
ASC 606 requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers and also requires disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract.
Revenue is recognized when, or as, performance obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied, which generally occurs when, or as, control of the promised products or services are transferred to customers. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring products or services to a customer (transaction price). To the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration, the Company estimates the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price utilizing the most likely amount to which the Company expects to be entitled. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in the Company’s judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. Estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of the Company’s anticipated performance and all information that is reasonably available.
Contracts with customers may contain multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised products or services underlying each performance obligation. The Company determines standalone selling prices based on the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately. If the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions, the Company estimates the standalone selling price considering available information, such as market conditions and internal pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations.
Significant portions of the transaction prices for Braves Holdings are related to undelivered performance obligations that are under contractual arrangements that extend beyond one year. The Company anticipates recognizing revenue from the delivery of such performance obligations of approximately $
364.3
 million in 
2025
, $
317.0
 million in 
2026
, $
278.2
 million in 
2027
, $
391.3
 million in 
2028
 through 2032 and $
133.9
 million 
thereafter
, primarily recognized through 2041. We have not included any amounts in the undelivered performance obligations amounts for those performance obligations that relate to a contract with an original expected duration of one year or less.
Sales, value add, and other taxes when collected concurrently with revenue producing activities are excluded from revenue. If, at contract inception, the Company determines the time period between when the Company transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays the Company for that good or service is one year or less, the Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component.
When consideration is received from a customer prior to transferring services to the customer under the terms of a contract, deferred revenue is recorded. The primary source of the Company’s deferred revenue relates to suite and season ticket arrangements, as well as certain sponsorship arrangements. Deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when, or as, control of the products or services are transferred to the customer and all revenue recognition criteria have been met. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had long-term deferred revenue of $
17.8
 million and $
16.4
 million, respectively, which were included in other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized $
99.8
 million, $
88.8
 million and $
81.6
 million, respectively, of revenue that was included in deferred revenue at the beginning of the respective year.
The Company reports revenue on a gross or net basis based on management’s assessment of whether the Company acts as a principal or agent in the transaction. The determination of whether the Company acts as a principal or an agent in a transaction is based on an evaluation of whether the Company controls the good or service before transfer to the customer.

 and

When the Company concludes that it controls the good or service before transfer to the customer, the Company is considered a principal in the transaction and records revenue on a gross basis. When the Company concludes that it does not control the good or service before transfer to the customer but arranges for another entity to provide the good or service, the Company acts as an agent and records revenue on a net basis in the amount it earns for its agency service.

The Company’s revenue recognition policies summarizing the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty associated with each major source of revenue from contracts with customers are described below.
Baseball Event Revenue
The Company derives event-related revenue from gameday tickets, concessions and parking. These arrangements have limited performance obligations for single or mini multigame ticket packages and include a fixed-fee transaction price. The Company’s performance obligations are satisfied as the related benefits are delivered to each customer.
In addition, the Company derives event related revenue from suite arrangements, season tickets and advertising sponsorships (in the form of Stadium signage and other sponsorship elements). These arrangements may be multiyear fee arrangements and include annual market increases. Payment terms for these arrangements can vary by contract, but payments are generally due in installments prior to each regular season. The Company’s performance obligations under such arrangements are to provide the customer with certain benefits during each regular season. The transaction price of the arrangement is allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price of each obligation. In determining the standalone selling price, the Company considers the contractually agreed-upon fees, as compared to other arrangements. The Company’s performance obligations are satisfied as the related benefits are delivered to each customer. Revenue is recognized on a per game basis during the regular season based on a pro rata share of total revenue allocated to the entire regular season to the total number of home games during the regular season.
Broadcasting Revenue
The Company derives revenue from the sale of local broadcasting rights and national broadcasting rights negotiated by the BOC on behalf of the Clubs.
Each Club has the right to authorize the television broadcast, within its home television territory, of games in which it participates, subject to certain exceptions. ANLBC has a long-term local broadcasting agreement with SportSouth Network II, LLC, a subsidiary of Main Street Sports Group, LLC, the owner and operator of the FanDuel Sports Network South and FanDuel Sports Network Southeast video programming services (formerly SportSouth, Bally Sport South or Fox Sports South and FS South, Bally Sports Southeast or Fox Sports Southeast, respectively), granting its regional cable networks the right to broadcast substantially all of the Braves games not otherwise selected for broadcast within the home

television territory of the Braves by national broadcast partners (such agreement, as amended, the “Braves Broadcast Agreement”). Over the term of the agreement, ANLBC is entitled to receive payments, subject to the actual number of games broadcast during the term. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, ANLBC receives such rights fees in monthly installments from January through August of each year. The transaction price under the local television broadcast arrangement is variable in nature as certain provisions exist as to the consideration received in certain years. The Company estimates the entire transaction price of the contractual arrangements and recognizes revenue allocated to each of the performance obligations within the contractual arrangements as those performance obligations are satisfied. In estimating the transaction price, the Company considers the contractually agreed-upon fees as well as qualitative considerations with respect to the number of games expected to be broadcast. The resulting transaction price is allocated entirely to each contract year as stated in the contractual agreement and revenue is recognized using an output measure of progress toward satisfaction of the Company’s performance obligations within the contract year, as the underlying benefits are provided.
The Company also participates in the revenue generated from national television and radio broadcast arrangements negotiated by the BOC on behalf of the Clubs with ESPN Inc., Turner Broadcasting System, Inc., Fox Broadcasting Company, Sirius XM Satellite Radio and others (the “National Broadcast Rights”). Under the rules and regulations adopted by MLB, as well as a series of other agreements and arrangements that govern the operation and management of a Club, the BOC has the authority, acting as the agent on behalf of the Clubs, to enter into and administer all contracts for the sale of National Broadcast Rights. The transaction prices under national broadcasting rights arrangements are typically fixed and are allocated to each performance obligation within the contractual arrangements. The fixed license fees are allocated to each of the performance obligations within the contractual arrangements, based on the standalone selling price of the intellectual property. The resulting transaction price is allocated entirely to the rights provided for the related contract year, and revenue is recognized using an output measure of progress toward satisfaction of the Company’s performance obligations within the contract year, which is generally as games are made available for use under license agreement.
Retail and Licensing Revenue
The Company has retail merchandise sales primarily at the Stadium. Sales of merchandise are recorded at the point of sale, net of returns. The Company has elected to present sales taxes on a net basis. 
The Company participates in an agency arrangement along with the other 
29
 Clubs whereby net revenue generated from licensing arrangements with third parties is divided equally among the Clubs. The transaction price is based upon the expected distribution values as communicated by MLB. The timing of revenue recognition and receipt of this revenue is dependent on the nature of the underlying performance obligation, which is generally over time. 
Mixed-Use Development Revenue
The Company receives lease income as the lessor for certain buildings and land in the Mixed-Use Development. Revenue from minimum rents is recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of their respective lease agreements. Some retail tenants are required to pay overage rents based on sales over a stated base amount during the lease term. Overage rents are only recognized when each tenant’s sales exceed the applicable sales threshold. Tenants reimburse the Company for a substantial portion of the Company’s operating expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes and property insurance. The Company accrues reimbursements from tenants for recoverable portions of all these expenses as revenue in the period the applicable expenditures are incurred. The Company recognizes differences between estimated recoveries and the final billed amounts in the subsequent year. 
Parking and sponsorship revenue comprise a relatively small portion of Mixed-Use Development revenue. Sponsorship revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over each annual period. Parking revenue is recognized daily based on actual usage.

Compensation to Players and Other Baseball Personnel
Player and other baseball personnel contracts are expensed based on a systematic and rational method where the expense typically follows the annual contractual amounts payable for each season. If compensation is earned currently but is to be paid in future periods, the earned amount, net of imputed interest based on the expected payout period, is charged to expense, and amounts not paid are reflected as either a current or noncurrent liability in the consolidated balance sheets. Interest imputed on these obligations is amortized and charged to expense using the effective interest method and reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as interest expense. Interest income for these investments is recognized when earned in the other, net line in the consolidated statements of operations.
In the event the Club terminates a player’s contract where the reason for the player’s failure is not based on an act of the player that is proscribed by the contract, the Club may be required to make minimum payments to the player for the balance of the contract’s term. With respect to such payments, the present value of the remaining unpaid balance of that contract, including unamortized capitalized signing bonuses, is expensed in the baseball operating costs line in the consolidated statements of operations in the year the person is released, and any unpaid amounts are included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. If it is probable that an injury will prevent a player from playing in future periods, the present value of compensation to be earned during those periods, net of any insurance proceeds, is expensed in the baseball operating costs line in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the injury was determined to prevent future play.
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs aggregated $
5.0
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and $
5.2
 million in each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 and were recorded in the selling, general and administrative, including stock-based compensation expenses line in the consolidated statements of operations.
Stock-Based Compensation
As more fully described in note 11, Atlanta Braves Holdings has granted to its directors, employees and employees of its subsidiaries, restricted stock (“RSAs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and stock options to purchase shares of Atlanta Braves Holdings common stock (collectively, “Awards”). The Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for Awards based on the grant date fair value of the Award, and recognizes that cost over the period during which the employee is required to provide service (usually the vesting period of the Awards). The Company estimates grant date fair value using the Black-Scholes valuation model. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $
16.5
 million, $
13.2
 million and $
12.2
 million, respectively. These amounts are included in selling, general and administrative, including stock-based compensation expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset-and-liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Net deferred tax assets are then reduced by a valuation allowance if the Company believes it is more likely than not such net deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely

of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.
Comprehensive Earnings (Loss)
Comprehensive earnings (loss) consists of net earnings (loss), comprehensive earnings (loss) attributable to unrealized gains (loss) on marketable securities and the Company’s share of the comprehensive earnings (loss) of our equity method affiliates.
Earnings Attributable to Atlanta Braves Holdings Stockholders Per Common Share 
Basic earnings (loss) per common share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net earnings (loss) attributable to Atlanta Braves Holdings stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding (“WASO”) for the period. Diluted EPS presents the dilutive effect on a per share basis of potential common shares as if they had been converted at the beginning of the periods presented. Excluded from diluted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 are 
zero
 and 
313
 thousand potentially dilutive shares of common stock, respectively, because their inclusion would have been antidilutive.
The Company issued 
61.7
 million common shares, which is the aggregate number of shares of Series A, Series B and Series C common stock issued in connection with the Split-Off on July 18, 2023. The number of shares issued upon completion of the Split-Off was used to determine both basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share for the year ended December 31, 2022, as 
no
 Company equity awards were outstanding prior to the completion of the Split-Off.

Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company considers (i) fair value measurements of non-financial instruments and (ii) accounting for income taxes to be its most significant estimates.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07,

Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
, which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through additional disclosures about significant segment expenses. The standard became effective on January 1, 2024. These additional disclosure requirements will be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the consolidated financial statements and are located in note 14. 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09
, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
, which requires more detailed income tax disclosures. The guidance requires entities to disclose disaggregated information about their effective tax rate reconciliation as well as expanded information on income taxes paid by jurisdiction. The disclosure requirements will be applied on a prospective basis, with the option to apply them retrospectively. The effective date for the standard is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the new standard on the related disclosures.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03,

MLBAM
MLB Advanced Media, L.P. (“MLBAM”) was formed in January 2000 pursuant to a vote of the 
30
 owners of the Clubs, whereby each Club agreed to cede substantially all of its individual Club internet and interactive media rights to MLBAM for an indirect 
3.3
% interest in MLBAM. The Company’s investment in MLBAM is considered an equity method investment as the investment is in a limited partnership where significant influence is generally presumed to exist. 
At the time of the acquisition of ANLBC by a predecessor of Liberty in 2007, the fair value of the MLBAM investment exceeded ANLBC’s proportionate share of MLBAM’s net assets, resulting in excess basis in the investment in MLBAM. The excess basis as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was indefinite lived and aggregated to approximately $
10.3
 million. 
BELP
Baseball Endowment, L.P. (“BELP”) is an investment fund formed by the Clubs principally for the purpose of investing, on a long-term basis, assets on their behalf intended to provide a competitive market rate investment return while minimizing investment volatility. The Company’s investment in BELP is considered an equity method investment as the investment is in a limited partnership where significant influence is generally presumed to exist. The Company records its share of BELP’s earnings (losses) on a 
one month
 lag.
The investments held by BELP are recorded at fair value. Investments in open-end mutual funds are valued at such fund’s closing net asset value per share on the date of valuation. The investments in investment funds represent BELP’s proportionate share of the investment funds’ partners’ capital, or net asset value, as reported by the underlying investment fund managers. The net asset values (“NAV”), or their equivalents were used, as a practical expedient under GAAP, in determining the fair values of these investments. Investments in common stock and exchange-traded funds, which are traded on a securities exchange, are generally valued at the last reported sales price on the day of valuation. Investments in fixed-income securities are valued at quoted prices provided by independent pricing vendors. In the absence of readily determinable market prices or in the absence of a formal securities exchange, investments are valued at their fair value as determined by management. If a readily determinable market price or a formal securities exchange was available, these fair values could be materially different. In determining the fair value of such an investment, BELP management considers recent transactions in the investment, if available, and the investment prospects for the future, which include an analysis of the financial condition, cash flows and capital structure of the investment.
As required by GAAP, investments are classified within the level of the lowest significant input considered in determining fair value. In evaluating the level at which BELP’s investments have been classified, BELP management has assessed factors, including, but not limited to, price transparency, and the existence or absence of certain restrictions at the measurement date. BELP management generally classifies investments in exchange-traded equities, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds as Level 1 investments and fixed-income securities as Level 2 investments, and classifies other investments without a readily determinable market price as Level 3 investments. Historically, BELP management has maintained less than 10% of the underlying investments in Level 3.

Braves Holdings has 
50
% interests in 
three
 joint ventures that were formed to develop, own and operate hotels in the Mixed-Use Development. The equity method of accounting is applied to these investments as Braves Holdings does not have the ability to direct the most significant activities that impact their economic performance. In addition, Braves Holdings records its share of the earnings (losses) of these investments on a 
three month
 lag.
Summary Financial Information
In accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission rules, the Company must determine which, if any, of its equity method investments is a “significant subsidiary.” The rules mandate the use of three different tests to determine if any of the Company’s equity securities are significant subsidiaries: the investment test, the asset test and the income test. The table below provides the summarized financial information

required by Rule 4-08(g) of Regulation S-X for all of the Company’s equity method investments that met the significance criteria, when aggregated.

League Wide Credit Facility
In December 2013, a subsidiary of Braves Holdings executed various agreements to enter into MLB’s League Wide Credit Facility (the “LWCF”). Braves Holdings also established a special purpose Delaware statutory trust, the Braves Club Trust (the “Club Trust”), and transferred, among other things, to the Club Trust its rights to receive distributions of revenue from the National Broadcasting Contracts, which secure borrowings under the LWCF. Pursuant to the terms of a revolving credit agreement, Major League Baseball Trust may borrow from certain lenders, with Bank of America, N.A. acting as the administrative agent. Major League Baseball Trust then uses the proceeds of such borrowings to provide loans to the club trusts of the participating Clubs. Major League Baseball Trust has granted Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, the collateral agent in respect of the LWCF, a first priority lien to secure the borrowings under the LWCF. The maximum amount available to the Club Trust under the LWCF was $
125.0
 million as of December 31, 2024. The commitment termination date of the revolving credit facility under the LWCF, which is the repayment date for all amounts borrowed under such revolving credit facility, is July 10, 2026. 
Under the LWCF, the Club Trust can request a revolving credit advance in the form of a Eurodollar or Base Rate loan. Each loan bears interest on the unpaid principal amount from the date made through maturity at a rate determined by the Eurodollar or Base Rate, plus an applicable margin. The interest rate of a Eurodollar loan was 
one-month London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”)
 plus a margin of 
1.20
% to 
1.325
%, based on the credit rating of Major League Baseball Trust. The interest rate of a 
Base Rate
 loan was the greater of (x) the 
Federal Funds
 rate plus 
0.50
%, (y) the prevailing Prime, and (z) 
LIBOR
 plus 
1.00
%, plus a margin of 
0.200
% to 
0.325
%, based on the credit rating of Major League Baseball Trust. Beginning in May 2022, interest based on LIBOR under the LWCF was replaced with interest based on the 
Secured Overnight Financing Rate
 (“SOFR”) plus 
0.1
%. Borrowings outstanding under the LWCF bore interest at a rate of 
5.63
% and 
6.65
% per annum as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The LWCF also has a commitment fee equal to 
0.20
% per annum on the daily unused amount of the revolving credit facility.

Pursuant to the terms of an indenture, a credit agreement and certain note purchase agreements, Major League Baseball Facility Fund, LLC may borrow from certain lenders. Major League Baseball Facility Fund, LLC then uses the proceeds of such borrowings to provide loans to each of the participating Clubs.

Term
In June 2020, Braves Facility Fund converted previous borrowings under a revolving credit advance to a $

Under a credit agreement, Braves Facility Fund can request a revolving credit advance in the form of a Eurodollar or Base Rate loan. Each loan bears interest on the unpaid principal amount from the date made through maturity at a rate determined by a Eurodollar or Base Rate, plus an applicable margin. The interest rate of a Eurodollar loan was 
one-month LIBOR
 plus a margin of 
1.275
% to 
1.400
%, based on the credit rating of Major League Baseball Facility Fund, LLC. The interest rate of a 
Base Rate
 loan was the greater of (x) the

 rate plus 
0.50
%, (y) the prevailing Prime rate, and (z) 
LIBOR
 plus 
1.00
%, plus a margin of 
0.275
% to 
0.400
%, based on the credit rating of Major League Baseball Facility Fund, LLC. Beginning in May 2022, interest based on LIBOR under the MLB facility fund – revolver was replaced with interest based on the 
SOFR
 plus 
0.1
%. Borrowings outstanding under the MLB facility fund – revolver bore interest at a rate of 
5.71
% and 
6.73
% per annum as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The MLB facility fund – revolver also has a commitment fee equal to 
0.20
% per annum on the daily unused amount of the revolver.
TeamCo Revolver
In September 2016, a subsidiary of Braves Holdings amended a revolving credit agreement (the “TeamCo Revolver”) that provided for revolving commitments of $
85
 million. Under the agreement, Braves Holdings can request a revolving credit loan in the form of a Eurodollar or Base Rate loan. Each loan bears interest on the unpaid principal amount from the date made through maturity at a rate determined by a Eurodollar or Base Rate, plus an applicable margin. The interest rate of a 
Base Rate
 loan was the greater of (x) the prevailing Prime rate, (y) the prevailing 
Federal Funds
 rate plus 
0.50
%, and (z) 
LIBOR
 plus 
1.00
%, plus a margin of 
0.25
%. In August 2022, the TeamCo Revolver was amended, increasing the borrowing capacity to $
150.0
 million, extending the maturity to August 2029 and replacing the LIBOR interest rate with SOFR. Borrowings outstanding under the TeamCo Revolver bore interest at a rate of 
5.58
% and 
6.60
% per annum as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and had availability of $
150.0

Leases
The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease (operating or finance) at inception. Braves Holdings primarily leases baseball stadiums and facilities, parking decks and surface lots, storage facilities and equipment. Leased assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and the lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.
In 2013, Braves Holdings entered into an agreement with Cobb County and the Exhibit Hall Authority to lease the Stadium. The agreement obligates Braves Holdings to play all home games in this facility beginning in 2017 through the 2046 season, with a 
5-year

extension
 option to 2051. In 2017, Braves Holdings entered into an agreement with Sarasota County, Florida to lease a spring training facility and stadium. The agreement obligates Braves Holdings to play all spring training home games in this facility beginning in 2020 through the 2049 season, with 
two

5-year

extension
 options to 2059. Both leases are classified as finance leases and are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments using Braves Holdings’ incremental borrowing rate.
Operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future lease payments using Braves Holdings’ incremental borrowing rate at the commencement date of the lease. Variable lease payments not based on an index or rate are not included in the operating lease liability as they cannot be reasonably estimated and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. The Company accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single component. Leases that have a term of 12 months or less upon commencement date are considered short-term in nature. Accordingly, short-term leases are not included on the consolidated balance sheets and are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The Company’s leases have remaining lease terms of 
one
 to 
thirty-five years
, some of which may 
include
 the option to extend for up to 
ten years
, and some of which include options to terminate the 
leases
 within 
one year
. The Company determines the lease term by assuming the exercise of any renewal and/or early termination options that are reasonably assured.

Lessor Arrangements
Braves Holdings receives lease income as the lessor for certain buildings and land in the Mixed-Use Development. Lease income is generally fixed over the duration of the contract and each lease contract contains clauses permitting extension or termination. Braves Holdings assesses the probability of payments at commencement of the lease contract and subsequently recognizes lease income over the lease term on a straight-line basis. Lease options for purchase of the leased asset by the lessee are generally not included. Some retail tenants are required to pay overage rents based on sales over a stated base amount during the lease term. Lease income is included within Mixed-Use Development revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.
Braves Holdings is a party primarily to operating leases and currently does not have significant sales-type or direct financing leases. Braves Holdings continues to measure and disclose the underlying assets subject to operating leases as property and equipment.
Deferred leasing costs consist primarily of capitalized third-party expenses in connection with lease originations. The Company records amortization of deferred leasing costs on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases. Deferred lease costs are included in other noncurrent assets in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Amortization of deferred leasing costs was approximately $
2.0
 million, $
1.7
 million and $
1.6
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and was recorded in depreciation and amortization expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
Future minimum rentals to be received under noncancelable tenant operating leases for each of the next five years and thereafter, excluding tenant reimbursements of operating expenses and overage rent based on tenant sales volume as of December 31, 2024, are as follows (amounts in thousands):

Pension and Other Benefit Plans
Braves Holdings participates in the Major League Baseball Players Pension Plan (the “Players’ Pension Plan”) which is a multiemployer defined-benefit pension plan covering players as well as certain coaches, managers, trainers and assistant trainers of the Clubs. The plan provides retirement, disability and death benefits for eligible participants based on specific eligibility/participation requirements, vesting periods and benefit formulas. The Players’ Pension Plan is identified by Employer Identification Number 
51-0185287
 and three-digit pension plan number 
001
. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the “PPA”) implemented requirements to categorize multiemployer pension plans based on funded status and other factors and impose certain restrictions on plans placed within a particular category. The Players’ Pension Plan has been certified as being in “green zone” status for the plan years commencing April 1, 2023 and 2022 and has not been categorized as endangered or critical since the implementation of the PPA. The risks to employers participating in a multiemployer plan are different from single employer plans in the following aspects:
●
Contributions to the plan made by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating Clubs.
●
Under certain conditions, if a participating Club stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers.
●
If Braves Holdings chose to stop participating in the plan, it may be required to pay the plan an amount based on the unfunded vested liabilities of the plan, which is known as a withdrawal liability.
Additionally, Braves Holdings participates in the Major League Baseball Players Welfare Plan (the “Players’ Welfare Plan”), which provides healthcare, dental, vision and life insurance benefits to current and former players, coaches, managers, trainers, assistant trainers and their surviving spouses and employees of the Major League Baseball Players Association (the “MLBPA”) who meet certain eligibility requirements.
The aggregate contribution to the Players’ Pension Plan and Players’ Welfare Plan is specified in the CBA (as defined in note 13) and divided equally among the Clubs so that each Club’s contribution is 
3.33
% of the total amount contributed each year. The total annual contribution is allocated between the Players’ Pension Plan and the Players’ Welfare Plan at the discretion of MLB’s Pension Committee and the MLBPA. Braves Holdings contributed approximately $
6.8
 million, $
6.8
 million and $
6.5
 million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, to the Players’ Pension Plan and the Players’ Welfare Plan, which is included as an expense within baseball operating costs in the consolidated statements of operations.
Certain of Braves Holdings’ non-uniformed personnel participate in a defined-benefit pension plan (the “Non-Uniformed Personnel Pension Plan”). Benefits under the Non-Uniformed Personnel Pension Plan generally are based on an employee’s years of service and compensation during the years immediately preceding retirement. Braves Holdings’ funding policy is to contribute amounts deductible for federal income tax purposes, which may vary from pension costs for financial reporting purposes. Braves Holdings uses a December 31 measurement date for the Non-Uniformed Personnel Pension Plan.
During October 2020, Braves Holdings amended the Non-Uniformed Personnel Pension Plan, which limited future participation. Specifically, employees hired or re-hired on or after October 1, 2020 are not eligible to participate in the Non-Uniformed Personnel Pension Plan. Effective December 31, 2030, Non-Uniformed Personnel Pension Plan will be permanently frozen to future benefit accruals.

Braves Holdings expects to contribute $

The discount rate assumptions reflect the rates at which Braves Holdings believes the benefit obligations could be effectively settled. The discount rates were determined based on the yield for a portfolio of high-quality corporate bonds with maturity dates matched to the estimated future payments of the plans’ benefit obligations. The expected return on plan assets assumption is intended to be a long-term rate and relates to earnings expected on funds invested or to be invested to provide for benefits reflected in the projected benefit obligation. In developing the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, Braves Holdings evaluated input from actuaries and from pension fund investment advisers, including such advisers’ review of the plan’s historical actual returns.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized a tax benefit less than the expected federal tax rate of 
21
% due primarily to executive compensation that is not deductible for tax purposes, partially offset by the effect of state income taxes.
During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized a tax benefit less than the expected federal tax rate of 
21
% due primarily to intergroup interest losses that are not deductible for tax purposes.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized tax expense instead of a tax benefit at the expected federal tax rate of 
21
% primarily due to intergroup interest losses that are not deductible for tax purposes and the reduction of goodwill as a result of the sale of the Professional Development League clubs that is also not deductible for tax purposes.

 million for state net operating losses (“NOLs”) and federal and state interest expense carryforwards. The Company has $
6.6
 million of state NOLs and $
14.3

As of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, 
no
 unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded. As of December 31, 2024, Liberty Media’s tax years prior to 2021 are closed for federal income tax purposes.

The Company’s 2023 tax year has not been audited by the IRS. The IRS is reviewing the Company’s 2024 tax year as part of the IRS’s compliance assurance process audit program. Various states are currently examining Liberty Media’s prior years’ state income tax returns. The Company does not expect the ultimate disposition of these audits to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. The Company is not under audit in any state or local jurisdiction.

Incentive Plans
Prior to the Split-Off and pursuant to the Liberty Media Corporation 2022 Omnibus Incentive Plan, Liberty granted, to certain of its directors, employees and employees of its subsidiaries, RSAs, RSUs and stock options to purchase shares of Liberty Braves common stock (collectively, “Awards”). At the time of the Split-Off, the Awards were exchanged into RSAs, RSUs and stock options to purchase shares of Atlanta Braves Holdings common stock.
Subsequent to the Split-Off, the Company can grant, to certain of its directors, employees and employees of its subsidiaries, RSAs, RSUs and stock options to purchase shares of its common stock, under the Atlanta Braves Holdings 2023 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2023 Plan”) and may grant Awards in respect of a maximum of

 million shares of Atlanta Braves Holdings common stock.
Awards generally vest over 
1
-
5 years
 and have a term of 
7
-
8 years
. The Company issues new shares upon exercise or settlement, as applicable, of Awards. The Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an equity classified Award (such as RSAs, RSUs and stock options) based on the grant-date fair value (“GDFV”) of the Award, and recognizes that cost over the period during which the employee is required to provide service (usually the vesting period of the Award). The Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for a liability classified Award based on the current fair value of the Award, and remeasures the fair value of the Award at each reporting date.

In connection with the Liberty Chief Executive Officer’s employment agreement, Liberty granted 
35
 thousand performance-based RSUs of Atlanta Braves Holdings Series C common stock to the Liberty Chief Executive Officer in March 2024. Such RSUs had a GDFV of $
38.58
 per share. In August 2024, and in connection with the Corporate Governance Transition, such RSUs were vested in full as to the target number of shares underlying such RSUs. 
The Company has calculated the GDFV for all of its equity classified awards using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The Company estimates the expected term of the Awards based on historical exercise and forfeiture data. For grants made in 2023 and 2022, the range of expected terms was 
5.55
 to 
5.64
 years. The volatility used in the calculation for Awards is based on the historical volatility of Atlanta Braves Holdings common stock (and previously, Liberty Braves common stock). For grants made in 2023 and 2022, the range of volatilities was 
33.3
% to 
35.0
%. The Company uses a 
zero
 dividend rate and the risk-free rate for Treasury Bonds with a term similar to that of the subject options.

 Commitments and Contingencies
Collective Bargaining Agreement
In March 2022, the Major League Baseball Players Association (“MLBPA”) and the Clubs entered into a new collective bargaining agreement that covers the 2022-2026 MLB seasons (“CBA”). 
The CBA contains provisions surrounding revenue sharing among the Clubs, a competitive balance tax on Club payrolls that exceed specified thresholds, minimum player salary levels, an expanded postseason schedule and other provisions impacting Braves Holdings’ operations and its relationships with members of the MLBPA. Braves Holdings’ minor league players are also parties to a collective bargaining agreement. Approximately 
13
% of the Company’s labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements. 
There are 
two
 components of the revenue sharing plan that each Club is subject to under the CBA: a straight base revenue pool (the “Pool”) and the Commissioner Discretionary Fund. The size of the Pool is equal to the total amount transferred if each Club contributed 
48
% of its prior years’ net defined local revenue (“NDLR”). The contributions per Club are based on a composite of the prior 
three years
’ NDLR and funds are distributed equally to all Clubs. Certain Clubs are disqualified from revenue sharing from the Pool based on market size. Club submissions of NDLR are subject to audit by the MLB Revenue Sharing Administrator and are subject to rules issued by the MLB Revenue Sharing Definitions Committee.
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, Braves Holdings incurred $
42.3
 million, $
26.0
 million and $
16.0
 million, respectively, in revenue sharing, which is included as an expense within baseball operating costs in the consolidated statements of operations.
Employment Contracts
Long-term employment contracts provide for, among other items, annual compensation for certain players (current and former) and other employees. As of December 31, 2024, amounts payable annually under such contracts aggregated to $
221.1
 million in 2025, $
169.2

million in 2026, $
120.9

million in 2027, $
105.2

million in 2028, $
63.1

million in 2029 and $
83.2

million, combined, thereafter. Additionally, these contracts may include incentive compensation (although certain incentive compensation awards cannot be earned by more than one player per season).

Subsequent to December 31, 2024, Braves Holdings entered into long-term employment contracts with certain players, pursuant to which approximately $
45.3
 million is anticipated to be paid through 2027 according to the terms of such contracts, excluding any incentive compensation.
Diamond Sports Group Bankruptcy
As disclosed in note 2, ANLBC has a long-term local broadcasting agreement with SportSouth Network II, LLC, a subsidiary of Diamond Sports Group (now Main Street Sports Group, LLC), granting its regional cable networks the right to broadcast substantially all of the Braves games not otherwise selected for broadcast within the home television territory of the Braves (such agreement, as amended, the “Braves Broadcast Agreement”). In March 2023, Diamond Sports Group along with certain affiliates (collectively, the “Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 (the “Chapter 11 Proceeding”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (the “Bankruptcy Court”).
​
On February 12, 2024, the Bankruptcy Court entered an agreed order among the Debtors, ANLBC and certain other MLB Clubs who have broadcast agreements with Diamond Sports Group or its affiliates, and the BOC, whereby the Debtors agreed not to reject or cause the termination of various club broadcasting agreements, including the Braves Broadcast Agreement, before the end of the 2024 MLB Season (the “Agreed Order”). The Agreed Order provided other protections to ANLBC, MLB and the other covered Clubs to give some assurance that the Debtors would pay all required fees under the various club broadcasting agreements, including the Braves Broadcast Agreement, until the earlier to occur of (i) a plan of reorganization is confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court and the Debtors exit bankruptcy and (ii) the final payment for the 2024 MLB season is paid.
​
The Debtors filed their Disclosure Statement (the “Disclosure Statement”) and Joint Plan of Reorganization (the “Joint Plan of Reorganization”) on April 17, 2024. The Bankruptcy Court approved the Disclosure Statement and originally scheduled a hearing to consider confirmation of the Joint Plan of Reorganization for June 18, 2024 (the “Confirmation Hearing”). The Confirmation Hearing was originally adjourned to July 29-30, 2024, but on July 24, 2024, the Confirmation Hearing was further adjourned indefinitely. On September 3, 2024, the Debtors announced their intention to further amend the Disclosure Statement and Joint Plan of Reorganization in hopes of setting the Confirmation Hearing for some time in November 2024. On October 2, 2024, the Debtors filed their First Amended Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization (the “Amended Plan”) as well as their Disclosure Statement Supplement for the Debtors’ First Amended Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization (the “Disclosure Statement Supplement”). The Debtors filed a further revised version of the Amended Plan (the “Revised Amended Plan”) on October 9, 2024. On October 9, 2024, the Bankruptcy Court approved the Disclosure Statement Supplement and scheduled the Confirmation Hearing to consider the Revised Amended Plan for November 14, 2024. On November 14, 2024, the Debtors filed a further revised version of the Revised Amended Plan and the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving the Revised Amended Plan. Upon the Revised Amended Plan becoming effective on January 2, 2025, Diamond Sports Group exited bankruptcy and is now operating as Main Street Sports Group, LLC.

To date and throughout the Chapter 11 Proceeding, ANLBC has received all scheduled payments in accordance with the Braves Broadcast Agreement. The obligations of Diamond Sports Group and certain of its affiliates under the Agreed Order have been satisfied in accordance with its terms. 
​
Litigation
Braves Holdings, along with the BOC and other MLB affiliates, has been named in a number of lawsuits arising in the normal course of business. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate developments in legal matters that could affect the amount of the liability accrual and make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount of a loss or potential loss. We may be unable to reasonably estimate the

reasonably possible loss or range of loss for a particular legal contingency for various reasons, including, among others, because: (i) the damages sought are indeterminate; (ii) the proceedings are in the relative early stages; (iii) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending proceedings (including motions and appeals); (iv) there is uncertainty as to the likelihood of settlement and the outcome of any negotiations with respect thereto; (v) there remain significant factual issues to be determined or resolved; (vi) the relevant law is unsettled; or (vii) the proceedings involve novel or untested legal theories. In such instances, there may be considerable uncertainty regarding the ultimate resolution of such matters, including a possible eventual loss, if any. In the opinion of management, it is expected that amounts, if any, which may be required to satisfy such contingencies will not be material in relation to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

 Segment Information
The Company, through its ownership of Braves Holdings, is primarily engaged in the entertainment and real estate industries. The Company’s chief operating decision maker, the chief executive officer, evaluates performance and makes decisions about allocating resources to its operating segments based on financial measures such as revenue and Adjusted OIBDA (as defined below). In addition, the Company reviews nonfinancial measures such as attendance, viewership and social media.
The Company defines Adjusted OIBDA as operating income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, separately reported litigation settlements, restructuring, acquisition and impairment charges. The Company believes this measure is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of its businesses, by identifying those items that are not directly a reflection of each business’ performance or indicative of ongoing business trends. In addition, this measure allows management to view operating results and perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. This measure of performance excludes depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, separately reported litigation settlements, restructuring, acquisition and impairment charges that are included in the measurement of operating income pursuant to GAAP. Accordingly, Adjusted OIBDA should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, operating income, net earnings (loss), cash flow provided by operating activities and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The Company identifies its reportable segments as those operating segments that represent 10% or more of its combined annual revenue, annual Adjusted OIBDA (as defined below) or total assets. Additionally, the Company considers how each operating segment is managed due to the products and services offered, the technologies used, the revenue sources generated, and marketing strategies deployed when evaluating its reportable segments. As a result, the Company has identified the following as its reportable segments:
●
Baseball – operations relating to Braves baseball and Truist Park and includes ticket sales, concessions, advertising sponsorships, suites and premium seat fees, broadcasting rights, retail and licensing.
●
Mixed-Use Development – includes 
retail, office, hotel and entertainment operations primarily within The Battery Atlanta.
