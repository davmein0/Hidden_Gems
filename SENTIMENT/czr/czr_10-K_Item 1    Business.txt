Item 1.    Business
Overview
We are a geographically diversified gaming and hospitality company that was founded in 1973 by the Carano family with the opening of the Eldorado Hotel Casino in Reno, Nevada. Beginning in 2005, we grew through a series of acquisitions, including the acquisition of MTR Gaming Group, Inc. in 2014, Isle of Capri Casinos, Inc. in 2017, Tropicana Entertainment, Inc. in 2018, Caesars Entertainment Corporation in 2020, and William Hill PLC in 2021. Our ticker symbol on the NASDAQ Stock Market is “CZR.”
Our primary source of revenue is generated by our gaming operations, which includes retail and online sports betting and online gaming. Additionally, we utilize our hotels, restaurants, bars, entertainment, racing, retail shops and other services to attract customers to our properties.
As of December 31, 2024, we own, lease or manage an aggregate of 53 domestic properties in 18 states. We also operate and conduct sports wagering across 32 jurisdictions in North America, 26 of which offer online sports betting, and operate iGaming in five jurisdictions in North America. We currently operate the Caesars Sportsbook app, the Caesars Racebook app, the Caesars Palace Online Casino app and the new Horseshoe Online Casino app which initially launched in October 2024. We expect to continue to grow our operations in the Caesars Digital segment as new jurisdictions legalize retail and online sports betting and iGaming. In addition, we have other properties in North America that are authorized to use the brands and marks of Caesars Entertainment, Inc., as well as other non-gaming properties. We lease certain real property assets from third parties, including GLP Capital, L.P., the operating partnership of Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc. (“GLPI”) and VICI Properties L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (“VICI”). See 
Item 2, “Properties,”
 for more information about our properties. 
Business Operations
Our consolidated business is composed of complementary businesses that reinforce, cross-promote, and build upon each other: casino, which includes our retail and online sports betting and iGaming, food and beverage, hotel, casino management or branding, entertainment, retail and other business operations.
Casino Operations
Our casino operations generate revenues from approximately 51,400 slot machines, 2,800 table games, including poker, sports betting from our retail and online sportsbooks, iGaming and other games such as keno, all of which comprised approximately 56% of our total net revenues in 2024. Slot revenues generate the majority of our casino revenues.
Retail and Online Sports Betting and iGaming
The Company operates and conducts sports wagering across 32 jurisdictions in North America, 26 of which offer online sports betting, and operates iGaming in five jurisdictions in North America as of December 31, 2024. We offer hundreds of online casino games including slots, table games, live dealer and video poker and we expect to increase our product offerings as iGaming is legalized in additional states. We continue to leverage the World Series of Poker (“WSOP”) brand within the United States with the licensing agreement that we entered into concurrently with the sale of WSOP brand on October 29, 2024.

Our Caesars Sportsbook app operates on our owned and integrated technology platform we have labeled Liberty (“Liberty”). The app offers extensive pre-match and live markets, extensive odds and flexible limits, player props, and same-game parlays. In addition to the Caesars Sportsbook app, we partnered with NYRABets LLC, the official online wagering platform of the New York Racing Association, Inc. and operate the Caesars Racebook app in 22 states. The Caesars Racebook app provides access for pari-mutuel wagering at over 300 racetracks around the world as well as livestreaming of races. Additionally, we launched our Caesars Palace Online Casino app in 2023 and initially launched the new Horseshoe Online Casino app in October 2024. Wagers placed can earn credits towards the Caesars Rewards loyalty program or points which can be redeemed for free wagering credits. No customers under 21 years old are allowed to wager on any of our Caesars Sportsbook, Caesars Racebook and iGaming mobile apps. Growth in the Caesars Digital segment continues to be realized with the strategic expansion into new states as jurisdictions legalize retail and online sports betting, iGaming and online horse race wagering.
Sports Brand Partnerships — 
Caesars Sportsbook has partnerships with the NFL, NBA, NHL, MLB, and several individual teams. We have continued to create new partnerships among professional sports teams and entered into a 20-year exclusive naming-rights partnership branding the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans in 2021. Our strategy includes developing local and national partnerships that align our sportsbooks, casinos, resorts and brands with sports fans. We have high-profile exclusive sports entertainment partnerships with the NFL, making Caesars the first-ever “Official Casino Sponsor” in the history of the league. This historic partnership combines the NFL’s legendary events with our properties to bring unique experiences to our patrons. This includes exclusive rights to use NFL trademarks to promote our properties and enabling Caesars to host exclusive special events and experiences. 
Food and Beverage Operations
Our food and beverage operations generate revenues from our dining venues, bars, nightclubs, and lounges located throughout our casinos and represented approximately 15% of our total net revenues in 2024. Many of our properties include several dining options, ranging from upscale dining experiences to moderately-priced restaurants, some of which offer pickup or in-room delivery options.
Hotel Operations
Hotel operations generate revenues from hotel stays at our properties in our approximately 45,600 guest rooms and suites and represented approximately 18% of our total net revenues in 2024. Our properties operate at various price and service points, allowing us to host a variety of casino guests, who are visiting our properties for gaming and other casino entertainment options, and non-casino guests who are visiting our properties for other purposes, such as vacation travel or conventions. 
Management and Branding Arrangements
We earn revenue from fees paid for the management of other hotels and casinos in North America. Managed properties represent Caesars-branded properties where we provide certain staffing and management services under management agreements. In addition, we authorize the use of certain brands and marks of Caesars Entertainment, Inc. from which we earn revenue from fees received based on the arrangements.
Entertainment and Other Non-Gaming Operations
We provide a variety of retail and entertainment offerings at our properties. We operate various entertainment venues across the United States, including the Colosseum at Caesars Palace Las Vegas and PH Live at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino. These award-winning entertainment venues host or have announced plans to host, prominent headliners such as Garth Brooks, The Killers, Rod Stewart, Jerry Seinfeld, Kelly Clarkson, Shania Twain, Scorpions and Blake Shelton.
On December 12, 2024, we sold the LINQ Promenade, which is an open-air dining, entertainment, and retail development located between The LINQ Hotel & Casino and Flamingo Las Vegas. The retail stores offer guests a wide range of options from high-end brands and accessories to souvenirs and decorative items. We continue to operate the High Roller, a 550-foot observation wheel, and Fly LINQ, the first and only zipline on the Las Vegas Strip located between the LINQ Hotel & Casino and Flamingo Las Vegas.
CAESARS FORUM is a 550,000 square-foot state-of-the-art conference center located at the center of the Las Vegas Strip. CAESARS FORUM can accommodate more than 10,000 participants and features more than 300,000 square feet of flexible meeting space, the two largest pillarless ballrooms in the world, a LEED silver-rated FORUM Plaza, and the first 100,000 square-foot outdoor meeting and event space in Las Vegas.

Market Activities
Trends
Economic Factors Impacting Discretionary Spending —
 Gaming and other leisure activities we offer represent discretionary expenditures which may be sensitive to economic downturns which impacts the behavior among the components of our customer mix differently.
We continue to monitor the effects of recent inflation and the possible implications on certain customers most affected by lower discretionary income. In addition, our leases with VICI are impacted by inflation as they are subject to annual escalators based on the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”). 
We are also continuing to monitor interest rates which have a direct impact on certain of our debt instruments, in addition to an effect on consumer spending. We evaluate projected changes in interest rates when entering into borrowing arrangements and manage our mix of fixed versus variable debt accordingly.
We continue to manage the economic challenges affecting our industry and our Company that arise including labor shortages, higher labor costs, supply chain disruptions, increased costs of goods and services, among other impacts. Further discussion of the effects of these trends are described throughout this Form 10-K. The extent and duration of these trends is uncertain and may intensify.
Online Betting and Gaming — 
Online betting and gaming is a rapidly developing sector of the e-commerce industry and we believe the digital segment of the global betting and gaming industry will continue to grow in popularity and consumer confidence. The market for online betting platforms is being driven by the increased use of digital processes and growing bettor demand. We anticipate that the United States market will continue to have a strong and steady uptake in active wagers as state-by-state legislation in the United States continues to evolve resulting in new opportunities in the United States sports betting market. The extent and future effects of online betting and gaming on our casino properties is uncertain but we expect that our online betting and gaming offerings will be complementary to our overall brick-and-mortar casino business.
Competition
The casino entertainment business is highly competitive. The industry is composed of a diverse group of competitors that vary considerably in size and geographic diversity, quality of facilities and amenities available, marketing and growth strategies, and financial condition. In most regions, we compete directly with other casino facilities operating in the immediate and surrounding areas. There has been increased competition from openings of newly developed casinos and plans of development in certain regions, including new tribal expansions throughout the United States. In Las Vegas, our largest jurisdiction, there have been openings and proposals for other large scale gaming and non-gaming development projects by various other developers and local casino operators. In response to changing trends, Las Vegas operators have been focused on expanding their non-gaming offerings, including upgrades to hotel rooms, new food and beverage offerings, and new entertainment offerings. Our Las Vegas Strip hotels and casinos also compete, in part, with each other. 
In recent years, many casino operators, including us, have been reinvesting in existing facilities, developing or rebranding new casinos or complementary facilities, and acquiring established facilities. These reinvestment and expansion efforts combined with aggressive marketing strategies by us and many of our competitors have resulted in increased competition in many regions. As companies have completed new expansion projects, supply has grown at a faster pace than demand in some areas. The expansion of properties and entertainment venues into new jurisdictions also presents competitive pressures.
Our properties also compete with legalized gaming from casinos located on Native American tribal lands. While the competitive impact on operations in Las Vegas from the continued growth of Native American gaming establishments in California remains uncertain, the proliferation of gaming in California and other areas located in the same regions as our properties could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In some instances, particularly in the case of Native American casinos, our competitors pay lower taxes or no taxes. In addition, certain states have legalized, and others may legalize, casino gaming in specific areas, including metropolitan areas from which we traditionally attract customers. These factors create additional challenges for us in competing for customers and accessing cash flow or financing to fund improvements for our casino and entertainment products that enable us to remain competitive.
We also compete with other non-gaming resorts and vacation areas, various other entertainment businesses, and other forms of gaming, such as state lotteries, on-track and off-track wagering, video lottery terminals, and card parlors. Our non-gaming offerings also compete with other retail facilities, amusement attractions, food and beverage offerings, and entertainment venues. Internet gaming and sports betting may also create additional competition in certain jurisdictions that our brick-and-mortar properties are located.

We face significant competition in our online sports betting, online horse racing wagering and iGaming businesses in jurisdictions where we currently operate and those jurisdictions in which we wish to expand. We continue to face new forms of competition with the advancement of other mobile sports betting, daily fantasy sports, sweepstakes betting products and other products by operators in similar jurisdictions in which we operate, as well as operators which are unregulated and operate outside of the United States. Although we have experienced recent success in obtaining approval for sports betting and iGaming licenses in new jurisdictions, new state launches may require significant upfront investment and may not be successful. 
Resources Material to Business 
Rewards Programs
We believe Caesars Rewards enables us to compete more effectively and capture a larger share of our customers’ entertainment spending when they travel among regions or engage in online wagering and gaming versus that of a standalone property, which is core to our cross-market strategy.
Caesars Rewards members earn Reward Credits for qualifying gaming activities, including sports betting, online gaming and iGaming apps and wagering in the Caesars Sportsbook, Caesars Palace Online Casino, Horseshoe Online Casino, and Caesars Racebook apps. Members also earn Reward Credits for qualifying hotel, dining and retail spending at most Caesars Entertainment destinations in the United States and Canada. Additionally, Reward Credits are earned when members use their Caesars Rewards VISA credit card or make a purchase through a Caesars Rewards partner. Members can redeem their earned Reward Credits for those same experiences. 
Caesars Rewards is structured by member tier level (designated as Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Diamond Plus, Diamond Elite or Seven Stars) and member value. This structure allows a member to progressively access the full range of benefits available across our portfolio of destinations as they progress through tier levels. Caesars Rewards is designed to cultivate a gratifying and frictionless relationship with our customers, motivating members to enhance both their frequency of visits and expenditures. Additionally, member data is utilized in conjunction with diverse marketing promotions. This includes campaigns spanning direct mail, email, our websites, mobile devices, social media, and interactive slot machines.
Intellectual Property and Resources
We use a variety of trade names, service marks, trademarks, patents and copyrights in our operations and believe that we have the rights necessary to conduct our continuing operations. The development of intellectual property is part of our overall business strategy. We regard our intellectual property to be an important element of our success. We file applications for and obtain patents, trademarks and copyrights in the United States and foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. While our business as a whole is not substantially dependent on any one patent, trademark, or copyright, we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our business operations and technology through the use of patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secret laws. We also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements. Our United States patents have varying expiration dates. 
We have not applied for the registration of all of our trademarks, copyrights, proprietary technology, or other intellectual property rights, as the case may be, and may not be successful in obtaining all intellectual property rights for which we have applied. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, parties may infringe upon our intellectual property and use information that we regard as proprietary, and our rights may be invalidated or unenforceable. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights or intellectual property to as great of an extent as do the laws of the United States. In addition, others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property.
We own or have the right to use proprietary rights to a number of trademarks that we consider, along with the associated name recognition, to be valuable to our business, including Eldorado, Silver Legacy, Isle, Lady Luck, Tropicana, Circus Circus, Caesars, Flamingo, Harrah’s, Horseshoe, Paris, Planet Hollywood, Caesars Rewards, Caesars Sportsbook, and William Hill.
As of December 31, 2024, our Caesars Sportsbook app is powered by our Liberty platform. The Liberty platform resulted in a significant upgrade to our user interface and significant product upgrades including numerous pre-match and live markets, extensive odds and flexible limits, player props, and same-game parlays. Our Liberty platform also integrates customers with the Caesars Rewards loyalty program. In addition, we and NYRABets LLC, the official online wagering platform of the New York Racing Association, Inc., have launched the Caesars Racebook app in 22 jurisdictions. The Caesars Racebook app provides access for pari-mutuel wagering at over 300 racetracks around the world. Wagers placed can earn credits towards the Caesars Rewards loyalty program.

Industry Overview
See 
Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
 See also Exhibit 99.1, “Gaming and Regulatory Overview,” to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference. 
Seasonality
We believe that business at our regional properties outside of Las Vegas is subject to seasonality, including seasonality based on the weather in the region in which they operate and the travel habits of visitors. Business in our properties can also fluctuate due to specific holidays or other significant events, particularly when a holiday falls in a different quarter than the prior year, the timing of the WSOP tournament (with respect to our Las Vegas properties), city-wide conventions, large sporting events or concerts, or visits by our premium players. We also believe that any seasonality, holiday, or other significant event may affect our various properties or regions differently. We may also experience seasonality with retail and online sports betting which coincides with certain sporting events, as well as seasons of professional sports teams.
Gaming Licenses and Governmental Regulations
The gaming and racing industries are highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations. We are subject to extensive regulation under laws, rules and supervisory procedures. These laws, rules and regulations generally concern the responsibility, financial stability and characters of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interests in the gaming operations. If additional gaming regulations are adopted in a jurisdiction in which we operate, such regulations could impose restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us. From time to time, various proposals have been introduced in legislatures of jurisdictions in which we have operations that, if enacted, could adversely affect the tax, regulatory, operational or other aspects of the gaming industry and us. We do not know whether or when such legislation will be enacted. Gaming companies are currently subject to significant state and local taxes and fees in addition to normal federal and state corporate income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. Any material increase in these taxes or fees could adversely affect us.
Some jurisdictions, including those in which we are licensed, empower their regulators to investigate participation by licensees in gaming outside their jurisdiction and require access to periodic reports respecting those gaming activities. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions.
Under provisions of gaming laws in jurisdictions in which we have operations, and under our organizational documents, certain of our securities are subject to restriction on ownership which may be imposed by specified governmental authorities. The restrictions may require a holder of our securities to dispose of the securities or, if the holder refuses, or is unable to dispose of the securities, we may be required to repurchase the securities.
A more detailed description of the regulations to which we are subject is contained in Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Internal Revenue Service Regulations, Bank Secrecy Act & Anti-Money Laundering
The Internal Revenue Service requires operators of casinos and online sports betting apps located in the United States to file information returns for U.S. citizens, including names and addresses of winners for certain table games, keno, bingo, slot machine and retail and online sports betting winnings in excess of stipulated amounts. The Internal Revenue Service also requires operators to withhold taxes on some table games, keno, bingo, slot machine and retail and online sports betting winnings of nonresident aliens. We are unable to predict the extent to which these requirements, if extended, might impede or otherwise adversely affect operations of, and/or income from, other games.
Regulations adopted by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Treasury Department (“FINCEN”) requires the reporting of currency transactions in excess of $10,000 occurring within a gaming day, including identification of the patron by name and social security number. This reporting obligation began in May 1985 and may have resulted in the loss of gaming revenues to jurisdictions outside the United States which are exempt from the ambit of these regulations. In addition to currency transaction reporting requirements, suspicious financial activity is also required to be reported to FINCEN. 
Caesars maintains a comprehensive risk-based Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) and Anti-Money Laundering (“AML”) program. It includes strong governance and effective internal controls and procedures to comply with applicable BSA requirements, regulatory guidance, and any related laws, and to take measures to prevent its affiliated casinos from being used for money laundering or other criminal activity. Execution of the program is governed with reference to FINCEN’s guidance on the Culture of Compliance. Caesars’ internal AML Policy, Know Your Customer Policy and BSA Identification Policy outline the Caesars AML Program and set the minimum standards for the related procedures and internal controls of the Caesars casino affiliates. Certain employees are required to complete annual trainings related to company policies, including AML.

Other Laws and Regulations
Our businesses are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations in addition to gaming regulations. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, food service, smoking, environmental matters, employees and employment practices, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results.
The sale of alcoholic beverages is subject to licensing, control and regulation by applicable local regulatory agencies. All licenses are revocable and are not transferable. The agencies involved have full power to limit, condition, suspend or revoke any license, and any disciplinary action could, and revocation would, have a material adverse effect upon our operations.
We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results. See 
Item 1A, “Risk Factors,”
 for additional discussion.
Taxation
Gaming companies are typically subject to significant taxes and fees in addition to normal federal, state and local income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. We pay substantial taxes and fees with respect to our operations. From time to time, federal, state, local and provincial legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. It is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including but not limited to air quality, indoor air quality, water quality, bulk storage of regulated materials, and disposal of waste, including hazardous waste. Such laws and regulations can impose liability on potentially responsible parties (owner/operators of real property) to clean up, or contribute to the cost of cleaning up, sites at which regulated materials were disposed of or released. In addition to investigation and remediation liabilities that could arise under such laws and regulations, we could face personal injury, property damage, fines or other claims by third parties concerning environmental compliance, contamination or exposure to hazardous conditions. Environmental regulatory violations also include monetary penalties assessed by the jurisdictional regulatory agency and civil or criminal penalties for intentional negligence. Occasionally and under certain circumstances, we have investigated and remediated (or contributed to remediation costs) contamination located at or near our facilities. Examples included contamination related to underground storage tanks and groundwater contamination arising from prior uses of land on which certain facilities are located. In addition, we have and continue to contain, manage, and dispose of manure and wastewater generated by concentrated animal feeding operations due to our racetrack operations; manage, abate, or remove indoor air quality concerns such as mold, lead, or asbestos-containing materials; and manage operations within applicable environmental permitting requirements. Although we have incurred and expect to incur costs related to various environmental matters such as investigations, remediation, and management of hazardous materials or conditions known or discovered to exist at our properties, those costs have not had, and are not expected to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. However, such matters in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Climate Change
There has been an increasing focus of international, national, state, regional and local regulatory bodies on greenhouse gas (“GHG”), including carbon emissions, and climate change issues. Future regulation could impose stringent standards to substantially reduce GHG emissions. Legislation to regulate GHG emissions has periodically been introduced in the U.S. Congress. Some Administrations have taken steps to further regulate GHG emissions. Those reductions could be costly and difficult to implement or estimate.
Beyond financial and regulatory effects, the projected severe effects of climate change – such as property damage or supply chain issues stemming from extreme weather events – has already and may continue to directly affect our facilities and operations. We recognize the impacts of climate change and are engaged in long-term initiatives to identify, assess, and manage the risks and opportunities associated with climate change (see “Environmental Stewardship” below).

Reporting and Record-Keeping Requirements
We are required periodically to submit detailed financial and operating reports and furnish any other information about us and our subsidiaries that gaming authorities may require. We are required to maintain a current stock ledger that may be examined by gaming authorities at any time. If any securities are held in trust by an agent or by a nominee, the record holder may be required to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to gaming authorities. A failure to make such disclosure may be grounds for finding the record holder unsuitable. Gaming authorities may, and in certain jurisdictions do, require certificates for our securities to bear a legend indicating that the securities are subject to specified gaming laws.
Human Capital Management
We aim to provide a workplace that is engaging, empowering, inclusive and respectful for all employees (our “Team Members”), embracing a culture of openness, passion for service and recognition. Our ongoing investment in professional training and development, safety, health and wellbeing, and Team Member recognition linked to guest satisfaction and community engagement are all important drivers of our success in delivering strong business results and creating value. We have approximately 50,000 Team Members throughout our organization, excluding all tribal partnerships.
Labor Relations
Approximately 22,000, or 44% of our Team Members, are covered by collective bargaining agreements with certain of our subsidiaries. The majority of these employees in various job positions are covered by the following agreements:

Talent acquisition and retention are key priorities. We maintain a wide range of channels for recruiting, including outreach to academic institutions, trade training centers, culinary institutions and nonprofits that help us source a dynamic pool of candidates who represent the communities in which we operate across the United States. We are committed to supporting Team Members throughout their career with Caesars and providing opportunities to achieve their professional goals.
We strive to inspire our Team Members through our mission, vision and values, and our Code of Commitment (described below). To evaluate our Team Member experience and our retention efforts, we monitor several Team Member measures, such as turnover rates and Team Member satisfaction. We send out Team Member experience surveys to help us further understand the drivers of engagement and areas where we can improve. These surveys are completed on a regular basis alongside additional surveys targeted at specific events within a Team Member cycle such as new hire onboarding and exit inquiries.
Our compensation and benefits programs are designed to attract, retain and motivate our Team Members. In addition to competitive salaries and wages, we provide a variety of short-term, long-term and incentive-based compensation programs to reward performance relative to key metrics relevant to our business. We offer comprehensive benefit options including, but not limited to, retirement savings plans, health insurance coverage (including medical, mental health, dental, vision and pharmacy), parental leave, educational assistance, training opportunities, company-paid life insurance and a Team Member assistance program. 
We place utmost importance on creating a safe workplace for our Team Members, embedding procedures so that all our Team Members have the awareness, knowledge and tools to make safe working a habit.
We also maintain programs to help our Team Members improve their health and wellbeing. These programs strive to provide metrics to demonstrate improvements in health for participating Team Members and their covered family members. We continue to make enhancements to our offerings and wellbeing programs with a wide range of affordable options, mental health initiatives and onsite primary care clinics.

We remain focused on recruiting and retaining Team Members who represent the communities in which we operate and creating an inclusive environment where all Team Members and guests are welcome. We embrace the unique and dynamic perspectives of our workforce and are committed to providing a workplace where every individual feels valued and empowered to be their best. We are concluding our five-year workforce diversity goals established in 2020, continue to comply with demographic requirements as outlined by various regulators.
Corporate Social Responsibility
Caesars’ Board of Directors (the “Board”) and senior executives view corporate social responsibility (“CSR”) as an integral element in the way we do business, with the belief that being a good corporate citizen helps protect the Company against risk, contributes to improved performance and helps foster positive relationships with all those with whom we connect. The Board and our executive management are committed to being an industry leader in CSR. In 2024, the Board and our leadership continued to engage with our CEO-level external CSR Advisory Board composed of experts representing inclusion, social impact, sustainability, business strategy, academia and investors, and used their guidance to confirm our CSR priorities. These priorities are reflected in our 15th annual CSR report, published in 2024 in accordance with Global Reporting Initiative Standards.
CSR Committee of the Board 
Caesars’ Board has a CSR committee that defines the duties and responsibilities of the Board in supporting delivery of our corporate purpose and CSR strategy.
Code of Commitment
Caesars is committed to being a responsible corporate citizen and environmental steward through our CSR strategy, PEOPLE PLANET PLAY. This is reflected in our Code of Commitment which is our public pledge to our guests, Team Members, communities, business partners and all those we reach that we will honor the trust they have placed in us through ethical conduct and integrity. We commit to:
•
PEOPLE: Supporting the wellbeing of our Team Members, guests and local communities.
•
PLANET: Taking care of the world we all call home.
•
PLAY: Creating memorable experiences for our guests and leading responsible gaming practices in the industry.
PEOPLE PLANET PLAY Strategy
Our PEOPLE PLANET PLAY strategy defines how we meet the obligations of our Code of Commitment. PEOPLE PLANET PLAY establishes multi-year targets in key areas of impact, including science-based greenhouse gas emissions-reduction goals aligning with global best practices on climate change action. In 2022, we conducted a comprehensive CSR assessment to evaluate our assumptions. With the help of an external specialist, our assessment gathered input from internal and external stakeholders, reviewed multiple industry and environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) disclosures, standards and frameworks and yielded 21 material topics. Our materiality assessment is available on our website at www.investor.caesars.com within the ESG resource hub on our Corporate Social Responsibility page. We are in the process of reviewing and updating our materiality assessment.
Responsible Gaming
For more than thirty years, Caesars has maintained its Responsible Gaming (“RG”) program. We train tens of thousands of Team Members each year and a cohort of RG Ambassadors throughout our properties to identify guests in need of assistance and provide support. In recent years, Caesars has contributed to the National Center for Responsible Gaming, the National Council on Problem Gaming and other state programs to help advance responsible practices in the gaming industry. Caesars Digital also maintains responsible gaming programs tailored to each state in which it operates, participates in Caesars’ overarching Responsible Gaming program, and offers users in-application RG tools such as time on device restrictions and wagering limits. No customers under 21 years old are allowed to wager on any of our Caesars Sportsbook, Caesars Racebook and iGaming mobile apps.
Code of Ethics and Business Conduct
Caesars also maintains a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct (the “Code”) that includes standards designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote, amongst other standards, honest and ethical conduct and full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Table of Contents

Caesars’ Chief Legal Officer serves as the compliance officer of the Code and Caesars provides periodic training regarding the contents and importance of the Code.
Gaming Compliance Plan
Caesars also maintains an Amended and Restated Gaming Compliance Plan (the “Plan”), which is approved by various gaming regulators. The Plan is designed to implement procedures to enhance the likelihood that no activities of the Company or any affiliate of the Company will impugn the reputation and integrity of Caesars. The Plan also establishes a Compliance Committee that assists the Company in implementing its strict policy that its business be conducted with honesty and integrity, and in accordance with high moral, legal and ethical standards. Caesars’ Senior Vice President & Assistant General Counsel – Regulatory & Compliance serves as the Compliance Officer as defined by the Plan.
Environmental Stewardship
We take a proactive approach to environmental sustainability through our CodeGreen strategy established in 2007, striving to improve our performance across energy and GHG emissions efficiencies, reduction of water consumption and increasing diversion of waste from landfills. Caesars recognizes the impact climate change can play both on our business and the guests we serve. Identifying, assessing, and managing the risks and opportunities therefore plays a vital role in our long-term strategic thinking on climate and water, and how we approach our CSR goals. Our goals are based in science as part of our strategy to reduce our environmental impact. 
In 2024, we updated our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emission reduction goals to align with a 1.5-degree Celsius limit to global warming, measured against a 2019 base year. Our goals were established using an absolute contraction approach and align with published guidance from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We also reaffirmed our publicly stated goal to become carbon neutral by 2050 with interim absolute GHG emission reduction goal of 46.2% by 2030 measured against a 2019 base year. We have updated our inventory management plan to allow for ongoing management and reporting of Scope 1 and 2 emissions in accordance with industry standards and we have updated and restated our energy and GHG emissions data dating back to 2019. Between 2019 and 2023, Caesars delivered a reduction in absolute Scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions of 20.7%. In 2024 we also set an absolute reduction target for Scope 3 emissions of 37.5% by 2035 against a 2022 baseline.
To achieve our goals, we have taken initiatives such as pursuing renewable energy sources and low-carbon options, including on site solar developments. For example, we have contracts to purchase energy from solar covered parking canopies completed at two Atlantic City properties, we installed solar covered parking at Harrah’s Pompano Beach and the Harrah’s Atlantic City convention center solar rooftop project is expected to be completed by the end of 2025. We also entered into long-term purchase power agreements for solar energy in Nevada from an on-site rooftop development at our Caesars Forum that is expected to go online by the end of 2025 as well as an off-site, utility-scale project. Our long-term goals include a continued focus on energy efficiency and conservation as well as evaluating additional renewable energy supply opportunities for each of our properties.
We voluntarily participate in the CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), an international nonprofit that runs a global disclosure system for investors, companies, and regions to manage their environmental impacts. In 2024, Caesars scored a B for both water security and for climate change. 
We are engaged in extensive waste reduction efforts across our facilities, including recycling, food donation, and manure composting. In 2023, we estimated our total waste diversion from landfills at 44%.
Community Investment
Caesars contributes to our local communities to help them develop and prosper, through funding community projects, Team Member volunteering and cash donations from the Caesars Foundation, a private foundation funded from our operating income. In 2024, the Caesars Foundation contributed $3.4 million to communities across the United States. During 2024, our Team Members, including Team Members through our tribal partnerships volunteered over 93,000 hours through the HERO program.
