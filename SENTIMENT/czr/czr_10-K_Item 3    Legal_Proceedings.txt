On October 2, 2024, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a $500 million common stock repurchase program (the “2024 Share Repurchase Program”). Under the 2024 Share Repurchase Program, we may, from time to time, repurchase shares of common stock on the open market (either with or without a 10b5-1 plan) or through privately negotiated transactions. The 2024 Share Repurchase Program has no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. There is no minimum number of shares of common stock that we are required to repurchase under the 2024 Share Repurchase Program. All share repurchases under the 2024 Share Repurchase Program are retired upon repurchase. 
Stock Performance Graph
The graph depicted below compares the cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock with the cumulative total return on the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index (“S&P 500”) and the Dow Jones U.S. Gambling Total Stock Market Index (“Dow Jones U.S. Gambling”) for the period beginning on December 31, 2019 and ending on December 31, 2024. NASDAQ OMX furnished the data. The performance graph assumes a $100 investment in our stock and each of the two indices, respectively, on December 31, 2019, and that all dividends were reinvested. Stock price performance, presented for the period from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2024, is not necessarily indicative of future results.

Overview
We are a geographically diversified gaming and hospitality company that was founded in 1973 by the Carano family with the opening of the Eldorado Hotel Casino in Reno, Nevada. Beginning in 2005, we grew through a series of acquisitions, including the acquisition of MTR Gaming Group, Inc. in 2014, Isle of Capri Casinos, Inc. in 2017, Tropicana Entertainment, Inc. in 2018, Caesars Entertainment Corporation in 2020, and William Hill PLC
 in 2021. O
ur ticker symbol on the NASDAQ Stock Market is “CZR.”
We currently own, lease or manage an aggregate of 53 domestic properties in 18 states with approximately 51,400 slot machines, video lottery terminals and e-tables, approximately 2,800 table games and approximately 45,600 hotel rooms as of December 31, 2024. In addition, we have other properties in North America that are authorized to use the brands and marks of Caesars Entertainment, Inc. Our primary source of revenue is generated by our gaming operations, which includes retail and online sports betting and online gaming. Additionally, we utilize our hotels, restaurants, bars, entertainment, racing, retail shops and other services to attract customers to our properties. 
As of December 31, 2024, we owned 22 of our casinos and leased 24 casinos in the U.S. We lease 18 casinos from VICI Properties L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (“VICI”) pursuant to a regional lease, a Las Vegas lease and a Joliet lease (the “VICI Leases”). In addition, we lease six casinos from GLP Capital, L.P., the operating partnership of Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc. (“GLPI”), pursuant to a Master Lease (as amended, the “GLPI Master Lease”) and a Lumière lease (together with the GLPI Master Lease, the “GLPI Leases”). See descriptions below under the “GLPI Leases” and “VICI Leases.”

In addition to the divestitures above, the operations of Rio All-Suite Hotel & Casino (“Rio”) were assumed by the lessor on October 2, 2023, and we exited our management agreement with Caesars Dubai on November 16, 2023. See 
Item 8. F
inancial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 3
 for further discussion on these key transactions and any applicable gain (loss) or impairment charges recorded.
Investments and Partnerships
We have investments in unconsolidated affiliates accounted for under the equity method which are recorded in Investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates on the Balance Sheets.
Pompano Joint Venture
In April 2018, we entered into a joint venture with Cordish Companies (“Cordish”) to plan and develop a mixed-use entertainment and hospitality destination expected to be located on unused land adjacent to our Pompano property. As the managing member, Cordish will operate the business and manage the development, construction, financing, marketing, leasing, maintenance and day-to-day operation of the various phases of the project. Additionally, Cordish is responsible for the development of the master plan for the project with our input and will submit it for our review and approval. While we hold a 50% variable interest in the joint venture, we are not the primary beneficiary; as such the investment in the joint venture is accounted for using the equity method. We participate evenly with Cordish in the profits and losses of the joint venture, which are included in Transaction and other costs, net on our Statements of Operations.
During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded income related to the investment of $64 million, primarily due to the joint venture’s gain on the sale of land. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we received distributions of $39 million and recorded $11 million of income related to our investment due to the joint venture’s gain on the sale of a land parcel. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our investment in the joint venture was $119 million and $147 million, respectively, and is recorded in Investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates on the Balance Sheets.
Reportable Segments
Segment results in this MD&A are presented consistent with the way our management reviews operating results, assesses performance and makes decisions on a “significant market” basis. Management views each of the Company’s casinos as an operating segment. Operating segments are aggregated based on their similar economic characteristics, types of customers, types of services and products provided, and their management and reporting structure. Our principal operating activities occur in four reportable segments: (1) Las Vegas, (2) Regional, (3) Caesars Digital, and (4) Managed and Branded, in addition to Corporate and Other. See 
Item 2. “Properties”
 for listing of properties by segment.
Presentation of Financial Information
The financial information included in this Item 7 for the periods after the Company’s divestiture of various properties or assets, described above, is not fully comparable to the periods prior to the date of divestiture.
This MD&A is intended to provide information to assist in better understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. Our historical operating results may not be indicative of our future results of operations because of the factors described in the preceding paragraph and the changing competitive landscape in each of our markets, including changes in market and societal trends, increased competition, as well as by factors or trends discussed elsewhere herein. We recommend that you read this MD&A together with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Key Performance Metrics
Our primary source of revenue is generated by our gaming operations, which includes retail and online sports betting and online gaming. Additionally, we utilize our hotels, restaurants, bars, entertainment venues, retail shops, racing and other services to attract customers to our properties. Our operating results are highly dependent on the volume and quality of customers staying at, or visiting, our properties and using our sports betting, horse racing and iGaming applications.
Key performance metrics include volume indicators such as drop or handle, which refer to amounts wagered by our customers. The amount of volume we retain, which is not fully controllable by us, is recognized as casino revenues and is referred to as our win or hold. Slot win percentage is typically in the range of approximately 9% to 11% of slot handle for both the Las Vegas and Regional segments. Table games hold percentage is typically in the range of approximately 16% to 23% of table games drop in both the Las Vegas and Regional segments. Sports betting hold is typically in the range of 7% to 11% and iGaming hold typically ranges from 3% to 5%. In addition, hotel occupancy, which is the average percentage of available hotel rooms occupied during a period, is a key indicator for our hotel business in the Las Vegas segment. See 
“Results of Operations”
 section below. Complimentary and discounted rooms are treated as occupied rooms in our calculation of hotel occupancy. The key metrics we utilize to measure our profitability and performance are Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin.

Consolidated net revenues decreased for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the same prior year period, primarily due to the Regional segment being negatively impacted by competition associated with new casino resorts opening in some of our regional markets, construction disruption from renovation projects at certain of our properties, and inclement weather in several of our property locations during the first quarter of 2024. In addition, net revenues in our Las Vegas segment decreased due to the divestiture of Rio at the end of the third quarter of 2023, and lower table games volume and hold. These results were partially offset for the year ended December 31, 2024 by higher net revenues from our Caesars Digital segment due to a significant increase in iGaming handle coupled with improved iGaming hold and higher hold in sports betting. Furthermore, our Regional segment generated incremental revenues from the opening of our temporary gaming facilities at Caesars Virginia and Harrah’s Columbus Nebraska during the second quarter of 2023, followed by the permanent facilities of Harrah’s Columbus Nebraska in May 2024 and Caesars Virginia on December 17, 2024.

Casino expenses were flat for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the same prior year period, in connection with higher gaming taxes and software costs associated with increased revenues in our Caesars Digital segment, offset in part by lower gaming taxes associated with lower gaming revenues in our Las Vegas and Regional segments. We continue to strategically manage our marketing and advertising spend to reduce our casino expenses related to our Caesars Digital segment. 
Food and beverage expenses have increased mainly due to higher union and non-union wages in addition to increased employee head count in our Las Vegas segment associated with new food and beverage offerings. We continue to focus on labor efficiencies to manage increased labor costs.
General and administrative expenses include items such as information technology, facility maintenance, utilities, property and liability insurance, expenses for administrative departments such as accounting, compliance, purchasing, human resources, legal, internal audit, and property taxes. General and administrative expenses also include other marketing expenses indirectly related to our gaming and non-gaming operations. General and administrative expenses decreased for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the same prior year period, due to lower general advertising expenses and reduced rent expense related to the Rio which was divested at the end of the third quarter of 2023.
Corporate expenses include unallocated expenses such as payroll related expenses, stock-based compensation, professional fees, and other various expenses not directly related to the Company’s operations.
Impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2024 were recorded within our Regional segment as a result of a decrease in projected future cash flows at certain properties primarily due to localized competition. Impairment charges to a trademark were also recorded due to the performance of our smallest brand in the Las Vegas segment.
Depreciation and amortization expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the same prior year period primarily related to recently completed construction projects.
Transaction and other costs, net for the year ended December 31, 2024 primarily includes non-cash losses on the write down and disposal of assets, gains from the sales of the WSOP trademark and the LINQ Promenade, professional services for transaction and integration costs, various contract exit or termination costs, pre-opening costs in connection with new property openings and expansion projects at existing properties, and non-cash changes in equity method investments. Transaction and other costs, net for the year ended December 31, 2023 also includes net proceeds received in exchange for participation rights in a potential insurance recovery.

Interest expense, net increased for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the same prior year period primarily due to the annual CPI-based rent escalator and the variable rent adjustment associated with our VICI Leases. Interest expense associated with our debt instruments is also slightly higher due to our debt mix, partially offset by our continuing efforts to reduce outstanding debt. An increase in capitalized interest resulting from ongoing construction projects, including our new developments, has also offset the increase in total interest expense.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, loss on extinguishment of debt was primarily related to the prepayments of the CEI Senior Secured Notes due 2025 and the Caesars Resort Collection (“CRC”) Senior Secured Notes and the partial prepayments of the CEI Term Loan B and the CEI Senior Notes due 2027. For the year ended December 31, 2023, loss on extinguishment of debt was primarily related to the prepayments of the CRC Term Loan, the CRC Incremental Term Loan and the Baltimore Term Loan.
Other income for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily represents a change in estimate of our disputed claims liability.

The income tax provision was $87 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to an income tax benefit of $888 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The reported income tax expense in 2024 differed from the statutory income tax benefit primarily due to nondeductible goodwill impairments and write offs and nondeductible interest expense. The reported income tax benefit in 2023 differed from the statutory income tax benefit primarily due to the partial release of federal and state valuation allowances. During the second quarter of 2023, we reversed the valuation allowance related to certain deferred tax assets and recorded a one-time income tax benefit of $940 million, as we determined it was more likely than not that a portion of our federal and state deferred tax assets would be realized.

Prior year gaming volumes include Rio’s table games drop of $70 million and $111 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and slot handle of $342 million and $530 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Our Las Vegas segment’s net revenues, net income, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the same prior year period. Net revenues, net income and gaming volumes were negatively impacted by the divestiture of Rio at the end of the third quarter of 2023. Casino revenues also declined as a result of lower table games volume and hold. Entertainment revenues also declined due to the mix of headliner performances in the current year, as compared to prior year. These decreases were slightly offset by higher hotel and food and beverage revenues associated with improved hotel occupancy, higher room rates and new food and beverage offerings, excluding the impact of the Rio divestiture. Net income and Adjusted EBITDA in the Las Vegas segment for the year ended December 31, 2024 were also negatively impacted by higher operating costs associated with (a) higher union and non-union wages, (b) increased employee head count associated with new food and beverage offerings and (c) increased promotional costs associated with special events held over the Super Bowl weekend.
We recorded trademark impairment totaling $32 million due to the performance of our smallest brand in the Las Vegas segment for the year ended December 31, 2024.
Slot win percentage in the Las Vegas segment during the year ended December 31, 2024 was within our typical range.

Our Regional segment’s net revenues, net income (loss), Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased for year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the same prior year period, primarily due to the continued impact of competition associated with new casino resorts opening in some of our regional markets and construction disruption from renovation projects at certain of our properties. Additionally, inclement weather in several of our regional property locations negatively impacted visitor volume in the first quarter of 2024. The impact of these unfavorable factors was partially offset for the year ended December 31, 2024 by the incremental revenues attributable to Caesars Virginia and Harrah’s Columbus Nebraska that opened temporary facilities during the second quarter in 2023. The permanent facility of Harrah’s Columbus Nebraska opened in May 2024 following the closure of the temporary facility in March 2024. The permanent facility of Caesars Virginia opened in December 2024.
As a result of the aforementioned factors impacting certain of our properties in the Regional segment, we recorded impairments totaling $270 million during the year ended December 31, 2024.
Slot win percentage in the Regional segment during the year ended December 31, 2024 was within our typical range.

(b)
Caesars Digital generated an additional $979 million, $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion of sports betting handle for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which is not included in this table, for select wholly-owned and third-party operations for which Caesars Digital provides services and we receive all, or a share of, the net profits. Hold related to these operations was 9.3%, 10.4% and 11.0% for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Sports betting handle includes $41 million, $45 million and $50 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to horse racing and pari-mutuel wagers.
Caesars Digital reflects the operations for retail and online sports betting, iGaming, poker, and horse racing, which includes our Caesars Sportsbook, Caesars Racebook and iGaming mobile apps. 
Caesars Digital’s net revenues, net income (loss), Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margin improved significantly for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the same prior year period, primarily due to higher iGaming handle and iGaming hold coupled with improved sports betting hold. The increase was slightly offset by lower sports betting handle. iGaming handle and iGaming hold improved following the launch of Caesars Palace Online Casino in August 2023 and Horseshoe Online Casino app which initially launched in October 2024. Despite improved sports betting hold which reflects the benefit of the continued investment in our sports betting platform, hold remained at the lower end of our expected range primarily due to customer friendly sports betting outcomes in the fourth quarter of 2024.
As sports betting and online casinos expand through increased state or jurisdictional legalization, new product launches, and customer adoption, variations in hold percentages and increases in promotional and marketing expenses in highly competitive markets during promotional periods may negatively impact Caesars Digital’s net revenues, net income, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in comparison to current or prior periods.

We manage several properties and license rights to the use of our brands. These revenue agreements typically include reimbursement of certain costs that we incur directly. Such costs are primarily related to payroll costs incurred on behalf of the properties under management. The revenue related to these reimbursable management costs has a direct impact on our evaluation of Adjusted EBITDA margin which, when excluded, reflects margins typically realized from such agreements. The table below presents the amount included in net revenues and total operating expenses related to these reimbursable costs. In September 2023, we recorded $25 million of additional other revenue related to the termination of the Caesars Dubai management agreement, which has been excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.

Supplemental Unaudited Presentation of Consolidated Adjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) for the Years Ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
Adjusted EBITDA (described below), a non-GAAP financial measure, has been presented as a supplemental disclosure because it is a widely used measure of performance and basis for valuation of companies in our industry and we believe that this non-GAAP supplemental information will be helpful in understanding our ongoing operating results. Management has historically used Adjusted EBITDA when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of certain recurring and non-recurring items is necessary to provide a full understanding of our core operating results and as a means to evaluate period-to-period results. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income (loss) before interest income or interest expense net of interest capitalized, (benefit) provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, impairment charges, other (income) loss, net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, transaction costs associated with our acquisitions, developments, and divestitures, and non-cash changes in equity method investments. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes the expense associated with certain of our leases as these transactions were accounted for as financing obligations and the associated expense is included in interest expense. Adjusted EBITDA is not

a measure of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is unaudited and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) as an indicator of our operating performance. Uses of cash flows that are not reflected in Adjusted EBITDA include capital expenditures, interest payments, income taxes, debt principal repayments, and payments under our leases with affiliates of VICI Properties Inc. and GLPI, which can be significant. As a result, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity. Other companies that provide EBITDA information may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do. The definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be the same as the definitions used in any of our debt or lease agreements.
The following table summarizes our Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 in addition to reconciling net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA in accordance with GAAP (unaudited):

Other income for the year ended December 31, 2024 primarily represents a change in estimate of our disputed claims liability.
(c)
Impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2024 include impairments within our Regional segment as a result of a decrease in projected future cash flows at certain properties primarily due to localized competition and an impairment to a trademark due to the performance of our smallest brand in the Las Vegas segment. 
(d)
Transaction costs and other, net primarily includes non-cash losses on the write down and disposal of assets, gains from the sales of the WSOP trademark and the LINQ Promenade, insurance proceeds from property damage, professional services for transaction and integration costs, various contract exit or termination costs, pre-opening costs in connection with new property openings and expansion projects at existing properties, and non-cash changes in equity method investments. 
(e)
Adjustment for pre-disposition results of operations reflecting the subtraction of results of operations for Rio All-Suite Hotel & Casino and the LINQ Promenade prior to divestiture, for the relevant periods. See 
Item 7 - Overview
 above. Such figures are based on unaudited internal financial statements and have not been reviewed by our auditors for the periods presented. The additional financial information is included to enable the comparison of current results with results of prior periods.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We are a holding company, and our only significant assets are ownership interests in our subsidiaries. Our ability to fund our obligations depends on existing cash on hand, cash flows from our subsidiaries and our ability to raise capital. Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are existing cash on hand, cash flows from operations, availability of borrowings under our CEI Revolving Credit Facility and proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities. Our cash requirements may fluctuate significantly depending on our decisions with respect to business acquisitions or divestitures and strategic capital and marketing investments.

(a)
Revolver capacity includes $2.25 billion under the CEI Revolving Credit Facility, maturing in January 2028 (subject to a springing maturity in the event certain other long-term debt of Caesars is not extended or repaid), and $25 million under the CVA Revolving Credit Facility, maturing on April 26, 2029, less $40 million reserved for specific purposes.
(b)
Excludes approximately $105 million of additional borrowing available under the CVA Delayed Draw Term Loan.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, our operating activities generated operating cash inflows of $1.1 billion, as compared to operating cash inflows of $1.8 billion during the year ended December 31, 2023 due to changes in working capital, coupled with the results of operations described above.
On February 6, 2024, we entered into an Incremental Assumption Agreement No. 3 pursuant to which we incurred a new senior secured incremental term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $2.9 billion (the “CEI Term Loan B-1”) under the CEI Credit Agreement. The CEI Term Loan B-1 requires quarterly principal payments in amounts equal to 0.25% of the original aggregate principal amount of the CEI Term Loan B-1, with the balance payable at maturity. Borrowings under the CEI Term Loan B-1, as amended in November 2024 described below, bear interest, paid at least quarterly, at a rate equal to, at our option, either (a) a forward-looking term rate based on the Term SOFR, subject to a floor of 0.50% or (b) a base rate (the “TLB-1 Base Rate”) determined by reference to the highest of (i) the “Prime Rate” in the United States, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% per annum and (iii) the one-month Term SOFR plus 1.00% per annum, in each case, plus an applicable margin. Such applicable margin is 2.25% per annum in the case of any Term SOFR loan and 1.25% per annum in the case of any TLB-1 Base Rate loan. The CEI Term Loan B-1 was issued at a price of 99.75% of the principal amount and will mature on February 6, 2031. 
Additionally, on February 6, 2024, we issued $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of 6.50% senior secured notes due 2032 (the “CEI Senior Secured Notes due 2032”) pursuant to an indenture by and among the Company, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto, U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee, and U.S. Bank National Association, as collateral agent. The CEI Senior Secured Notes due 2032 rank equally with all existing and future first-priority lien obligations of the Company and the subsidiary guarantors. The CEI Senior Secured Notes due 2032 will mature on February 15, 2032, with interest payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year.
The net proceeds from the issuance of the CEI Senior Secured Notes due 
2032 and the net proceeds from the CEI Term Loan B-1, together with borrowings under the CEI Revolving Credit Facility, were used to tender, redeem, repurchase, defease, and/or satisfy and discharge any and all of the principal amounts, including accrued and unpaid interest, related expenses and fees of both the 5.75% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 (the “CRC Senior Secured Notes”) and the 6.25% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 (the “CEI Senior Secured Notes due 2025”). As a result of these transactions, we recognized $48 million of loss on early extinguishment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2024.

On October 17, 2024, we issued $1.1 billion in aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Senior Notes due 2032 (the “CEI Senior Notes due 2032”) pursuant to an indenture dated as of October 17, 2024, by and among the Company, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto, and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee.

The CEI Senior Notes due 2032 will mature on October 15, 2032, with interest payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing April 15, 2025.
The net proceeds from the issuance of the CEI Senior Notes due 2032 were used to redeem approximately $1.1 billion of the principal amount, including accrued and unpaid interest, related expenses and fees of the CEI Senior Notes due 2027.

As of December 31, 2024, we have acquired 1,262,990 shares of common stock under the 2024 Share Repurchase Program at an aggregate value of $50 million, excluding any applicable excise taxes. See “Share Repurchase Program” below for details.
We expect that our primary capital requirements going forward will relate to the expansion and maintenance of our properties, taxes, servicing our outstanding indebtedness, and rent payments under our GLPI Leases and VICI Leases. We make capital expenditures and perform continuing refurbishment and maintenance at our properties to maintain our quality standards. Our capital expenditure requirements for 
2025
 include the completion of expansion projects, hotel renovations and continued investment into new markets with our Caesars Sportsbook and iGaming applications. In addition, we may, from time to time, seek to repurchase or prepay our outstanding indebtedness. Any such purchases or prepayments may be funded by existing cash balances or the incurrence of debt. The amount and timing of any repurchase of debt or common stock will be based on business and market conditions, capital availability, compliance with debt covenants and other considerations.
We have agreements with certain professional sports leagues and teams, sporting event facilities and media companies for tickets, suites, advertising, marketing, promotional and sponsorship opportunities including communication with partner customer databases. Some of the agreements provide us with exclusivity to access the aforementioned rights within the casino and/or sports betting category. As of December 31, 2024 and 
2023
, obligations related to these agreements were $421 million and $605 million, respectively, with contracts extending through 2040. These obligations include various third-party agreements which have been entered into by us for certain of our Las Vegas and Regional properties, or our Caesars Digital segment. The agreements include leasing of event suites that are generally considered short term leases for which we do not record a right of use asset or lease liability. We recognize expenses in the period services are received in accordance with the various agreements. In addition, assets or liabilities may be recorded related to the timing of payments as required by the respective agreement.

On April 26, 2024, Caesars Virginia, LLC entered into a new five-year $425 million pro rata bank financing to fund the remaining capital expenditures associated with the permanent casino resort facility, which opened on December 17, 2024.
A significant portion of our liquidity needs are for debt service and payments associated with our leases. Our estimated debt service (including principal and interest) is approximately $899 million for 
2025
. We also lease certain real property assets from third parties, including VICI and GLPI. The VICI Leases are subject to annual escalations, that take effect in November of each year, based on the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”). In addition to the CPI escalator, November 2024 represents the beginning of the first lease year in which our VICI leases are also subject to a variable rent adjustment based on certain historical net revenues of our leased properties. The next such lease year with a variable rent adjustment begins November 2027. We estimate our lease payments to VICI and GLPI to be approximately $1.3 billion for 
2025
. 
We have periodically divested assets to raise capital or, in previous cases, to comply with conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions imposed by antitrust, gaming and other regulatory entities. 
If an agreed upon selling price for future divestitures does not exceed the carrying value of the assets, we may be required to record additional impairment charges in future periods which may be material.
On October 29, 2024, we entered into an agreement to sell the LINQ Promenade to a joint venture between TPG and Acadia for $275 million. On December 12, 2024, we closed the sale for $275 million, resulting in a gain of $34 million, which was recorded in Transaction and other costs, net in the Statements of Operations. The LINQ Promenade was reported within the Las Vegas segment. 
On August 1, 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the WSOP trademark to NSUS for $250 million in cash at closing and a $250 million notes receivable for total consideration of $500 million. On October 29, 2024, we closed the sale to NSUS, resulting in a gain of $317 million, which was recorded in Transaction and other costs, net in the Statements of Operations. The note receivable bears interest at market rate plus an applicable margin, which resets quarterly. Interest and principal are due quarterly through its maturity date of October 29, 2029. Concurrent with signing the sale agreement, we entered into licensing agreements with NSUS that allows us to continue our current operations within the United States, including the WSOP’s live tournament series in Las Vegas for the next 20 years. The WSOP trademark asset was previously reported within the Caesars Digital segment.
We
 expect that our current liquidity, including availability of borrowings under our committed credit facility and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations, capital requirements and service our outstanding indebtedness for the next twelve months and beyond.
