Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
We prepare our financial statements in conformity with GAAP. In preparing our financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements, giving regard to materiality. When more than one accounting principle, or method of its application, is generally accepted, we select the principle or method that we consider to be the most appropriate under specific circumstances. Application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties. Certain of our accounting policies, including those in connection with income taxes, goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, long-lived assets, allowance for doubtful accounts related to certain gaming receivables, self-insurance reserves, and litigation, claims and assessments require that we apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates.
We consider accounting estimates to be critical accounting policies when:
•
the estimates involve matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made; and
•
different estimates or changes to estimates could have a material impact on the reported financial position, changes in financial position, or results of operations.
Table of Contents
53
By their nature, these judgments and estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Our judgments and estimates are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts, observance of trends in the industry, information gathered from customer behavior, and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. Due to the inherent uncertainty involving judgments and estimates, actual results may differ from those estimates.
Our most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas:
Income Taxes
We and our subsidiaries file income tax returns with federal, state and foreign jurisdictions. Our income tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other tax authorities. Positions taken in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws and may not ultimately be accepted by the IRS or other tax authorities. See 
Note 14
 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the status and impact of examinations by tax authorities.
We record income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and as attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use existing deferred tax assets. During the second quarter of 2023, we evaluated our forecasted adjusted taxable income and objectively verifiable evidence and placed substantial weight on our 2022 and 2023 quarterly earnings, adjusted for non-recurring items, including the interest expense disallowed under current tax law. Accordingly, we determined it was more likely than not that a portion of the federal and state deferred tax assets will be realized and, as a result, during the second quarter of 2023, we reversed the valuation allowance related to these deferred tax assets and recorded an income tax benefit of $940 million. We are still carrying a valuation allowance on certain federal and state deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized in the future. We have assessed the changes to the valuation allowance, including realization of the disallowed interest expense deferred tax asset, using the integrated approach.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $52 million and $9.1 billion, respectively, and federal general business tax credit and research tax credit carryforwards of $89 million, which will expire on various dates as follows:

Under the applicable accounting standards, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The accounting standards also provide guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions.
Goodwill and Other Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets
Assessing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment is a process that requires significant judgment and involves detailed qualitative and quantitative business-specific analysis and many individual assumptions which fluctuate between assessments.
We determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit based on a combination of EBITDA, valuation multiples, and estimated future cash flows discounted at rates commensurate with the capital structure and cost of capital of comparable market participants, giving appropriate consideration to the prevailing borrowing rates within the casino industry in general. We also evaluate the aggregate fair value of all of our reporting units and other non-operating assets in comparison to our aggregate debt and equity market capitalization at the test date. EBITDA multiples and discounted cash flows are common measures used to value businesses in our industry.
Table of Contents
54
We determine the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets using either the relief from royalty method or the excess earnings method under the income approach or a replacement cost market approach. The determination of fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets requires management to make significant assumptions and estimates around the forecasts as well as the selection of discount rates and valuation multiples. Changes in these estimates could have a significant impact on the fair value of our reporting units, intangible assets and result in potential impairment.
Forecasts and the determination of appropriate discount rates and valuation multiples used to determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets involves significant assumptions and estimates. Assumptions include those used to assess effects of changes in the competitive environment, capital projects and new developments which may not be realized at the projected rate.
We completed our annual impairment tests as of October 1, 2024. As a result, we recognized impairment charges in our Regional and Las Vegas segments. Our Regional segment’s impairments were due to a decrease in projected future cash flows at certain regional properties primarily due to localized competition within certain markets. We identified six reporting units in the Regional segment with estimated fair values associated with trademarks, gaming rights and goodwill below their respective carrying values and recorded impairments. This resulted in trademark impairment of $15 million, gaming rights impairment of $73 million and goodwill impairment of $182 million within the segment. Impairment charges of $32 million to a trademark were also recorded due to the performance of our smallest brand in the Las Vegas segment. 
As of October 1, 2024, four reporting units in the Regional segment and one reporting unit in the Las Vegas segment with goodwill totaling $1.2 billion had fair values that did not significantly exceed their respective carrying values. In addition, we identified one trademark totaling $22 million in the Regional segment that did not significantly exceed its carrying value. The reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets with carrying values that do not significantly exceed their estimated fair values are primarily assets acquired in the Merger when our discount rate was approximately 9.5%. The discount rate used in our annual impairment testing as of October 1, 2024 was approximately 10.0%. To the extent gaming volumes deteriorate in the near future, discount rates increase significantly, or we do not meet our projected performance, we may recognize further impairments, and such impairments could be material. The discount rate represents the most sensitive input in our estimates and an increase of 1% to the discount rate would result in additional impairments of approximately $130 million on the assets that do not significantly exceed their carrying values. In addition, $1.0 billion of goodwill within our Regional segment and $462 million in our Las Vegas segment are associated with reporting units with zero or negative carrying values. See 
Note 5
 for additional information.
Long-Lived Assets
We have significant capital invested in our long-lived assets, and judgments are made in determining the estimated useful lives of assets, salvage values to be assigned to assets, and if or when an asset has been impaired. The accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recognized in our financial results and whether we have a gain or loss on the disposal of an asset. We assign lives to our assets based on our standard policy, which is established by management as representative of the useful life of each category of asset. We review the carrying value of our long-lived assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. The factors considered by management in performing this assessment include current operating results, trends and prospects, planned construction and renovation projects, as well as the effect of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic, legal, and regulatory factors. In estimating expected future cash flows for determining whether an asset is impaired, assets are grouped at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which, for most of our assets, is the individual property. See 
Note 4
 for additional information.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts - Gaming
We reserve an estimated amount for gaming receivables that may not be collected to reduce the Company’s receivables to their net carrying amount. Methodologies for estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts range from specific reserves to various percentages applied to aged receivables. Historical collection rates and reasonable forecasts are considered, as are customer relationships, in determining specific reserves to reflect current expected credit loss. As with many estimates, management must make judgments about potential actions by third parties in establishing and evaluating our reserves for allowance for doubtful accounts. As of December 31, 2024, a 5% increase or decrease to the allowance determined based on a percentage of aged receivables would change the reserve by approximately $15 million.
Self-Insurance Reserves
We are self-insured for various levels of general liability, employee medical insurance coverage and workers’ compensation coverage. Insurance claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims, as well as accruals of estimates for claims incurred but not yet reported. We utilize independent consultants to assist management in its determination 
Table of Contents
55
of estimated insurance liabilities. While the total cost of claims incurred depends on future developments, in managements’ opinion, recorded reserves are adequate to cover future claims payments. Self-insurance reserves for employee medical claims, workers’ compensations and general liability claims are included within Accrued other liabilities on the Balance Sheets.
The assumptions utilized by our actuaries are subject to significant uncertainty and if outcomes differ from these assumptions or events develop or progress in a negative manner, the Company could experience a material adverse effect and additional liabilities may be recorded in the future.
Litigation, Claims and Assessments
We utilize estimates for litigation, claims and assessments. These estimates are based on our knowledge and experience regarding current and past events, as well as assumptions about future events. If our assessment of such a matter should change, we may have to change the estimates, which may have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from variable rate long-term debt arrangements. We manage our interest rate risk by monitoring interest rates, including future projected rates, and adjusting our mix of fixed and variable rate borrowings.
Interest Rate Risk
As of December 31, 2024, the face value of long-term debt was $12.3 billion, including variable-rate long-term borrowings of $5.9 billion under the CEI Term Loans and the CVA Delayed Draw Term Loan. No amounts were outstanding under the CEI Revolving Credit Facility or the CVA Revolving Credit Facility. 
The table below provides information as of December 31, 2024 about our fixed rate and variable rate financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates, including the cash flows associated with amortization and average interest rates. Principal amounts are used to calculate the payments to be exchanged under the related agreements and average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve as of December 31, 2024 and should not be considered a predictor of actual future interest rates.

As of December 31, 2024, borrowings outstanding under our CEI credit agreement and the CVA Delayed Draw Term Loan were variable-rate borrowings. Assuming a 100 basis-point increase in Term SOFR, our annual interest cost would change by approximately $59 million based on gross amounts outstanding at December 31, 2024.
We do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Caesars Entertainment, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Caesars Entertainment, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 25, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Goodwill 
– 
Refer to Note 5 to the Financial Statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. The Company performs its impairment test by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying amount. The Company determines the established fair value of each reporting unit based on a combination of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”), valuation multiples, and estimated future cash flows discounted at rates commensurate with the capital structure and cost of capital of comparable market participants, considering the prevailing borrowing rates within the casino industry in general, and expected sales proceeds. The Company further evaluates the aggregate fair value of all reporting units and other non-operating assets in comparison to its aggregate debt and equity market capitalization at the test date.
The Company performed its annual impairment assessment as of October 1, 2024. The Company’s goodwill balance was $10,601 million as of December 31, 2024 of which: (1) $1.1 billion and $71 million was related to three reporting units in the Regional segment and one reporting unit in the Las Vegas segment, respectively, had estimated fair values that did not significantly exceed their carrying values.
Table of Contents
58
The determination of the Company’s reporting units’ fair value requires management to make significant assumptions and estimates around forecasts and the selection of discount rates. Therefore, our audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s forecasts required a higher degree of auditor judgement, increased level of audit effort, and use of more experienced audit professionals, as well as the involvement of valuation specialists. 
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to management’s forecasts and the selection of discount rates used by management to determine the fair value of the Company’s reporting units included the following, among others:
•
We tested the effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls over valuation inputs including management’s forecasts and the selection of discount rates.
•
We evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast by comparing management’s historical projections to actual performance.
•
We evaluated the reasonableness of the assumptions and estimates included in management’s forecasts by: 
◦
Comparing forecasts to information included in the Company’s communications to the Board of Directors, projected information in industry reports, and analyst reports for the Company and peer companies.
◦
Conducting inquiries with property management.
◦
Considering the impact of changes in the competitive, regulatory, and economic environment on management’s projections.
◦
Assessing the reasonableness of strategic plans incorporated by management into the projections.
◦
Evaluating management’s estimate and the impact of any related expansion of gaming activities by analyzing historical information.
•
With the assistance of our valuation specialists, we evaluated the discount rates selected by management by:
◦
Assessing the impact of the uncertainty in the forecasts on the discount rates, including testing the underlying market-based source information used in the selection of the discount rates and the mathematical accuracy of the discount rate calculations.
◦
Developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to discount rates selected by management.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Caesars Entertainment, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries which may be referred to as the “Company,” “CEI,” “Caesars,” “we,” “our,” “us,” or the “Registrant” within these financial statements.
We also refer to (i) our Consolidated Financial Statements as our “Financial Statements,” (ii) our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) as our “Statements of Operations,” (iii) our Consolidated Balance Sheets as our “Balance Sheets,” and (iv) our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as our “Statements of Cash Flows,” which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). References to numbered “Notes” refer to Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.
Note 1. 
Organization and Description of Business
Organization
The Company is a geographically diversified gaming and hospitality company that was founded in 1973 by the Carano family with the opening of the Eldorado Hotel Casino in Reno, Nevada. Beginning in 2005, the Company grew through a series of acquisitions, including the acquisition of MTR Gaming Group, Inc. in 2014, Isle of Capri Casinos, Inc. in 2017, Tropicana Entertainment, Inc. in 2018, Caesars Entertainment Corporation in 2020, and William Hill PLC in 2021. The Company’s ticker symbol on the NASDAQ Stock Market is “CZR”. 
Description of Business
The Company owns, leases, brands or manages an aggregate of 
53
 domestic properties in 
18
 states with approximately 
51,400
 slot machines, video lottery terminals and e-tables, approximately 
2,800
 table games and approximately 
45,600
 hotel rooms as of December 31, 2024. In addition, the Company has other properties in North America that are authorized to use the brands and marks of Caesars Entertainment, Inc., as well as other non-gaming properties. The Company’s primary source of revenue is generated by its gaming operations, which includes retail and online sports betting and online gaming. Additionally, the Company utilizes its hotels, restaurants, bars, entertainment, racing, retail shops and other services to attract customers to its properties.
The Company’s operations for retail and online sports betting, iGaming, horse racing and online poker are included under the Caesars Digital segment. The Company operates and conducts sports wagering across 
32
 jurisdictions in North America, 
26
 of which offer online sports betting, and operates iGaming in 
five
 jurisdictions in North America as of December 31, 2024. The Company operates the Caesars Sportsbook app, the Caesars Racebook app, the Caesars Palace Online Casino app and the new Horseshoe Online Casino app which initially launched in October 2024. The Company also expects to continue to grow its operations in the Caesars Digital segment as new jurisdictions legalize retail and online sports betting and iGaming.
The Company has divested certain properties and other assets, including non-core properties and divestitures required by regulatory agencies. See 
Note 3
 for a discussion of properties and assets recently sold and 
Note 16
 for segment information.
Note 2. 
Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies
Additional significant accounting policy disclosures are provided within the applicable Notes to the Financial Statements.
Basis of Presentation
Our Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management believes the accounting estimates are appropriate and reasonably determined. Actual amounts could materially differ from those estimates.
The presentation of financial information herein for the periods after the Company’s acquisitions or before divestitures of various properties is not fully comparable to the periods prior to their respective purchase or after the sale dates. See 
Note 3
 for properties recently divested.
Our Financial Statements include the accounts of Caesars Entertainment, Inc. and its subsidiaries after elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions.
Table of Contents

CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
Consolidation of Subsidiaries and Variable Interest Entities
We consolidate all subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest and variable interest entities (“VIEs”) for which we or one of our consolidated subsidiaries is the primary beneficiary. Control generally equates to ownership percentage, whereby (i) affiliates that are more than 50% owned are consolidated; (ii) investments in affiliates of 50% or less but greater than 20% are generally accounted for using the equity method where we have determined that we have significant influence over the entities; and (iii) investments in affiliates of 20% or less are generally accounted for as investments in equity securities.
We consider ourselves the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have both the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the results of the VIE and the right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could be potentially significant to the VIE. We review investments for VIE consideration if a reconsideration event occurs to determine if the investment qualifies, or continues to qualify, as a VIE. If we determine an investment qualifies, or no longer qualifies, as a VIE, there may be a material effect to our Financial Statements.
Fair Value Measurements
The Company measures certain of its financial assets and liabilities at fair value, on a recurring basis, which is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Levels of the hierarchy prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value and include:
•
Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets.
•
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable.
•
Level 3: Unobservable inputs that reflect the Company’s own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents include investments in money market funds that can be redeemed immediately at the current net asset value per share. A money market fund is a mutual fund whose investments are primarily in short-term debt securities designed to maximize current income with liquidity and capital preservation, usually maintaining per share net asset value at a constant amount, such as one dollar. The carrying amounts approximate the fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments (Level 1). Cash and cash equivalents also include cash maintained for gaming operations.
Restricted Cash
Restricted cash includes cash equivalents held in certificates of deposit accounts or money market type funds, that are not subject to remeasurement on a recurring basis, which are restricted under certain operating agreements or restricted for future capital expenditures in the normal course of business.
Marketable Securities 
Marketable securities consist primarily of trading securities held by the Company’s deferred compensation plans. The estimated fair values of the Company’s marketable securities are determined on an individual asset basis based upon quoted prices of identical assets available in active markets (Level 1) and represent the amounts the Company would expect to receive if the Company sold these marketable securities.
 As of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company held $
2
 million in Level 1 securities.
Derivative Instruments
The Company may enter into derivative instruments to hedge the risk of fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates or pricing for other commodities. These agreements are designated as cash flow hedges.
 As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not hold any cash flow hedges or any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash. The Company has bank deposits that may at times exceed federally insured limits. Management believes all financial institutions holding its cash are of high credit quality and does not believe the Company is subject to unusual credit risk beyond the normal credit risk associated with commercial banking relationships.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
Pronouncements Implemented in 2024
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, “
Segment Reporting: Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures,
” which requires public entities to disclose information about their reportable segments’ significant expenses on an interim and annual basis. This guidance is effective for years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within years beginning after December 15, 2024. Amendments in this update should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has implemented the updated amendments included in ASU 2023-07. See 
Note 16
 for additional reportable segment disclosures.
Pronouncements to Be Implemented in Future Periods
In November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2024-03, “
Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures
,” which requires additional disclosure about specific expense categories in the notes to financial statements. This information is generally not presented in the financial statements today. This update applies to all public business entities and will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the amendments in this update to have a material impact on our Financial Statements.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “
Income Taxes: Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures,
” which requires disaggregated information about an entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. These updates apply to all entities subject to income taxes and will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. Updates will be applied on a prospective basis with the option to apply the standard retrospectively. We do not expect the amendments in this update to have a material impact on our Financial Statements.
In October 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06, “
Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments In Response to the SEC’s Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative,”
 to clarify or improve disclosure and presentation requirements on a variety of topics and align the requirements in the FASB accounting standard codification with the Securities and Exchange Commission regulations. This guidance is effective for the Company no later than June 30, 2027. We do not expect the amendments in this update to have a material impact on our Financial Statements.
Note 3. 
Divestitures and Discontinued Operations
The Company periodically divests assets that it may not consider core to its business to raise capital or, in some cases, to comply with conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions imposed by antitrust, gaming and other regulatory entities. The carrying value of assets that meet the criteria for assets held for sale are compared to the expected selling price and any expected losses are recorded immediately. Gains or losses associated with the disposal of assets held for sale are recorded within operating income, unless the assets represent a discontinued operation.

On October 29, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to sell the LINQ Promenade to a joint venture between TPG Real Estate (“TPG”) and the Investment Management Platform of Acadia Realty Trust (“Acadia”) for $
275
 million. On December 12, 2024, we closed the sale for $

WSOP Trademark Sale
On August 1, 2024, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the World Series of Poker (“WSOP”) trademark to NSUS Group Inc (“NSUS”) for $
250
 million in cash at closing and a $
250
 million note receivable for total consideration of $
500
 million. On October 29, 2024, the Company closed the sale to NSUS, resulting in a gain of $
317
 million, which was recorded in 
Transaction and other costs
, net in the Statements of Operations. The note receivable bears interest at market rate plus an applicable margin, which resets quarterly. Interest and principal are due quarterly through its maturity date of October 29, 2029. Concurrent with signing the sale agreement, the Company entered into licensing agreements with NSUS that allows the Company to continue its current operations within the United States, including the WSOP’s live tournament series in Las Vegas for the next 
20
 years. The WSOP trademark asset was previously reported within the Caesars Digital segment. See 
Note 5
 for further discussion on the trademarks associated with the sale.
Discontinued operations
On April 22, 2021 when the William Hill acquisition was consummated, the Company’s intent was to divest William Hill International. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities were classified as held for sale with operations presented within discontinued operations. On April 7, 2022, the Company amended the agreement to sell William Hill International to 888 Holdings Plc for a revised enterprise value of approximately £
2.0
 billion. On July 1, 2022, the Company completed the sale of William Hill International to 888 Holdings Plc. During the year ended December 31, 2022,
 the Company recorded impairments to assets held for sale of 
$
503

Note 4. 
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost, except for assets acquired in our business combinations which were adjusted for fair value under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805. Internal use software costs are capitalized during the application development stage. Costs of major improvements are capitalized, while costs of normal repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset as noted in the table below, or the term of the lease, whichever is less. Gains or losses on the disposal of property and equipment are included in operating income. 
Useful lives of each asset class are generally as follows:
Buildings and improvements
3
 to 
40
 years
Land improvements
12
 to 
40
 years
Furniture, fixtures and equipment
3
 to 
15
 years
Riverboats
30
 years
A portion of our property and equipment is subject to various operating leases for which we are the lessor. Leased property includes our hotel rooms, convention space and retail space through various short-term and long-term operating leases. See 
Note 7
 for further discussion of our leases.
The Company evaluates its property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. The Company compares the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment charge may be recorded for any difference between fair value and the carrying value. All recognized impairment losses are recorded as operating expenses, unless the assets represent a discontinued operation.
 See 
Note 3
 for further discussion of impairment on assets previously held for sale.

management. To the extent the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, such excess is recorded as goodwill.
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets must be reviewed for impairment at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. The Company performs its annual impairment tests as of October 1 of each fiscal year. The Company performs this assessment more frequently if impairment indicators exist. We utilized a combined income approach using a discounted cash flow method and a guideline public company method to determine the fair value of our goodwill. The Company performed the annual goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. The Company determines the estimated fair value of each reporting unit based on a combination of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), valuation multiples, and estimated future cash flows discounted at rates commensurate with the capital structure and cost of capital of comparable market participants, giving appropriate consideration to the prevailing borrowing rates within the casino industry in general, and expected sales proceeds. The Company also evaluates the aggregate fair value of all of its reporting units and other non-operating assets in comparison to its aggregate debt and equity market capitalization at the test date. EBITDA multiples and discounted cash flows are common measures used to value businesses in the industry.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of trademarks, Caesars Rewards and expenditures associated with obtaining racing and gaming licenses. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization but are subject to an annual impairment test. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess amount.
Trademarks and Caesars Rewards were valued using the relief from royalty method, which presumes that without ownership of such trademarks or loyalty program, the Company would have to make a stream of payments to a brand or franchise owner in return for the right to use their name or program. By virtue of this asset, the Company avoids any such payments and records the related intangible value of the Company’s ownership of the brand name or program.
Gaming rights represent intangible assets acquired from the purchase of a gaming entity located in a gaming jurisdiction where competition is limited, such as when only a limited number of gaming operators are allowed to operate in the jurisdiction. These gaming license rights are not subject to amortization as the Company has determined that they have indefinite useful lives. For gaming jurisdictions with high barriers of renewal of the gaming rights, such as material costs of renewal, the gaming rights are deemed to have a finite useful life and are amortized over the expected useful life. We used the Excess Earnings Method and a Cost Approach for estimating fair value for these gaming rights. 
Finite-lived intangible assets consist of trade names, customer relationships, reacquired rights, and technology acquired in business combinations. Amortization is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset. The Company evaluates for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. When indicators are noted, the Company then compares estimated future cash flows, undiscounted, to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is recorded. Impairment charges are presented on the Statements of Operations.
As a result of the finalized and approved capital and operating plans and the completion of impairment tests during the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized impairment charges in our Regional and Las Vegas segments. Our Regional segment’s impairments were due to a decrease in projected future cash flows at certain regional properties primarily due to localized competition within certain markets. The Company identified 
six
 reporting units in the Regional segment with estimated fair values associated with trademarks, gaming rights and goodwill below their respective carrying values and recorded impairments. This resulted in trademark impairment of $
15
 million, gaming rights impairment of $
73
 million and goodwill impairment of $
182
 million within the segment. Impairment charges of $
32
 million to a trademark were also recorded due to the performance of our smallest brand in the Las Vegas segment.
During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized impairment charges in our Regional segment. These impairments were primarily due to a decrease in projected future cash flows at certain regional properties due to increased competition. The Company identified 
one
 reporting unit with an estimated fair value of the associated gaming rights below the carrying value and recorded an impairment of $
81
 million. In addition, the Company identified 
one
 reporting unit with an estimated fair value below its carrying value and we recorded an impairment of $
14
 million to goodwill.
In December 2022, the Company recognized impairment charges in our Regional segment related to goodwill and gaming rights totaling $
78
 million and $
30
 million, respectively, due to an increase in the related discount rates, which represents the higher required cost of capital as a result of the macroeconomic environment and projected outlook.

Finance Leases
The Company has finance leases for certain equipment and real estate. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s finance leases had remaining lease terms of up to approximately 
34
 years, some of which include options to extend the lease terms in 
one month
 increments. The Company’s finance lease ROU assets and liabilities were $
60
 million and $
68
 million as of December 31, 2024, respectively, and $
69
 million and $
77
 million as of December 31, 2023, respectively.
Financing Obligations
VICI Leases & Golf Course Use Agreement
The fair value of the real estate assets and the related failed sale-leaseback financing obligations were estimated based on the present value of the estimated future lease payments over the lease term of 
15
 years, plus renewal options, using an imputed discount rate of approximately 
11.01
%.
CEI leases certain real property assets from VICI under the following agreements: (i) for a portfolio of properties located throughout the United States (the “Regional Lease”), (ii) for Caesars Palace Las Vegas and Harrah’s Las Vegas (the “Las Vegas Lease”), and (iii) for Harrah’s Joliet (the “Joliet Lease”), (collectively, “VICI Leases”). The lease agreements, inclusive of all amendments, include (i) a 
15-year
 initial term with 
four

five-year
 renewal options, (ii) initial annual fixed rent payments of $
1.1
 billion, subject to annual escalation provisions based on the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”) and a 
2
% floor which commenced in lease year 
two
 of the initial terms and (iii) a variable element based on net revenues of the underlying leased properties, commencing in lease year 
eight
 of the initial term. 
The Put-Call Right Agreement whereby the Company could have required VICI to purchase and lease back (as lessor) or whereby VICI could have required the Company to sell to VICI and lease back (as lessee) the real estate components of the gaming and racetrack facilities of Harrah’s Hoosier Park Racing & Casino and Horseshoe Indianapolis (the “Centaur properties”) was not exercised by either party prior to the December 31, 2024 expiration. 
The Golf Course Use Agreement between the Company and VICI has a 
35-year
 term (inclusive of all renewal periods), whereby the Company agrees to pay initial annual membership and use fees totaling $
14
 million, subject to annual escalation provisions similar to those described above in the Regional Lease, as well as certain per-round fees set forth in the agreement. 
GLPI Leases
The fair value of the real estate assets and the related failed sale-leaseback financing obligations were estimated based on the present value of the estimated future lease payments over the lease term of 
20
 years, plus renewal options, using an imputed discount rate of approximately 
9.75
%.
CEI leases certain real property assets from GLPI under the Master Lease (as amended, the “GLPI Master Lease”). The GLPI Master Lease, encompassing a portfolio of properties within the United States, provides for the lease of land, buildings, structures and other improvements on the land, easements and similar appurtenances to the land and improvements relating to the operation of the leased properties. The GLPI Master Lease, inclusive of all amendments, provides for (i) an initial term of 
20
 years (through September 2038), (ii) 
four

five-year
 renewals at the Company’s option, (iii) annual land and building base rent of $
24
 million and $
63
 million, respectively, (iv) escalating provisions of building base rent equal to 
101.25
% of the rent for the preceding year for lease years 
five
 and 
six
, 
101.75
% for lease years 
seven
 and 
eight
 and 
102
% for each lease year thereafter and (v) relief from the operating, capital expenditure and financial covenants in the event of involuntary closures.
CEI also leases the real estate underlying Horseshoe St. Louis from GLPI, (the “Lumière Lease”). The Lumière Lease, inclusive of all amendments, provides for (i) an initial term commencing on September 29, 2020 and ending on October 31, 2033, (ii) 
four

five-year
 renewal options, (iii) annual rent payments of $
23
 million, (iv) escalation provisions commencing in lease year 
two
 equal to 
101.25
% of the rent for the preceding year for lease years 
two
 through 
five
, 
101.75
% for lease years 
six
 and 
seven
 and 
102
% for each lease year thereafter, and (v) certain relief under the financial covenant in the event of involuntary closures. 
The Company continues to reflect the real estate assets related to the failed sale-lease back transactions on the Balance Sheets in Property and equipment, net as if the Company was the legal owner, and continues to recognize depreciation expense over their estimated useful lives.

____________________
(a)
For the initial periods of the VICI and GLPI Leases, cash payments are less than the interest expense recognized, which causes the failed-sale leaseback obligation to increase during the initial years of the lease term.
Lease Covenants
The GLPI Leases and VICI Leases contain certain covenants requiring minimum capital expenditures based on a percentage of net revenues along with maintaining certain financial ratios. The GLPI Leases require the Company to maintain a minimum adjusted revenue to rent ratio of 
1.20
:1.
The Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants as of December 31, 2024.
Lessor Arrangements
Lodging Arrangements
Lodging arrangements are considered short-term and generally consist of lease and nonlease components. The lease component is the predominant component of the arrangement and consists of the fees charged for lodging. The nonlease components primarily consist of resort fees and other miscellaneous items. As the timing and pattern of transfer of both the lease and nonlease components are over the course of the lease term, we have elected to combine the revenue generated from lease and nonlease components into a single lease component based on the predominant component in the arrangement. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized $
2.0
 billion, $
2.1
 billion and $
2.0
 billion, respectively, in lease revenue related to lodging arrangements, which is included in Hotel revenues in the Statements of Operations.
Conventions
Convention arrangements are considered short-term and generally consist of lease and nonlease components. The lease component is the predominant component of the arrangement and consists of fees charged for the use of meeting space. The nonlease components primarily consist of food and beverage and audio/visual services. Revenue from conventions is primarily included in Food and beverage revenue in the Statement of Operations, and during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, lease revenue related to conventions was $
51
 million, $
40
 million and $
34
 million, respectively.

Real Estate Operating Leases
We enter into long-term real estate leasing arrangements with third party lessees at our properties. As of December 31, 2024, the remaining terms of these operating leases ranged from 
1
 to 
81
 years, some of which include options to extend the lease term for up to 
five years
. In addition to minimum rental commitments, certain of our operating leases provide for contingent payments including contingent rentals based on a percentage of revenues in excess of specified amounts and reimbursements for common area maintenance and utilities charges. As the timing and pattern of transfer of both the lease and nonlease components are over the course of the lease term, we have elected to combine the revenue generated from lease and nonlease components into a single lease component based on the predominant component in the arrangement. In addition, to maintain the value of our leased assets, certain leases include specific maintenance requirements of the lessees or maintenance is performed by the Company on behalf of the lessees. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized $
148

Litigation, Commitments and Contingencies
Litigation
General
We are a party to various legal proceedings, which have arisen in the normal course of our business. Such proceedings can be costly, time consuming, unpredictable and, therefore, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of such proceedings will not materially impact our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Estimated losses are accrued for these proceedings when the loss is probable and can be estimated. While we maintain insurance coverage that we believe is adequate to mitigate the risks of such proceedings, no assurance can be given that the amount or scope of existing insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover losses arising from such matters. The current liability for the estimated losses associated with these proceedings is not material to our consolidated financial condition and those estimated losses are not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations.
Cybersecurity Incident
On September 14, 2023, we announced that an unauthorized actor had gained access to our information technology network as a result of a social engineering attack on an outsourced IT support vendor used by the Company, and acquired a copy of, among other data, our loyalty program database, which includes driver’s license numbers and/or social security numbers for a significant number of members in the database (“Data Incident”).
As a result of the Data Incident, numerous putative class action lawsuits have been filed against us purporting to represent various classes of persons whose personal information was affected by the Data Incident. These putative class actions assert a variety of common law and statutory claims based on allegations that we failed to use reasonable security procedures and practices to safeguard customers’ personal information, and seek monetary and statutory damages, injunctive relief and other related relief. In addition to those putative class action lawsuits, individual claims have been filed or threatened against us as well.
In addition, we have received inquiries from numerous state regulators related to the Data Incident. We have responded or are in the process of responding to these inquiries and are cooperating fully with regulators.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
While we intend to vigorously defend ourselves in the above-described proceedings, we believe it is reasonably possible that we may incur losses associated therewith. It is not possible at this time to estimate the amount of loss or range of loss, if any, that might result from adverse judgments, settlements, or other resolution given the stage of these proceedings, the absence of specific allegations regarding the alleged damages, the uncertainty as to the certification of a class or classes and the size of any certified class, if applicable, and/or the lack of resolution of significant factual and legal issues. Moreover, additional lawsuits and claims related to the Data Incident may be asserted and governmental agencies may open additional inquiries or investigations into the Data Incident. We have received, and continue to pursue, reimbursements from insurance carriers for costs incurred as a result of the Data Incident. 
We have incurred, and may continue to incur, certain expenses related to the Data Incident, including expenses to respond to, remediate and investigate this matter. The full scope of the costs and related impacts of this incident, including the extent to which these costs will be offset by our cybersecurity insurance or potential indemnification claims against third parties, has not been determined. We are unable to predict the full impact of this incident and its impact on guest behavior in the future, including whether a change in our guests’ behavior could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations on an ongoing basis. Based on our assessment, the incident has not had a material impact, and we do not believe the incident has materially affected or will materially affect us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.

Revenue Recognition
Accounting Policies
Casino Revenues
Our casino revenues consist of gaming wagers, pari-mutuel commissions, sports betting and iGaming wagers. Casino revenue represents the Company’s net win from these gaming activities, which is the difference between gaming wins and losses, not the total amount wagered. Progressive jackpots are accrued and charged to revenue at the time the obligation to pay the jackpot is established. Gaming revenues are recognized net of free bets, free play, matched deposits, and other similar incentives to its customers. During significant promotional periods, such as entering new jurisdictions with our Caesars Sportsbook or Caesars Racebook apps, such activity could result in negative net gaming revenue. Such periods are not long in duration as our level of investment during these promotional periods is within our discretion. Pari-mutuel commissions consist of commissions earned from thoroughbred and harness racing and importing of simulcast signals from other racetracks and are recognized at the time wagers are made. Such commissions are a designated portion of the wagering handle as determined by state racing commissions and are shown net of the taxes assessed by state and local agencies, as well as purses and other contractual amounts paid to horsemen associations. The Company recognizes revenues from fees earned through the exporting of simulcast signals to other racetracks at the time wagers are made, which are recorded on a gross basis. Such fees are based upon a predetermined percentage of handle as contracted with the other racetracks.
Non-gaming Revenues
Hotel, food and beverage, and other operating revenues are recognized as services are performed and is the net amount collected from the customer for such goods and services. Hotel, food and beverage services have been determined to be separate, stand-alone performance obligations and are recorded as revenue as the good or service is transferred to the customer over the customer’s stay at the hotel or when the delivery is made for the food and beverage. Advance deposits for future hotel occupancy, convention space or food and beverage services contracts are recorded as deferred income until revenue recognition criteria has been met. The Company also provides goods and services that may include multiple performance obligations, such as for packages, for which revenues are allocated on a pro rata basis based on each service’s standalone selling price (“SSP”).
Sales and other taxes collected from customers on behalf of governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and are not included in net revenues or operating expenses.
The Company’s Statements of Operations presents net revenue disaggregated by type or nature of the good or service. A summary of net revenues disaggregated by type of revenue and reportable segment is presented below. Refer to

Accounts Receivable and Credit Risk

We issue credit to approved casino customers following investigations of creditworthiness. Business or economic conditions or other significant events could affect the collectability of these receivables. Accounts receivable are non-interest bearing and are initially recorded at cost. 
Marker play represents a meaningful portion of our overall table games volume. We maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely. These collection efforts include the mailing of statements and delinquency notices and the use of personal contacts, outside collection agencies and civil litigation. Markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the United States. Markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries, but the United States assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the United States. We consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability, among other factors, when we issue credit to customers who are not residents of the United States.
Trade receivables, including casino and hotel receivables, are typically non-interest bearing. Accounts are written off when management deems the account to be uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts previously written off are recorded when received. Management believes that as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
no
 significant concentrations of credit risk related to receivables existed.
Reserve for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable
An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained to reduce the Company’s receivables to their carrying amount, which approximates fair value. The allowance is estimated based on specific review of customer accounts, historical collection experience, customer relationships and reasonable forecasts which consider current economic and business conditions to reflect current expected credit loss. As with many estimates, management must make judgments about potential actions by third parties in establishing and evaluating our reserves for bad debts.

Contract and Contract Related Liabilities
The Company records contract or contract related liabilities related to differences between the timing of cash receipts from the customer and the recognition of revenue. The Company generally has three types of liabilities related to contracts with customers: (1) outstanding chip liability, which represents the amounts owed in exchange for gaming chips held by customers,(2) Caesars Rewards player loyalty program obligations, which represent the deferred allocation of revenue relating to reward credits granted to Caesars Rewards members based on certain types of customer spend, including online and retail gaming, hotel, dining, retail shopping, and player loyalty program incentives earned, and (3) customer deposits and other deferred revenue, which primarily represents funds deposited by customers related to gaming play and advance payments received for goods and services yet to be provided (such as advance ticket sales, deposits on rooms and convention space, unpaid wagers, iGaming deposits, or future sports bets). These liabilities are generally expected to be recognized as revenue within one year of being purchased, earned, or deposited and are recorded within accrued other liabilities on the Company’s Balance Sheets. Liabilities expected to be recognized as revenue beyond one year of being purchased, earned, or deposited are recorded within other long-term liabilities on the Company’s Balance Sheets.
Outstanding Chip Liability
The Company recognizes the impact on gaming revenues on an annual basis to reflect an estimate of the change in the value of outstanding chips that are not expected to be redeemed. This estimate is determined by measuring the difference between the total value of chips placed in service less the value of chips under our control. This measurement is performed on an annual basis utilizing a methodology in which a consistent formula is applied to estimate the percentage of chips not in our custody that are not expected to be redeemed. In addition to the formula, certain judgments are made with regard to various denominations and souvenir chips. The outstanding chip liability is included in accrued other liabilities on the Balance Sheets.
Caesars Rewards Loyalty Program
Caesars Rewards grants Reward Credits to Caesars Rewards Members based on various types of customer spend, including online and retail gaming, hotel, dining, and retail shopping at Caesars-affiliated properties. Members may redeem Reward Credits for complimentary or discounted goods and services such as rooms, food and beverages, merchandise, free play, entertainment, and travel accommodations. Members are able to accumulate Reward Credits over time that they may redeem at their discretion under the terms of the program. A member’s Reward Credit balance is forfeited if the member does not earn at least one Reward Credit during a continuous six-month period.
Because of the significance of the Caesars Rewards program and the ability for customers to accumulate Reward Credits based on their past play, we have determined that Reward Credits granted in conjunction with other earning activity represent a performance obligation. As a result, for transactions in which Reward Credits are earned, we allocate a portion of the transaction price to the Reward Credits that are earned based upon the relative SSP of the goods and services involved. When the activity underlying the “earning” of the Reward Credits has a wide range of selling prices and is highly variable, such as in the case of gaming activities, we use the residual approach in this allocation by computing the value of the Reward Credits as described below and allocating the residual amount to the gaming activity. This allocation results in a significant portion of the transaction price being deferred and is recognized as revenue when the Reward Credits are redeemed in accordance with the specific recognition policy of the activity for which the credits are redeemed. 
Our Caesars Rewards loyalty program includes various tiers that offer different benefits, and members are able to earn credits towards tier status, which generally enables them to receive discounts similar to those provided as complimentaries described below. We have determined that any such discounts received as a result of tier status do not represent material rights, and therefore, we do not account for them as distinct performance obligations.
We have determined the SSP of a Reward Credit by computing the redemption value of credits expected to be redeemed. Because Reward Credits are not otherwise independently sold, we analyzed all Reward Credit redemption activity over the preceding calendar year and determined the redemption value based on the fair market value of the goods and services for which the Reward Credits were redeemed. We have applied the practical expedient under the portfolio approach to our Reward Credit transactions because of the similarity of gaming and other transactions and the homogeneity of Reward Credits.
As part of determining the SSP for Reward Credits, we also determined that there is generally an amount of Reward Credits that is not redeemed, which is considered “breakage.” We recognize the expected breakage proportionally with the pattern of revenue recognized related to the redemption of Reward Credits. We periodically reassess our customer behaviors and revise our expectations as deemed necessary on a prospective basis.

Customer deposits and other deferred revenues decreased in 2024 primarily due to a reduction in both advanced ticket sales and gaming deposits.
Complimentaries
The Company offers discretionary coupons and other discretionary complimentaries to customers outside of the loyalty program such as matching deposits, free bets and free play. Such complimentaries are provided in conjunction with other revenue‑earning activities and are generally provided to encourage additional customer spending on those activities. Accordingly, the Company allocates a portion of the transaction price received from such customers to the complimentary goods and services. The Company performs this allocation based on the SSP of the underlying goods and services, which is determined based upon the weighted-average cash sales prices received for similar services at similar points during the year. The retail value of complimentary food, beverage, hotel rooms and other services provided to customers is recognized as a reduction of revenues for the department which issued the complimentary and revenue for the department redeemed. Complimentaries provided by third parties at the discretion and under the control of the Company are recorded as an expense when incurred. 
The Company’s revenues included complimentaries and loyalty point redemptions totaling $
1.3
 billion, $
1.4
 billion and $
1.2
 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Note 11. 
Earnings per Share
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to Caesars by the weighted average shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted EPS is computed similarly to basic EPS except that the weighted average shares outstanding are increased to include additional shares from the assumed exercise of stock options and the assumed vesting of restricted share units, if dilutive. The number of additional shares is calculated by assuming that outstanding stock options were exercised, that outstanding restricted share units were released and that the proceeds from such activities were used to acquire shares of common stock at the average market price during the reporting period.
For a period in which the Company generated a net loss from continuing operations attributable to Caesars, the weighted average shares outstanding - basic was used in calculating diluted loss per share because using diluted shares would have been anti-dilutive to loss per share.

Stock-Based Compensation and Stockholders’ Equity
Stock-Based Awards
The Company maintains long-term incentive plans which allow for granting stock-based compensation awards of Company Common Stock to directors, employees, officers, and consultants or advisers who render services to the Company or its subsidiaries, including stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance stock units (“PSUs”), market-based performance stock units (“MSUs”), stock appreciation rights, and other stock-based awards or dividend equivalents. Forfeitures are recognized in the period in which they occur. 
Performance Incentive Plans
The Board of Directors (“Board”) adopted, and the Company’s stockholders approved, the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended and restated in 2019 (the “2015 Plan”), which allows for shares to be granted as part of the Company’s long-term incentive plan. On April 24, 2024, the Board approved an amendment to the 2015 Plan and the Company’s stockholders subsequently approved the adoption of the amended and restated 2015 Plan on June 11, 2024. The amendment to the 2015 Plan allows for, among other things, an increase in the number of shares available for future grants to 
8
 million shares, plus the number of shares available for issuance under the 2015 Plan on the date the Company’s stockholders approved the amendment. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately 
10
 million shares available for grant under the 2015 Plan. 
Equity awards granted to employees and executive officers generally vest within 
one
 to 
three years
 from the grant date either ratably on each anniversary, or entirely at the end of the service period. Awards may also contain performance conditions in addition to time based vesting conditions. Performance awards relate to the achievement of defined levels of performance and will vest and become payable at the end of the vesting period. Performance awards may contain targeted performance levels, which may ultimately vest within a range of 
0
% to 
200
% of the target award, based on defined operating metrics or market performance as compared to a peer group. RSUs granted to non-employee directors generally vest immediately and are issued on the vesting date, or may be deferred.

% of the granted MSUs in the form of Company Common Stock based on the achievement of specified market and service conditions. Based on the terms and conditions of the awards, the grant date fair value of the MSUs was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Key assumptions for the Monte Carlo simulation model are the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, expected dividends and correlation coefficient. The effect of market conditions is considered in determining the grant date fair value, which is not subsequently revised based on actual performance.

 active deferred compensation plans, the Caesars Entertainment Corporation Executive Supplemental Savings Plan III (“ESSP III”) and the Caesars Entertainment Corporation Outside Director Deferred Compensation Plan. These plans are unfunded, non-qualified deferred compensation plans. Payment obligations pursuant to the plans are unsecured general obligations of the Company and affiliates of the Company employing participants in the ESSP III. The liability as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $
6
 million and $
5
 million, respectively, which was recorded in Other long-term liabilities in the Balance Sheets. 
As of December 31, 2024, certain current and former employees of Caesars, and our subsidiaries and affiliates, have balances under: (i) the Harrah’s Entertainment, Inc. Executive Supplemental Savings Plan, (ii) the Harrah’s Entertainment, Inc. Executive Supplemental Savings Plan II, (iii) the Park Place Entertainment Corporation Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, (iv) the Harrah’s Entertainment, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan, and (v) the Harrah’s Entertainment, Inc. Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (collectively, the “existing deferred compensation plans”). These plans are deferred compensation plans that allowed certain employees an opportunity to save for retirement and other purposes. Each of the plans are now frozen and no longer accepting contributions. However, participants may still earn returns on existing plan balances based upon their selected investment alternatives, which are reflected in their deferral accounts. The total liability recorded in Other long-term liabilities in the Balance Sheets for these plans was $
30
 million and $
31
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Trust Assets
CEI is a party to a trust agreement (the “Trust Agreement”) and an escrow agreement with respect to all 
five
 of the existing deferred compensation plans (the “Escrow Agreement”), each structured as a so-called “rabbi trust” arrangement, which holds assets that may be used to satisfy obligations under the existing deferred compensation plans above. Amounts held pursuant to the Trust Agreement and the Escrow Agreement were $
53
 million and $
67
 million, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and have been reflected within Other long-term assets, net in the Balance Sheets. 
Multi-employer Pension Plans 
The Company contributes to a number of multi-employer defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective bargaining agreements that cover union-represented employees. The risks of participating in these multi-employer plans are different from a single-employer plan in the following respects:
i.
Assets contributed to the multi-employer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers.
ii.
If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers.
iii.
If the Company chooses to stop participating in some of its multi-employer plans, the Company may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunding of the plan, referred to as a “withdrawal liability.”

Represents the Pension Protection Act zone status for applicable plan year beginning January 1, except where noted otherwise. The zone status is based on information that the Company received from the plan administrator and is certified by the plan’s actuary. Among other factors, plans in the red zone are generally less than 65% funded, plans in the yellow zone are between 65% and less than 80% funded, and plans in the green zone are at least 80% funded. All plans detailed in the table above utilized extended amortization provisions to calculate zone status.
(b)
Indicates plans for which a financial improvement plan (“FIP”) or a rehabilitation plan (“RP”) is either pending or has been implemented.
(c)
The terms of the current agreement continue indefinitely until either party provides appropriate notice of intent to terminate the contract.
(d)
The Company provided more than 
5
% of the total contributions for the plan year ended December 31, 2023 and as of the date the financial statements were issued, Forms 5500 were not available for the 2024 plan year.
(e)
The HEREIU Pension Fund consists of two separate plans, the Legacy Plan of the HEREIU Pension Fund and the Adjustable Plan of the HEREIU Pension Fund. CEI makes a single contribution to the HEREIU Pension Fund, the Trustees of which allocate such contribution between the Legacy Plan and the Adjustable Plan. The contribution amount reflected to the Legacy Plan is the aggregate contribution made to the HEREIU Pension Fund before such allocation between the Legacy Plan and the Adjustable Plan of the HEREIU Pension Fund.

Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use existing deferred tax assets. During the second quarter of 2023, the Company evaluated its forecasted adjusted taxable income and objectively verifiable evidence and placed substantial weight on its 2022 and 2023 quarterly earnings, adjusted for non-recurring items, including the interest expense disallowed under current tax law. Accordingly, the Company determined it was more likely than not that a portion of the federal and state deferred tax assets will be realized and, as a result, during the second quarter of 2023, the Company reversed the valuation allowance related to these deferred tax assets and recorded an income tax benefit of $
940
 million. The Company is still carrying a valuation allowance on certain federal and state deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized in the future. The Company has assessed the changes to the valuation allowance, including realization of the disallowed interest expense deferred tax asset, using the integrated approach. 
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $
52
 million and $
9.1
 billion, respectively, and federal general business tax credit and research tax credit carryforwards of $
89
 million, which will expire on various dates as follows:

In general, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code provides an annual limitation with respect to the ability of a corporation to utilize its net operating loss carryovers, as well as certain built-in losses, against future taxable income in the event of a change in ownership. It is unlikely that the limitation will adversely affect the Company’s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryovers against its future taxable income.

We classify reserves for tax uncertainties within Other long-term liabilities in our Balance Sheets, separate from any related income tax payable, deferred tax asset, or deferred tax liability. Reserve amounts relate to any potential income tax liabilities resulting from uncertain tax positions as well as potential interest or penalties associated with those liabilities. 
We accrue interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. During 2024, we decreased our unrecognized tax benefits by $
8
 million, primarily due to a reduction in the Louisiana state tax rate due to a change in tax law. During 2023, we decreased our unrecognized tax benefits by $
4
 million, primarily due to the noncash settlement of a state audit. During 2022, we decreased our unrecognized tax benefits by $
29
 million, primarily due to the sale of William Hill International. There was an accrual for the payment of interest and penalties of $
1
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 
no
 accrual for the payment of interest and penalties as of December 31, 2023. Included in the balances of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $
106
 million and $
112
 million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. 
In 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (the “OECD”) established an Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting and agreed on a two-pillar solution (“Pillar Two”) to global taxation, focusing on global profit allocation and a 15% global minimum effective tax rate. The OECD issued Pillar Two model rules and continues to release guidance on these rules. While the US has not yet adopted the Pillar Two rules, various other countries around the world are enacting legislation. We will continue to analyze the law to determine potential impacts. We currently do not expect the Framework to have a material impact on our effective tax rate or our financial statements.
The Company, including its subsidiaries, files tax returns with federal, state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company does not have tax sharing agreements with the other members within the consolidated group. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to US federal or state and local tax assessments by tax authorities for years before 2021. We believe that it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits liability will not materially change within the next 12 months. Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. Although we believe that adequate provision has been made for such issues, there is the possibility that the ultimate resolution of such issues could have an adverse effect on our earnings. Conversely, if these issues are resolved favorably in the future, the related provision would be reduced, thus having a favorable impact on earnings.

Related Party and Affiliate Transactions
C. S. & Y. Associates
The Company owns the entire parcel on which Eldorado Resort Casino Reno is located, except for approximately 
30,000
 square feet which is leased from C. S. & Y. Associates (“CSY”) (the “CSY Lease”). CSY is a general partnership in which a trust has an approximate 
27
% interest. The Company’s Executive Chairman of the Board, Gary L. Carano, and his siblings are direct or indirect beneficiaries of the trust. The CSY Lease expires on June 30, 2057. Annual rent pursuant to the CSY Lease is currently $
0.6
 million, paid monthly. Annual rent is subject to periodic rent escalations of 
1
 to 
2
 percent through the term of the lease. Commensurate with its interest, the trust receives directly from the Company approximately 
27
% of the rent paid by the Company. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023 there were 
no
 amounts due to or from CSY.
CVA Holdco, LLC
In May 2023, the Company entered into a joint venture, CVA Holdco, LLC, with EBCI and an additional minority partner, to construct, own and operate a gaming facility in Danville, Virginia (“Caesars Virginia”). Caesars Virginia opened in a temporary facility on May 15, 2023 followed by the completion of construction and opening of the permanent facility on December 17, 2024. As the managing member, the Company operates the business and has managed the development, construction, financing, marketing, leasing, maintenance and day-to-day operation of the various phases of the project. The Company holds a 
50.0
% variable interest in the joint venture and is the primary beneficiary; as such, the joint venture’s operations are included in the Financial Statements, with a minority interest recorded reflecting the operations attributed to the other partner. The

Company participates ratably, based on ownership percentage, with the partners in the profits and losses of the joint venture. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company made distributions totaling $
16
 million to the partners.
Pompano Joint Venture
In April 2018, the Company entered into a joint venture with Cordish Companies (“Cordish”) to plan and develop a mixed-use entertainment and hospitality destination expected to be located on unused land adjacent to the casino at the Company’s Pompano property. As the managing member, Cordish will operate the business and manage the development, construction, financing, marketing, leasing, maintenance and day-to-day operation of the various phases of the project. Additionally, Cordish will be responsible for the development of the master plan for the project with the Company’s input and will submit it for the Company’s review and approval. While the Company holds a 
50
% variable interest in the joint venture, it is not the primary beneficiary; as such, the investment in the joint venture is accounted for using the equity method and is recorded in Investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates on the Balance Sheets. The Company participates evenly with Cordish in the profits and losses of the joint venture, which are included in Transaction and other costs, net on the Statements of Operations.

Segment Information
The executive decision maker of the Company reviews operating results, assesses performance and makes decisions on a “significant market” basis. Management views each of the Company’s casinos as an operating segment. Operating segments are aggregated based on their similar economic characteristics, types of customers, types of services and products provided, and their management and reporting structure. The Company’s principal operating activities occur in 
four
 reportable segments. The reportable segments are based on the similar characteristics of the operating segments with the way management assesses these results and allocates resources, which is a consolidated view that adjusts for the effect of certain transactions between these reportable segments within Caesars: (1) Las Vegas, (2) Regional, (3) Caesars Digital, and (4) Managed and Branded, in addition to Corporate and Other. See table below for a summary of these segments. Also, see

Certain of our properties operate off-track betting locations, including Harrah’s Hoosier Park Racing & Casino, which operates Winner’s Circle Indianapolis and Winner’s Circle New Haven, and Horseshoe Indianapolis, which operates Winner’s Circle Clarksville. On December 12, 2024, we sold the LINQ Promenade, which is an open-air dining, entertainment, and retail promenade next to The LINQ Hotel & Casino (the “LINQ”). We continue to operate the High Roller, a 
550

270
 hotel rooms, approximately 
20,000
 square feet of event space and hotel amenities including, pools, bars, lounges, and celebrity partnered restaurants.
Corporate and Other includes certain unallocated corporate overhead costs and other adjustments, including eliminations of transactions among segments, to reconcile to the Company’s consolidated results.
The Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) is the Chief Executive Officer. The CODM assesses segment performance by using Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined and reconciled to net income (loss) below.
The CODM uses Adjusted EBITDA during the annual budgeting process and evaluates budget-to-actual variances on a regular basis to make decisions about the allocation of operating and capital resources. Annual incentive awards have historically been based on the achievement of Adjusted EBITDA as a primary metric as the Company believes it most accurately reflects our results and represents a key metric in our industry.

____________________
(a)
Labor expense for the Las Vegas segment includes $
49
 million and $
65
 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to Rio-All Suite Hotel & Casino which was divested at the end of the third quarter of 2023.
(b)
The ‘Other segment expenses’ category for each of our reportable segments primarily includes:
•
Las Vegas and Regional Segments
 - Cost of sales associated with food, beverage and retail offerings; commission fees, talent fees and ticketing expenses associated with entertainment offerings; utility costs; costs of supplies; repairs and maintenance charges; professional fees; marketing and advertising expenses; software and licensing expenses; rental costs; and insurance expense.
•
Caesars Digital
 - Labor costs directly associated with the operation and maintenance of the digital platforms; professional fees; marketing and advertising expenses; and software and licenses expenses.
•
Managed and Branded 
- Reimbursable expenses which are primarily payroll costs associated with our managed properties.
•
Corporate and Other 
- Unallocated corporate payroll and overhead costs.
Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Caesars to Adjusted EBITDA by Segment
Adjusted EBITDA is presented as a measure of the Company’s performance. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as revenues less certain operating expenses and is composed of net income (loss) before (i) interest income and interest expense, net of interest capitalized, (ii) income tax (benefit) provision, (iii) depreciation and amortization, and (iv) certain items that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance at an operating property level.
In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA you should be aware that, in the future, we may incur expenses that are the same or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that future results will be unaffected by unusual or unexpected items.
Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure commonly used in our industry and should not be construed as an alternative to net income (loss) as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity (as determined in accordance with GAAP). Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies within the industry. Adjusted EBITDA is included because management uses Adjusted EBITDA to measure performance and allocate resources, and believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with additional information consistent with that used by management.

Item 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
None.
Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We have established and maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports that we file under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized, evaluated and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2024. Based on these evaluations, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures required by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) were effective as of December 31, 2024, at a reasonable assurance level.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act. This system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with US GAAP.
Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated and assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K Annual Report based upon the framework set forth in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on their evaluation and assessment, they concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.
Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, which follows below.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
As of December 31, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Caesars Entertainment, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Caesars Entertainment, Inc., and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 25, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. 
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
