Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 12, 2024 which is incorporated by reference herein.

Overview

Our vision is a world in which every item that enterprises manufacture, transport and sell, and that people own, use and recycle, is wirelessly and ubiquitously connected to the cloud. And a world in which the ownership, history and linked information for every one of those items is seamlessly available to enterprises and people. We call our expansive vision a Boundless Internet of Things, or IoT. We design and sell a platform that enables that wireless item-to-cloud connectivity and with which we and our partners innovate IoT solutions.

Our mission is to connect every thing. We have enabled connectivity for more than 120 billion items to date, delivering item visibility and improving operational efficiencies for retailers, supply chain and logistics, or SC&L providers, restaurants and food-service providers, airlines, automobile manufacturers, healthcare companies and many more. We are today focused on extending item connectivity from tens of billions to trillions of items, and delivering item data not just to enterprises but to people, so they too can derive value from their connected items. We believe the Boundless IoT we are enabling will, in the not-too-distant future, give people ubiquitous access to cloud-based digital twins of every item, each storing the item’s history and linked information and helping people explore and learn about the item. We believe that that connectivity will transform the world.

We and our partner ecosystem build item-visibility solutions using products that we design and either sell or license, including silicon RAIN radios; manufacturing, test, encoding and reading systems, software and cloud services that encapsulate our solutions know-how and intellectual property. We sell two types of silicon IC radios. The first are endpoint ICs that store a serialized number to wirelessly identify an item. Our partners embed endpoint ICs into an item or its packaging. The ICs may also contain a cryptographic key to authenticate the item. The second are reader ICs that our partners use in finished readers to wirelessly discover, inventory and engage the endpoint ICs. Those readers may also protect an item or consumer, for example by authenticating the item as genuine or privatizing the item by rendering the endpoint IC unresponsive without the consumer first providing a password. Our manufacturing, test and encoding systems enable partner products and facilitate enterprise deployments. Our reading systems comprise high-performance finished readers and gateways for autonomous reading solutions. Our software and cloud services focus on solutions enablement.

We sell our products, individually or as a whole platform offering primarily with or through our partner ecosystem. That ecosystem comprises original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, tag service bureaus, original device manufacturers, or ODMs, systems integrators, or SIs, value-added resellers, or VARs, independent software vendors, or ISVs, and other solution partners.

Our radios follow the RAIN industry’s air-interface standard for their core reading functionality. We create partner and enterprise preference for our radios and solutions by adding differentiated features into our products, including our Gen2X functionality, supporting those features across our platform and licensing them where appropriate, to deliver solutions capabilities and performance that surpasses mix-and-match solutions built from competitor products.

Factors Affecting Our Performance

Inventory Supply

Most of our revenue derives from endpoint ICs that our partners embed into or onto enterprise items and is therefore affected by macroeconomic trends. Further, we sell most of our products, both endpoint ICs and systems, through partners and distributors, limiting our visibility to enterprise demand. We work closely with those partners and distributors to gain as accurate a view as possible, however, correctly forecasting demand for our products and identifying market shifts in a timely manner remains a challenge. As a result, we sometimes experience inventory overages or shortages. Inventory overages can increase expenses, expose us to product obsolescence and/or increased reserves and negatively affect our business. Inventory shortages can cause long lead times, missed opportunities, market-share losses and/or damaged customer relationships, also negatively affecting our business.

In 2021 and 2022, demand for our endpoint ICs increased while worldwide wafer demand also increased, leading to wafer shortfalls for many semiconductor companies, including us. These wafer shortfalls prevented us from fully meeting customer demand and, in some cases, caused customers to cancel orders, qualify alternative suppliers or purchase from our competitors. In 2023, macroeconomic conditions led to softness in demand and inventory overages.

Product Adoption and Unit Growth Rates

Enterprises have significantly adopted RAIN in retail apparel, our largest market, and SC&L, but the rate of adoption and unit growth rates have been uneven and unpredictable. From 2010 to 2024, our overall endpoint IC sales volumes increased at a 27% compounded annual growth rate; however, we have experienced declines in endpoint IC sales volumes during various periods.

Regardless of the uneven pace of retail, SC&L and other industry adoption and growth rates, we believe the long-term trend is continued RAIN adoption and growth and we intend to continue investing in developing new products and expanding our product offerings for the foreseeable future. However, we cannot predict whether historical annual growth rates are indicative of the pace of future growth.

Our systems business, at least for readers and gateways, depends significantly on large-scale deployments at discrete end users, and deployment timing causes large yearly variability in our systems revenue. For example, we generated 14% of total 2019 revenue from a gateway deployment at a large North American SC&L provider. We did not have comparable project-based revenue in 2020. Similarly, in second-quarter 2021, we generated 13% of our revenue from a project-based gateway deployment for RAIN-based self-checkout and loss prevention at a large Europe-based global retailer. Although we continue generating project-based revenue, we have not seen it at a comparable scale in 2022, 2023 or in 2024.

Seasonality and Pricing

We typically negotiate pricing with most of our endpoint IC OEMs with an effective date of the first quarter of the calendar year. In the past, this negotiation typically resulted in reduced revenue and gross margins in the first quarter compared to prior periods, which then normalized in subsequent quarters as we reduced costs and adjust product mix by migrating those OEMs and end users to newer, lower-cost products.

Endpoint IC volumes tend to be lower in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. System sales tend to be higher in the fourth quarter and lower in the first quarter, we believe due to the availability of residual funding for capital expenditures prior to the end of many end users’ fiscal years.

We did not see these seasonal trends in 2022 or 2023 but began to see them in the second half of 2024. Quarter-to-quarter revenue variability due to macroeconomic conditions and program-launch timing may impact these seasonal trends in the future.

Revenue and gross profit increased, due primarily to higher endpoint IC and partially offset by lower systems revenue. The endpoint IC revenue increase was driven primarily by higher shipment volumes and licensing revenue partially offset by lower average ASP due to mix and short-term pricing incentives on legacy products, and the systems revenue decrease was due primarily to lower shipment volumes. Gross margin increased due primarily to high-margin licensing revenue recognized in the year that did not occur in the prior year. Loss from operations decreased due primarily to increased gross profit.

We currently derive substantially all our revenue from sales of endpoint ICs, reader ICs, readers, gateways, test and measurement solutions and licensing. We sell our endpoint ICs and test and measurement solutions primarily to inlay manufacturers; our reader ICs primarily to OEMs and ODMs through distributors; and our readers and gateways to solutions providers, VARs and SIs, also primarily through distributors. We expect endpoint IC sales to represent the majority of our revenue for the foreseeable future.

Endpoint IC revenue increased $71.5 million, due primarily to a $79.7 million increase from higher shipment volumes and $15.0 million from licensing revenue that did not occur in the prior year, partially offset by a $23.2 million decrease due to lower average ASP, the latter due primarily to product mix shift, and to a lesser extent, short-term pricing incentives on legacy products.

Systems revenue decreased $12.9 million due primarily to a decrease in shipment volumes. Reader and gateway revenue decreased $5.8 million and $8.6 million, respectively. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $3.1 million from test and measurement solutions revenue.

Cost of revenue includes costs associated with manufacturing our endpoint ICs, reader ICs, readers, gateways and test and measurement solutions, including direct materials and outsourced manufacturing costs as well as associated overhead costs such as logistics, quality control, planning and procurement. Cost of revenue also includes charges for excess and obsolescence and warranty costs. Our gross margin varies from period to period based on the mix of endpoint IC and systems; underlying product margins driven by changes in mix, ASPs or costs; as well as from inventory excess and obsolescence charges.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of December 31, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $164.7 million, comprising cash deposits held at major financial institutions and short-term investments in a variety of securities, including U.S. government securities, treasury bills, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper and money market funds. As of December 31, 2024, we had working capital of $(4.8) million, down from $238.8 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease was driven by the reclassification of our convertible debt from long-term to current, due to certain conditions being met (refer to Note 8 our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further information). This decrease was partially offset by an increase in cash and short-term investments.

Historically, we have funded our operations primarily through cash generated from operations and by issuing equity securities, convertible-debt offerings and/or borrowing under our prior senior credit facility.

We believe, based on our current operating plan, that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. Over the longer term, we plan to continue investing to enhance and extend our platform. If our available funds are insufficient to fund our future activities or execute our strategy, then we may raise additional capital through equity, equity-linked or debt financing, to the extent such funding sources are available. Alternatively, we may need to reduce expenses to manage liquidity; however, any such reductions could adversely impact our business and competitive position.

Sources of Funds

From time to time, we may explore additional financing sources and ways to reduce our cost of capital, including equity, equity-linked and debt financing. In addition, in connection with any future acquisitions, we may pursue additional financing which may be debt, equity or equity-linked financing or a combination thereof. We can provide no assurance that any additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms.

2021 Notes

In November 2021, we issued convertible notes due in 2027 in an aggregate principal amount of $287.5 million, which we refer to as the 2021 Notes. The 2021 Notes are our senior unsecured obligation, bearing interest at a fixed rate of 1.125% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on May 15, 2022. The 2021 Notes are convertible into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our election, and will mature on May 15, 2027 unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted in accordance with the indenture terms.

46

Table of Contents

The net proceeds from the 2021 Notes were approximately $278.4 million after initial debt issuance costs, fees and expenses. We used approximately $183.6 million of the net proceeds to repurchase approximately $76.4 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due 2026, or the 2019 Notes through individual privately negotiated transactions concurrent with the 2021 Notes offering. We used $17.6 million to repurchase the remaining $9.85 million aggregate principal of the 2019 Notes through individual privately negotiated transactions in June 2022. Please refer to the section “
Repurchase of the Convertible Senior Notes – 2019
” as described in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. We will use the rest of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.

For further information on the terms of this debt, please refer to Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.

Operating Cash Flows

For the year ended December 31, 2024, we generated $128.3 million of net cash from operating activities. These net cash proceeds were due to $112.3 million of net income adjusted for non-cash items and $16.0 million of working capital proceeds due primarily to higher accrued compensation and employee related benefits and accounts payable, partially offset by lower operating lease liabilities, acquisition related contingent consideration liability and higher inventory.

Investing Cash Flows

For the year ended December 31, 2024, we used $192.6 million of net cash from investing activities. This net cash usage was due primarily to purchases of investment of $202.1 million and property and equipment purchases of $17.1 million, partially offset by proceeds from maturities of investments of $26.6 million.

Financing Cash Flows

For the year ended December 31, 2024, we generated $15.7 million of net cash from financing activities. These net cash proceeds were due to $20.3 million from stock-option exercises and our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, partially offset by $4.6 million of cash paid for the earnout payment related to the Voyantic Oy acquisition.

Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements

Since inception, we have not had any relationships with unconsolidated entities, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special-purpose entities, or financial partnerships that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance-sheet arrangements or for another contractually narrow or limited purpose.

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements which we have prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Generally, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions, in accordance with GAAP, that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under other assumptions or conditions.

Critical accounting policies and estimates are those we consider the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our critical accounting policies and estimates include those related to:

•
revenue recognition;

•
inventory;

•
income taxes; and

•
stock-based compensation.

Revenue Recognition

We generate revenue primarily from sales of hardware products. We also generate revenue from software, extended warranties, enhanced maintenance, support services and NRE development services, none of which are material.

We recognize revenue when we transfer control of the promised goods or services to our customers, which for hardware sales is generally at the time of product shipment as determined by agreed-upon shipping terms. We measure revenue based on the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled-to in exchange for those goods or services. We expect the period between when we transfer control of promised goods or services and when we receive payment to be one year or less, and that expectation is consistent with our historical experience. As such, we do not adjust our revenue for the effects of a significant financing component. We recognize any variable consideration, which comprises primarily sales incentives, as revenue reduction at the time of revenue recognition. We estimate sales incentives based on our historical experience and current expectations at the time of revenue recognition and update them at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available.

Our reader and gateway products are highly dependent on embedded software and cannot function without this embedded software. We account for the hardware and embedded software as a single performance obligation and recognize revenue when control is transferred.

48

Table of Contents

Our customer contracts with multiple performance obligations generally include a combination of hardware products, extended warranty, enhanced maintenance and support services. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. We allocate the transaction price to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling-price basis. In instances where the standalone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the standalone selling price using one, or a combination of, the adjusted market assessment or expected cost-plus margin. We defer amounts allocated to extended warranty and enhanced maintenance sold with our reader and gateway products and recognize them on a straight-line basis over the term of the arrangement, which is typically from one to three years. We defer amounts allocated to support services sold with our reader and gateway products and recognize them when we transfer control of the promised services to our customers.

Revenue generated from licensing our intellectual property is governed by licensing agreements. We recognize revenue from licensing the right to use functional intellectual property at the point in time the control of the license transfers to the customer, which is generally upon delivery, or as usage occurs.

If a customer pays consideration before we transfer a good or service under the contract, then we classify those amounts as contract liabilities, or deferred revenue. We recognize contract liabilities as revenue when we transfer control of the promised goods or services to our customers.

Payment terms typically range from 30 to 120 days. We present revenue net of sales tax in our consolidated statements of operations. We include shipping charges billed to customers in revenue and the related shipping costs in cost of revenue.

Practical Expedients and Exemptions:
 We expense sales commissions when incurred because we expect the amortization period to be one year or less. We record these costs within sales and marketing expenses. We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (1) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (2) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed.

Inventory

We state inventories at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value using the average costing method, which approximates a first-in, first-out method. Inventories comprise raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods. We continuously assess our inventory value and write down its value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory. This evaluation includes an analysis of inventory on hand, current and forecasted demand, product development plans and market conditions. If future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, or our product development plans change from current expectations, then a write-down of excess or obsolete inventory may be required and is reflected in cost of goods sold in the period the updated information is known.

 Income Taxes

We use the asset and liability approach for accounting, which requires recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. We recognize the effects of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities in the year that of the enactment date. We determine deferred tax assets, including historical net operating losses and deferred tax liabilities, based on temporary differences between the book and tax bases of the assets and liabilities. We believe that it is currently more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized and, as such, we have recorded a full valuation allowance for these assets. We evaluate the likelihood of our ability to realize deferred tax assets in future periods on a quarterly basis, and if evidence indicates we will be able to realize some or all of our deferred tax assets then we will revise our valuation allowance accordingly.

Table of Contents

We use a two-step approach for evaluating uncertain tax positions. First, we evaluate recognition, which requires us to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes. If we consider a tax position more likely than not to be unsustained, then no benefits of the position are recognized. Second, we measure the uncertain tax position based on the largest amount of benefit which is more likely than not to be realized on effective settlement. This process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure, including assessing the risks associated with tax audits, together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. If actual results differ from our estimates, then our net operating loss and credit carryforwards could be materially impacted.

Us realizing the benefits of the NOLs and credit carryforwards depends on sufficient taxable income in future years. We have established a valuation allowance against the carrying value of our deferred tax assets, as it is currently more likely than not we will be unable to realize these deferred tax assets. In addition, using NOLs and credits to offset future income subject to taxes may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the “change in ownership” provisions of the Code and similar state provisions. Events that cause limitations in the amount of NOLs that we may use in any one year include, but are not limited to, a cumulative ownership change of more than 50%, as defined by Code Sections 382 and 383, over a three-year period. Using our NOLs and tax credit carryforwards could be significantly reduced if a cumulative ownership change of more than 50% has occurred in our past or occurs in our future.

We do not anticipate that the amount of our existing unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months. Due to our NOLs, in most jurisdictions our tax years remain open for examination by taxing authorities back to 2004.

Stock-Based Compensation

We have various equity award plans, or Plans for granting share-based awards to employees, consultants and non-employee directors of the Company. The Plans provide for granting several forms of stock compensation such as stock option awards, restricted stock units, or RSUs, RSUs with performance conditions, or PSUs, and RSUs with market and service conditions, or MSUs.

We measure stock-based compensation costs for all share-based awards at fair value on the measurement date, which is typically the grant date. We determine the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which considers, among other things, estimates and assumptions on the expected life of the options, stock price volatility and market value of the Company’s common stock. We determine the fair value of RSUs and PSUs based on the closing price of our common stock at grant date. Additionally, for awards with a market condition, we use a Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate grant date fair value, which takes into consideration the range of possible stock price of total stockholder return outcomes.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

For information on recent accounting pronouncements, please refer to Note 2 in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitati
ve Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Some of these risks are related to fluctuations in interest rates.

Interest Rate Risk

Under our current investment policy, we invest our excess cash in money market funds, U.S. government securities, corporate bonds and notes and commercial paper. Our current investment policy seeks first to preserve principal, second to provide liquidity for our operating and capital needs and third to maximize yield without putting our principal at risk. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.

50

Table of Contents

We had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $164.7 million and $113.2 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our investments are exposed to market risk due to fluctuations in prevailing interest rates, which may reduce the yield on our investments or their fair value. Because most of our investment portfolio is short-term in nature, we do not believe an immediate 10% increase in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio, and therefore we do not expect our results of operations or cash flows to be materially affected by a sudden change in market interest rates.

Our convertible notes have fixed interest rates, thus a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would not impact interest expense.

Inflation Risk

We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. To date, we have been able to substantially offset higher product costs by increasing our product selling prices. If our product costs became subject to significant future inflationary pressures, then we may not be able to fully offset these higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

We are subject to risks associated with transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currency and the effects of translating amounts denominated in a foreign currency to the U.S. dollar as a normal part of our reporting process. The functional currency of the majority of our foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, gains and losses resulting from remeasuring transactions denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars are included in other income, net, on our consolidated statements of operations. One of our European subsidiaries utilizes Euros as their functional currency, which results in a translation adjustment that we include as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. For any of the periods presented, we did not have material impact from exposure to foreign currency fluctuation. As we grow our operations, our exposure to foreign currency risk will likely become more significant.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Impinj, Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Impinj, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations,

comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders’ equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 10, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Inventory valuation

Description of the Matter

The Company's inventory totaled $99.3 million as of December 31, 2024. As explained in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company determines the appropriate value of all inventory in each reporting period. Obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management's estimated usage requirement is written down to its estimated net realizable value if those amounts are determined to be less than cost.

Auditing management's estimates for excess and obsolete inventory involved subjective auditor judgment because the estimates are affected by market and economic conditions outside the Company's control, including management's assumptions about the product demand and life cycle.

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the Company's excess and obsolete inventory reserve estimate. This included management's determination of the assumptions and data underlying the excess and obsolete inventory valuation.
To test the Company's estimates for excess and obsolete inventory, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, testing the accuracy and completeness of the underlying data used in the estimation calculations and evaluating significant assumptions (e.g., forecasted customer demand and product life cycle). We assessed forecast accuracy by comparing historical forecast to actual results. We also performed sensitivity analysis to evaluate the changes in the excess and obsolete inventory estimates that would result from changes in the underlying assumptions.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Impinj, Inc.

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited Impinj, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Impinj, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of 
operations, 
comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders’ equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated February 10, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention

55

Table of Contents

or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

IMPINJ, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1. Description of Business
Impinj, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is headquartered in Seattle, Washington. The Impinj platform wirelessly connects items and delivers data about the connected items to business and consumer applications. Impinj generates revenue from enterprise solutions that use our platform's constituent elements — endpoint ICs, reader ICs, readers gateways, and test and measurement solutions — as well as from development, service and license agreements.

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include Impinj, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. We have eliminated intercompany balances and transactions in consolidation. We have prepared these consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.
All numbers in the consolidated financial statements are rounded to the nearest thousand, except for per share data, and numbers in the notes to the consolidated financial statements are rounded to the nearest million.

Use of Estimates
Preparing financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures as of the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenue and expenses during the periods presented. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to revenue recognition, sales incentives, the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contingent consideration in business combinations, inventory excess and obsolescence and income taxes. To the extent there are material differences between our estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected.

Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments, which potentially subject us to credit-risk concentration, comprise primarily cash equivalents, investments and accounts receivable. We place our cash and cash equivalents and investments with major financial institutions, which management assesses to be of high credit quality, to limit our investment exposure. We extend credit to customers based on our evaluation of the customer’s financial condition and generally do not require collateral. 
The following tables present total revenue and accounts receivable concentration for the indicated periods as of the dates presented:

Concentration of Supplier Risk
We outsource the manufacturing and production of our hardware products to a small number of suppliers. We believe other suppliers could provide similar products on comparable terms if needed. However, a supplier change could delay manufacturing and cause a sales loss, which would adversely affect our operating results.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash includes demand deposits with banks or financial institutions. Cash equivalents include short-term, highly liquid investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash and so near their maturity that they present minimal risk of changes in value with changes in interest rates. Our cash equivalents are solely investments with an original or remaining maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase. We regularly maintain cash amounts exceeding federally insured limits at financial institutions.

Investments
Our investments comprise fixed income securities, including U.S. government securities, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper and asset-backed securities. The contractual maturities of some of our available-for-sale, or AFS, debt securities exceed a year and are classified as long-term investments on our balance sheet. We carry AFS debt securities at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Our investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. We recognize an impairment charge when a decline in fair value of an investment below the cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary. Factors we consider in determining whether a loss is temporary include the extent and length of time the investment's fair value has been lower than its cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, our intent to sell the security and whether or not we will be required to sell the security prior to the expected recovery of the investment's amortized cost basis. 
No
 such impairment changes were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. See Note 3 t
ables for the cost or amortized cost, gross unrealized gains, gross unrealized losses and total estimated fair value of our financial assets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Fair Value Measurement
Accounting standards define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The standards also establish a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:
•
Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
•
Level 2 — Assets and liabilities valued based on observable market data for similar instruments, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities.
•
Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity; instruments valued based on the best available data, some of which are internally developed, and considers risk premiums that a market participant would require.

64

Table of Contents

We do 
no
t have any financial assets or liabilities in Level 3 as of December 31, 2024, and only had the liability for the earnout consideration related to the Voyantic Oy acquisition as of December 31, 2023. We
 classified this liability as such because we determined the fair value using significant unobservable inputs. See Note 3: Fair Value Measurements and Note 6: Goodwill and Intangible Assets.

We applied the following methods and assumptions in estimating our fair value measurements:
Cash Equivalents 
— Cash equivalents comprise highly liquid investments, including money market funds with original maturities of less than three months at the acquisition date. We record the fair value measurement of these assets based on quoted market prices in active markets.
Investments
 — Our investments comprise fixed income securities, which include U.S. government agency securities, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, treasury bills and asset-backed securities. The fair value measurement of these assets is based on observable market-based inputs or inputs that are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means.
Long-term Debt
 —See Note 8 for the carrying amount and estimated fair value of the Notes.

Contingent Consideration
 — The contingent consideration liability is related to our acquisition of Voyantic Oy (see Note 6: Goodwill and Intangible Assets). We paid the contingent consideration amount of $
7.2
 million in second-quarter 2024.

Accounts Receivable and Allowances
Accounts receivable comprises amounts billed and currently due from customers, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, sales returns and price exceptions.
The allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable lifetime-expected credit losses in existing accounts receivable and is determined based on our historical collections experience, age of the receivable, knowledge of the customer and the condition of the general economy and industry as a whole. We record changes in our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts through bad debt expense and write off the receivable and corresponding allowance when accounts are ultimately determined to be uncollectible. We include bad debt expense in general and administrative expenses. For the periods presented in this report, bad debt expense and the allowance for doubtful accounts were not material.
We derive most of our accounts receivable from sales to original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, original design manufacturers, ODMs, solution providers and distributors who are large, well-established companies. We do not have customers that represent a significant credit risk based on current economic conditions and past collection experience. Also, we have not had material past-due balances on our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2024 or 2023.
The allowance for sales returns and price exceptions is our best estimate based on our historical experience and currently available evidence. We record changes in our estimate of the allowance for sales returns and price exceptions through revenue, and relieve the allowance when we receive product returns or process claims for price exceptions. 
The following table summarizes our allowance for sales returns (in thousands):

Inventory

65

Table of Contents

We state inventories at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value using the average costing method, which approximates a first-in, first-out method. Inventories comprise raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods. We continuously assess our inventory value and write down its value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory. This evaluation includes an analysis of inventory on hand, current and forecasted demand, product development plans and market conditions. If future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, or our product development plans change from current expectations, then a write-down of excess or obsolete inventory may be required and is reflected in cost of goods sold in the period the updated information is known.
Excess and obsolescence charges had an immaterial impact on our 2024, 2023 and 2022 gross margin.

Property and Equipment
We record property and equipment at cost and depreciate it using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. The useful lives are as follows:

Category

Useful Life

Machinery and equipment

1
 to 
10 years

Computer equipment and software

3
 to 
5 years

Furniture and fixtures

3
 to 
7 years

Equipment acquired under finance leases

3
 to 
7 years

Leasehold improvements

Shorter of remaining lease term or expected useful life

We charge maintenance and repair costs to expense when incurred. We capitalize major improvements, which extend the useful life of the related asset. Upon disposal of a fixed asset, we record a gain or loss based on the differences between the proceeds received and the net book value of the disposed asset.

Other Assets
Other assets comprise primarily capitalized implementation costs from cloud computing arrangements and security deposits. We capitalize eligible costs associated with cloud computing arrangements over the term of the arrangement, plus reasonably certain renewals, and recognize those costs on a straight-line basis in the same line item in the consolidated statement of operations as the expense for fees associated with the cloud computing arrangement. Cloud computing arrangement costs, included in prepaid expenses and other current assets, were 
$
0.4
 million and $
0.4
 million
, and other non-current assets w
ere $
1.0
 million and $
1.4
 million
, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Amortization expense associated with the cloud computing arrangements was
 $
0.4
 million for 2024, 
$
0.5
 million for 2023, and $
0.4
 million for 2022. We present cash flows related to capitalized implementation costs in cash flows used in operating activities.

Business Combinations and Intangible Assets Including Goodwill
We account for business combinations using the acquisition method which involves allocating the purchase price paid to assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition-date fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately estimate the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and the contingent consideration liability, our estimates are inherently uncertain. These estimates include, but are not limited to, estimates of future revenue, revenue growth rates, discount rates, underlying product or technology life cycles and expenses necessary to support the acquired technology, and estimated sales cycle for customer relationships. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill.

We review assumptions related to the fair value of the contingent consideration each reporting period until the contingency is satisfied. We recognize the change in fair value of the contingent

66

Table of Contents

consideration liability in “General and administrative” expense on the consolidated statements of operations for the period in which the fair value changes.
We assess the impairment of goodwill on an annual basis, during the fourth quarter, or otherwise when events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired.
We amortize identifiable intangible assets with finite lives over their useful lives on a straight-line basis.

We expense acquisition-related costs, including advisory, legal, accounting, valuation and other similar costs in the periods in which the costs are incurred.

Revenue Recognition
We generate revenue primarily from sales of hardware products. We also generate revenue from software, extended warranties, enhanced maintenance, support services and nonrecurring engineering, or NRE, development services, none of which are material.

We recognize revenue when we transfer control of the promised goods or services to our customers, which for hardware sales is generally at the time of product shipment as determined by agreed-upon shipping terms. We measure revenue based on the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled-to in exchange for those goods or services. We expect the period between when we transfer control of promised goods or services and when we receive payment to be 
one year
 or less, and that expectation is consistent with our historical experience. As such, we do not adjust our revenue for the effects of a significant financing component. We recognize any variable consideration, which comprises primarily sales incentives, as revenue reduction at the time of revenue recognition. We estimate sales incentives based on our historical experience and current expectations at the time of revenue recognition and update them at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available.
Our reader and gateway products are highly dependent on embedded software and cannot function without this embedded software. We account for the hardware and embedded software as a single performance obligation and recognize revenue when control is transferred.

Our customer contracts with multiple performance obligations generally include a combination of hardware products, extended warranty, enhanced maintenance and support services. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. We allocate the transaction price to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling-price basis. In instances where the standalone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the standalone selling price using one, or a combination of, the adjusted market assessment or expected cost-plus margin. We defer amounts allocated to extended warranty and enhanced maintenance sold with our reader and gateway products and recognize them on a straight-line basis over the term of the arrangement, which is typically from 
one
 to 
three years
. We defer amounts allocated to support services sold with our reader and gateway products and recognize them when we transfer control of the promised services to our customers.
Revenue generated from licensing our intellectual property is governed by licensing agreements. We recognize revenue from licensing the right to use functional intellectual property at the point in time the control of the license transfers to the customer, which is generally upon delivery, or as usage occurs.
If a customer pays consideration before we transfer a good or service under the contract, then we classify those amounts as contract liabilities or deferred revenue. We recognize contract liabilities as revenue when we transfer control of the promised goods or services to our customers.

Payment terms typically range from 
30
 to 
120 days
. We present revenue net of sales tax in our consolidated statements of operations. We include shipping charges billed to customers in revenue and the related shipping costs in cost of revenue.
Practical Expedients and Exemptions:
 We expense sales commissions when incurred because we expect the amortization period to be 
one year
 or 
less. We record these costs within sales and marketing expenses. We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (1) contracts with an

67

Table of Contents

original 
expected length of 
one year or less
 and (2) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed.

Product Warranties
We provide limited warranty coverage for most products, generally ranging from a period of 
90
 days to 
one year
 from the date of shipment. We record a liability for the estimated cost of these warranties based on historical claims, product failure rates and other factors when we recognize the related revenue. We review these estimates periodically and adjust our warranty reserves when actual experience differs from historical estimates or when other information becomes available. The warranty liability primarily includes the anticipated cost of materials, labor and shipping necessary to repair or replace the product. Accrued warranty costs in 
2024, 2023
 and 2022 were not material.

Leases
We determine, at inception, whether an arrangement is or contains a lease. Right-of-use, or ROU, assets represent our right to use an identified asset for the lease term. Lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. We recognize operating lease ROU assets and liabilities at commencement date based on the present value of future lease payments over the lease term. We use an incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of future lease payments because our operating leases do not provide an implicit rate. Our incremental borrowing rate is based on a credit-adjusted risk-free rate, which best approximates a secured rate over a similar term of lease. We recognize lease expense for lease payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Our lease agreements may contain variable costs such as common area maintenance, insurance, real estate taxes or other costs. We expense variable lease costs on the consolidated statements of operations as incurred. Our lease agreements generally do not contain any residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.
We have various noncancellable operating lease agreements for office, warehouse and research and 
development space in the United States, China and Finland, with expiration dates from 
2025
 to 
2029
. Certa
in of these arrangements have free or escalating rent payment provisions and optional renewal and termination clauses that we factor into the classification and measurement of the lease when appropriate. These lease agreements typically include lease and non-lease components and are generally accounted for as a single lease component. We consider variable CAM expenses for real estate leases as non-lease components.
We do not record leases with an initial term of 12 months or less on our consolidated balance sheet; we instead recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Research and Development Costs
Research and development expense comprises primarily personnel expenses (salaries, benefits and other employee related costs) and stock-based compensation expense for our product-development personnel; external consulting and service costs; prototype materials; other new-product development costs; and an allocated portion of infrastructure costs which include occupancy, depreciation and software costs.
Foreign Currency

We translate the assets and liabilities of our non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiary into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenue and expenses for this subsidiary are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. We recognize gains and losses from these translations as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. Our subsidiaries that use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, and non-monetary assets and liabilities at historical rates. We have included the gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement in earnings.

68

Table of Contents

Income Taxes
We use the asset and liability approach for accounting, which requires recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. We recognize the effects of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities in the year of the enactment date. We determine deferred tax assets, including historical net operating losses and deferred tax liabilities, based on temporary differences between the book and tax bases of the assets and liabilities. We believe that it is currently more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized and, as such, we have recorded a full valuation allowance for these assets. We evaluate the likelihood of our ability to realize deferred tax assets in future periods on a quarterly basis, and if evidence indicates we will be able to realize some or all of our deferred tax assets then we will revise our valuation allowance accordingly.
We use a two-step approach for evaluating uncertain tax positions. First, we evaluate recognition, which requires us to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes. If we consider a tax position more likely than not to be unsustained, then no benefits of the position are recognized. Second, we measure the uncertain tax position based on the largest amount of benefit which is more likely than not to be realized on effective settlement. This process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure, including assessing the risks associated with tax audits, together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. If actual results differ from our estimates, then our net operating loss and credit carryforwards could be materially impacted.
Us realizing the benefits of the NOLs and credit carryforwards depends on sufficient taxable income in future years. We have established a valuation allowance against the carrying value of our deferred tax assets, as it is currently more likely than not we will be unable to realize these deferred tax assets. In addition, using NOLs and credits to offset future income subject to taxes may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the “change in ownership” provisions of the Code and similar state provisions. Events that cause limitations in the amount of NOLs that we may use in any one year include, but are not limited to, a cumulative ownership change of more than 
50
%, as defined by Code Sections 382 and 383, over a 
three-year
 period. Using our NOLs and tax credit carryforwards could be significantly reduced if a cumulative ownership change of more than 50% has occurred in our past or occurs in our future.
Stock-Based Compensation
We have various equity award plans or Plans for granting share-based awards to employees, consultants and non-employee Company directors. The Plans provide for granting several available forms of stock compensation such as restricted stock units, or RSUs, RSUs with performance conditions, or PSUs, and RSUs with market and service conditions, or MSUs and an employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP.

We measure stock-based compensation costs for all share-based awards at fair value on the measurement date, which is typically the grant date. We determine the fair value of RSUs and PSUs based on the closing price of our common stock at grant date. Additionally, for awards with a market condition, we use a Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate grant date fair value, which takes into consideration the range of possible stock price of total stockholder return outcomes.

Net Earnings (Loss) per Share
We compute net earnings (loss) per share by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding. We have outstanding stock options, RSUs, PSUs, MSUs and an ESPP, each of which we include in our calculation of diluted net loss per share if their effect would be dilutive. We compute diluted net loss per share by considering all potential dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding for the period.

We 
recorded the contingent consideration related to the Voyantic Oy acquisition at its fair value using unobservable inputs and used the Monte Carlo simulation option pricing framework, incorporating contractual terms and assumptions regarding financial forecasts, discount rates and volatility of forecasted revenue and gross margins. A decrease in estimated revenue and gross margins or an increase in the discount rate would decrease the fair value of the contingent consideration liability. The estimated revenue and gross margins are not interrelated inputs. The development and determination of the unobservable inputs for Level 3 fair value measurements and fair value calculations is management's responsibility with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist. During the year ended December

Note 6. Goodwill and Intangible Assets

On April 3, 2023, we acquired all of the outstanding equity of Voyantic Oy for an aggregate purchase price of $
32.7
 million. Our acquisition of Voyantic Oy adds label design, manufacturing and testing to our systems offerings, to advance the quality, reliability and readability of partner inlays. The consideration comprised (i) $
3.6
 million in shares of our common stock valued using the market price on the date of the acquisition, (ii) $
4.6
 million in deferred payments contingent upon revenue and gross margin performance over a one-year period from the acquisition date, and (iii) the remainder in cash paid at closing.

We recorded the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. We recorded the excess of the purchase price over the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as goodwill. The fair value of net assets acquired, goodwill, intangible assets and deferred tax liability were $
2.4
 million, $
15.6
 million, $
18.4
 million and $
3.7
 million, 
respectively. The goodwill amount represents synergies we expect to realize from the business combination and assembled

workforce. 
We allocated the goodwill to our one reporting unit and reportable segment. The acquired goodwill and intangible assets were not deductible for tax purposes.

The transaction-related costs for the acquisition were $
1.0
 million and $
1.7
 million for the years ended 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Transaction expenses and contingent consideration expense are included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
This acquisition did not have a material impact on our reported revenue or net loss amounts for any period presented; therefore, we have not presented historical and pro forma disclosures.
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in business combinations accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.

We have not recorded a liability for U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2024 because we intend to permanently reinvest the earnings outside the United States. We expect the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability, if incurred, to be immaterial.

We continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets in the U.S. but recognize deferred income tax expense (benefit) due to the change in the indefinite deferred tax liability related to goodwill, which is partially offset by indefinite tax attributes.

Realizing deferred tax assets depends on us generating future taxable income, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. We have provided a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 because, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not we will be unable to realize the deferred tax assets.
We acquired Voyantic Oy, a Finnish company on April 3, 2023. As a result of the transaction, we recorded a $
3.7
 million deferred tax liability associated with intangibles, with an offset to goodwill.
We have accumulated federal tax losses of approximately $
190.3
 million and $
230.5
 million, respectively, as of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023
, which are available to reduce future taxable income. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, enacted on December 22, 2017 altered the carryforward period for federal net operating losses and as a result, all net operating losses generated in 2018 and forward have an indefinite life. Of the net operating losses reported, we have accumulated $
141.8
 million with an indefinite life as of 
December 31, 2024
. We have accumulated state tax losses of approximately $
18.8
 million and $
21.3
 million as of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023
, respectively. We also have net research and development credit carryforwards of $
38.7
 million and $
30.5
 million as of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023
, respectively, which are available to reduce future tax liabilities. We began to capitalize research and development expenses in the year ended December 31, 2022 under Section 174. The net impact of this provision resulted in a deferred tax asset of approximately $
46.3
 million and $
32.9
 million as of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The pre-2018 federal and state tax losses and federal research and development credit carryforwards began expiring in 
2020
. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income or income tax liability may be limited. We have completed a formal IRC Section 382 study through 
December 31, 2024 and the attributes disclosed in this footnote reflect the conclusion of that study. However, subsequent ownership changes may affect the limitation in future years.
We are currently not under audit in any tax jurisdiction. Tax years from 2005 through 2024 are currently open for audit by federal and state taxing authorities.
We establish reserves for tax positions based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We establish the reserves when we believe that our tax-return positions

76

might be challenged by taxing authorities, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable.

 million as a

no
 impact to our effective tax rate because we have a full valuation allowance. We do not anticipate that the amount of existing unrecognized tax benefit will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months. We record accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense and their value is 
zero

Note 8. Long-term debt
In December 2019, we issued $

287.5
 million aggregate principal amount of convertible promissory notes due 
May 15, 2027

The 2021 Notes are senior unsecured obligations, do not contain any financial covenants and are governed by indentures (the Indentures). The total net proceeds from the 2021 Notes, after deducting initial debt issuance costs, fees and expenses, was $
278.4
 million. We used approximately $
183.6
 million of the 2021 Notes net proceeds, excluding accrued interest, to repurchase approximately $
76.4
 million aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes through individual privately negotiated transactions concurrent with us offering the 2021 Notes. We used approximately $
17.6
 million, excluding accrued interest, to repurchase the remaining $
9.9
 million aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes in June 2022. We will use the remainder of the net proceeds from the 2021 Notes for general corporate purposes.

77

Table of Contents

Terms of the 2021 Notes
The holders of the 2021 Notes may convert their respective 2021 Notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the respective conversion dates under the following circumstances:
•
during any fiscal quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ending on March 31, 2022 (and only during such fiscal quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock, for at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 
30
 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 
130
% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; 
•
during the 
five
 business day period after any 
five
 consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the 2021 Notes for each trading day was less than 
98
% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; 
•
prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date if we call the 2021 Notes for redemption; or 
•
upon the occurrence of specified corporate events, as described in the indenture.
Regardless of the foregoing circumstances, holders may convert all or any portion of the 2021 Notes, in increments of $1,000 principal amount, on or after February 15, 2027, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date.
We may redeem all or a portion of the 2021 Notes for cash, at our option, on or after November 20, 2024, if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 
130
% of the conversion price at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 
30
 consecutive trading day period at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2021 Notes being redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.

Holders who convert their 2021 Notes in connection with certain corporate events that constitute a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the indenture) are, under certain circumstances, entitled to an increase in the conversion rate. Additionally in the event of a corporate event constituting a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture), holders of the 2021 Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2021 Notes at a repurchase price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the 2021 Notes being repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date.
Our common stock exceeded 
130
% of the conversion price of the 2021 Notes for more than 
20
 trading days during the 
30
 consecutive trading days ended December 31, 2024. Accordingly, the 2021 Notes are convertible at the option of the holders as of December 31, 2024 and therefore, are classified as current portion of long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024. The “if-converted value” exceeded the principal amounts by $
88.6
 million based on the closing price of our common stock of $
145.26
 as of December 31, 2024.

Accounting for the Notes
Effective January 1, 2021, we early adopted ASU 2020-06, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20), using the modified retrospective approach. 
We accounted for the 2021 Notes issuance as a single liability measured at its amortized cost, as no other embedded features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives. We presented the 2021 Notes total 
issuance costs of 
$
9.1
 million as a direct deduction from the face amount of the 2021 Notes. We amortized the issuance costs to interest expense over the respective term of the 2021 Notes using the effective interest rate method.

 was $
0.4
 million and $
0.4
 million, respectively. We record accrued interest in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.
Our estimated fair value of the 2021 Notes was $
408.7
 million
 and 
$
314.0
 million as of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023
, respectively, which we determined through consideration of quoted market prices. The fair value for the 2021 Notes is classified as Level 2, as defined in Note 2.
Capped Calls
In connection with the issuance of the 2019 Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped-call transactions with certain financial counterparties. The capped call transactions are generally designed to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion or settlement of the 2019 Notes, or to offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount upon conversion of the 2019 Notes, as the case may be, with the reduction or offset subject to a cap based on the cap price. If, however, the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the cap price of the capped-call transactions, then our stock would experience some dilution and/or the capped call would not fully offset the potential cash payments, in each case, to the extent then-market price per share of our common stock exceeds the cap price. The capped call remains outstanding even though we have repurchased the 2019 Notes, to reduce the potential dilution of the 2021 Notes. The initial cap price of the capped call transactions is $
54.20
 per share, subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the capped call transactions. The capped call transactions expire over 
40

consecutive scheduled trading days ending on 
December 11, 2026
. The capped call transactions meet the criteria for classification in equity, are not accounted for as derivatives and are not remeasured each reporting period.
Repurchase of the Convertible Senior Notes – 2019
In November 2021 and June 2022, we completed a privately negotiated induced conversion of $
76.4
 million and $
9.9
 million principal amount, respectively of the 2019 Notes. We accounted for the 2019 Notes Repurchase transactions as induced conversions in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (ASC 470-20). In connection with the induced conversions, we paid approximately $
183.6
 million in cash in November 2021 an
d $
17.6
 million in cash in June 2022, and also paid accrued and unpaid interest thereon. As a result of the induced conversion, we recorded $
11.3
 million in November 2021 and $
2.2
 million in June 2022 in induced conversion expense which is included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The induced conversion expense represents the fair value of the consideration issued upon conversion in excess of the fair value of the securities issuable under the original terms of the 2019 Notes. We accounted for the remaining cash consideration under the original terms of the 2019 Notes under the general conversion accounting guidance, where the difference between the carrying amount of the 2019 Notes retired, including unamortized debt issuance costs of $
1.8
 million in November 2021 and $
0.2
 million in June 2022, and the cash consideration paid, was recorded in additional paid-in capital.

2016 Equity Incentive Plan
In June 2016, our board of directors adopted and our stockholders approved our 2016 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2016 Plan, which became effective in 
July 2016
 at which time the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2010 Plan, was terminated. 
The number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2016 Plan may increase on January 1 of each year, beginning on January 1, 2017 and ending on and including January 1, 2026, by the lesser of (1) 
1,825,000
 shares; (2) 
5
% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on December 31 of the preceding calendar year; and (3) a lesser number of shares determined by our board of directors.
 The 2016 Plan provides for granting incentive or non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights and performance shares or performance units to employees, non-employee directors and consultants. We have not issued options under the 2016 Plan since the year ended December 31, 2021.
All options historically granted under the 2010 Plan and the 2016 Plan have a maximum 
10
-year term and generally vest and become exercisable over 
four years
 of continued employment or service as defined in each option agreement. As allowed under the 2016 Plan, there are a few exceptions to this vesting schedule, which permit vesting at different rates or based on achieving performance targets. 
We use newly issued shares to satisfy option exercises. As of 
December 31, 2024
, 
we had approximately 
3.6
 million shares of common stock available for future grants.

. In fiscal year 2022, we transitioned to a bonus plan that was half cash and half PSUs. In fiscal years 2023 and 2024, we transitioned to an all cash bonus plan.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Effective July 2016, we adopted the 2016 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the ESPP, allowing eligible employees to authorize payroll deductions of up to 
15
% of their eligible compensation. An ESPP participant may purchase a maximum of 
4,000
 shares, or a lesser number as determined by the IRS rules, each six-month period. The offering periods generally start on the first trading day on or after February 20 and August 20 of each year. Participants in an offering period are granted the right to purchase common shares at a price per share that is 
85
% of the lesser of the fair market value of the shares on (1) the first day of the offering period or (2) the end of the purchase period. The number of shares reserved for the ESPP may increase each year, beginning on January 1, 2017 and continuing through and including January 1, 2036, by the lesser of: (1) 
1
% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on the first day of each year; (2) 
365,411
 shares of common stock; and (3) an amount determined by our board of directors.

As of December 31, 2024, the total unrecognized stock-based compensation from the ESPP was $
0.2
 million, which we will recognize on a straight-line basis over the weighted-average remaining service period of less than 
one year
.

Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies
Indemnification
In the normal course of business, we may enter into agreements that require us to indemnify either customers or suppliers for certain risks. Although we cannot estimate our maximum exposure under these agreements, to date indemnification claims have not had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
Litigation

From time to time, we are subject to various legal proceedings or claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. We accrue a liability when management believes that it is both probable that we have incurred a liability and we can reasonably estimate the amount of loss. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023
, we did 
no
t have accrued contingency liabilities. The following is a description of our significant legal proceedings. Although we believe that resolving these claims, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties.
Patent Infringement Claims and Counterclaims
Impinj Patent Infringement Claims Against NXP
From 2019 to 2023, we engaged in active patent litigation against our primary endpoint IC competitor, NXP Semiconductors N.V., or NXP. During this time, we filed three patent infringement lawsuits against subsidiaries of NXP in federal courts in California and Texas. Our complaints alleged that certain NXP endpoint ICs infringed a number of our U.S. patents. In response, NXP filed a suit against us in federal court in Delaware, later transferred to Washington, countersued us in Texas, and filed three lawsuits against our subsidiary in China. NXP’s complaints alleged that certain of our endpoint ICs infringed a number of their own U.S. or Chinese patents or U.S. patents that they exclusively licensed from a third-party to assert against us.

83

Table of Contents

Through 2023, we prevailed in these lawsuits. In three U.S. trials held in 2023, juries in California and Texas returned verdicts that NXP endpoint ICs infringed five of our patents that made it to trial, and juries in Washington and Texas ruled that we did not infringe any of the three patents NXP accused us in court of infringing. Also in 2023, NXP withdrew all three cases it filed against us in China.
On March 13, 2024, while additional trials were pending in China and Texas, and post-trial motions and appeals were pending in China and the U.S., we and NXP entered into the Settlement Agreement. Under the agreement we and NXP agreed to terminate and withdraw all pending proceedings and release one another for all patent infringement claims preceding March 31, 2024 and grant to each other non-exclusive, worldwide patent licenses to make, have made, import, use, offer for sale and sell their respective products and services, subject to the terms of the agreement. The Settlement Agreement will remain in force until all the valid claims of a specified set of Impinj patents, or the Indicator Patents, expire in about ten years. Either party can terminate the Settlement Agreement if the other party materially breaches the terms of the Agreement and NXP can terminate the Settlement Agreement if it successfully designs out all valid claims of the Indicator Patents.
Under the Settlement Agreement, NXP paid us a one-time amount of $
45
 million and agreed to make annual license fee payments, if the specified set of Indicator Patents are still in use, on April 1 of each year, effective April 1, 2024. The annual license fee will increase by a fixed percentage each year after 2024 for the remaining term of the Settlement Agreement. We have no obligation to pay NXP under the Settlement Agreement.

We allocated the consideration from the Settlement Agreement to the components of the Settlement Agreement. We recorded the $
45
 million payment in income from settlement of litigation in the condensed consolidated statements of operations in first-quarter 2024, upon receipt. Licensing of our intellectual property is part of our ongoing operations and therefore, we will recognize the license fee, which relates to annual usage of the license from April 1 to March 31 of each applicable year, as revenue in the second quarter of each year until the Settlement Agreement terminates. We recognized the first annual license fee of $
15
 million in revenue in second-quarter 2024.
Obligations with Third-Party Manufacturers
We manufacture products with third-party manufacturers. We are committed to purchase $
24.6
 million of inventory as of December 31, 2024
.

Note 13. Deferred Revenue

Note 14. Segment Reporting
We have 
one
 reportable and operating segment: the development and sale of our products and services. We identified our reportable segment based on how our chief operating decision-maker, or CODM, manages our business, makes operating decisions and evaluates our operating performance. Our chief executive officer acts as the CODM and reviews financial and operational information on an entity-wide basis. We have one business activity and there are no segment managers who are held accountable for operations, operating results or plans for levels or components. Accordingly, we have determined that we have a single reporting segment and operating unit structure.
Information by Revenue Categories
Our chief executive officer reviews information about our revenue categories, endpoint ICs and systems, the latter defined as reader ICs, readers, gateways, test and measurement systems and software.

Significant Segment Expenses
We adopted ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures on December 31, 2024. As our CODM manages operations on a consolidated basis, consolidated net income as reported in our Statement of Operations is the US GAAP measure that is used to make operating decisions and evaluate operating performance. The significant expense categories which are used to manage operations are those reflected in our consolidated Statement of Operations.

Note 16. Related-Party Transactions
We have been party to a consulting agreement with a limited liability company owned by Cathal Phelan, a member of our board of directors, pursuant to which Mr. Phelan provided advisory and consulting services to us. We recognized and paid $
0.5
 million in consulting fees to the limited liability company owned by Mr. Phelan for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
No
 consulting fees were recognized and paid in the years ended December 31, 2024 or 2023
y
. Additionally, we granted 
60,000
 shares of stock options to Mr. Phelan on September 21, 2020 in connection with these consulting services, with 
1/24
th
 of the shares subject to the option vesting on October 21, 2020 and 
1/24
th
 of the shares subject to the option vesting on each month thereafter, subject to Mr. Phelan remaining a service provider. Further, in connection with these consulting services, we granted 
8,000
 RSUs to Mr. Phelan on October 1, 2022 with 
¼
th
 of the RSUs vesting on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1, 2023, subject to Mr. Phelan remaining a service provider. 

On January 1, 2023, Mr. Phelan joined our company as Chief Innovation Officer and ceased to provide us with consulting services. Mr. Phelan remains on our board of directors as a non-independent director.

On June 23, 2023, we acquired a patent from a related party in which a member of our board of directors holds an executive leadership position. The patent pertains to our endpoint IC products and the acquisition price was $
0.3
 million. The patent expires on July 17, 2026 and does not have renewal rights. This patent is included in our intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet as of 
December 31, 2024
.

Note 17. Retirement Plans
In 2001, we adopted a salary deferral 401(k) plan for our employees. The plan allows employees to contribute a percentage of their pretax earnings annually, subject to limitations imposed by the Internal R
evenue Service, and allows a matching contribution, subject to certain limitations. We contributed $
1.7
 million a
nd $
1.8
 million as matching contributions for the years ended 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Note 18. Restructuring
On February 7, 2024, we initiated a strategic restructuring to align financial, business and research and development objectives for long-term growth, including a reduction-in-force affecting approximately 
10
% of our employees. We incurred restructuring charges of $
1.8
 million for employee terminations benefits, including equity modification expense in first-quarter 2024. Restructuring payments were complete in second-quarter 2024.

Our management, including our chief executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024. Disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our chief executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2024.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined under Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. We evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report included herein.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended December 31, 2024.

Limitations on Controls

Our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management recognizes that any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain judgments and assumptions and cannot provide absolute assurance that its objectives will be met. Similarly, an evaluation of controls cannot provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
