ITEM 1.          BUSINESS
General
The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated is a leader in experiential dining. We are culinary forward and relentlessly focused on hospitality. We currently own and operate 352 restaurants throughout the United States and Canada under brands including The Cheesecake Factory
®
 (215 locations), North Italia
®
 (43 locations), Flower Child
®
 (38 locations) and additional brands within our Fox Restaurant Concepts (“Other FRC”) portfolio (49 locations). Internationally, 34 The Cheesecake Factory
®
 restaurants operate under licensing agreements. Our bakery division operates two facilities that produce quality cheesecakes and other baked products for our restaurants, international licensees and third-party bakery customers.
Our business originated in 1972 when Oscar and Evelyn Overton founded a small bakery in the Los Angeles area. In 1978, their son, David Overton, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, led the creation and opening of the first The Cheesecake Factory restaurant in Beverly Hills, California. In 1992, the Company was incorporated in Delaware as The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated (referred to herein as the “Company” or as “we,” “us” and “our”). Our executive offices are located at 26901 Malibu Hills Road, Calabasas Hills, California 91301, and our telephone number is (818) 871-3000.
We maintain a general website at www.thecheesecakefactory.com, as well as websites for our bakery and other subsidiaries, including www.northitalia.com , www.iamaflowerchild.com and www.foxrc.com. Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, all amendments to those reports and our proxy statements are available on our general website at no charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after these materials are filed with or furnished to the SEC. Our filings are also available on the SEC’s website at

. The content of our websites is

We utilize a 52/53-week fiscal year ending on the Tuesday closest to December 31 for financial reporting purposes. Fiscal years 2024 and 2023 each consisted of 52 weeks. Fiscal year 2022 consisted of 53 weeks. Fiscal year 2025 will consist of 52 weeks.
Geopolitical and Other Macroeconomic Impacts to our Operating Environment 
In recent years, our operating results were impacted by geopolitical and macroeconomic events, causing supply chain challenges and significantly increased commodity and wage inflation. Our commodity and wage inflationary environment began returning to more historical levels in fiscal 2024.
The impact of ongoing geopolitical and macroeconomic events could lead to further wage inflation, product and services cost inflation, disruptions in the supply chain, staffing challenges, shifts in consumer behavior, and delays in new restaurant openings. Adverse weather conditions and natural disasters may further exacerbate a number of these factors. Any of these factors may have an adverse impact on our business and materially adversely affect our financial performance. 
The Cheesecake Factory
As of February 24, 2025, we operated 215 The Cheesecake Factory restaurants, which strive to provide a distinctive, high-quality dining experience at moderate prices by offering an extensive, innovative and evolving menu in an upscale casual, high-energy setting with attentive, efficient and friendly service. As a result, The Cheesecake Factory restaurants appeal to a diverse customer base across a broad demographic range. Our extensive menu and strategic selection of locations enable us to compete for substantially all dining preferences and occasions, from the key lunch and dinner day parts to the mid-afternoon and late-night day parts, which are traditionally weaker times for most casual dining restaurants, as well as special occasion dining. The Cheesecake Factory restaurants are generally open seven days a week for lunch and dinner, and we offer additional menu items for weekend brunch. 
All of our restaurants offer a full-service bar where our entire menu is served. During fiscal 2024, alcoholic beverage sales represented 11% of The Cheesecake Factory restaurant sales. We offer all items on our menu, except alcoholic beverages where disallowed by regulation, for off-premise consumption, sales of which comprised approximately 21% of The Cheesecake Factory restaurant sales during fiscal 2024. We work with a third party to provide delivery service from all of our locations and offer online ordering for to-go sales at all of our domestic locations. 
The Cheesecake Factory menu features approximately 225 items, exclusive of beverage and dessert items and including items presented on supplemental menus, such as our SkinnyLicious
®
 menu that offers innovative items at 590 calories or less. Our menu

Table of Contents
offerings include appetizers, pizza, seafood, steaks, chicken, burgers, small plates, pastas, salads, sandwiches and omelettes, including a selection of vegan and gluten-free items.
Our ability to create, promote and attractively display our unique line of desserts is also important to the competitive positioning and financial success of our restaurants. We offer approximately 45 varieties of proprietary cheesecake and other desserts in our restaurants. Our brand identity and reputation for offering premium desserts results in a significant level of dessert sales, representing approximately 17% of The Cheesecake Factory sales during fiscal 2024.
Competitive Positioning
The restaurant industry is comprised of multiple segments, including fine dining, casual dining, fast casual and quick-service. The Cheesecake Factory restaurants operate in the upscale casual dining segment, which is positioned above core casual dining, with standards that are closer to fine dining. Upscale casual dining is differentiated by freshly prepared and innovative food, flavorful recipes with creative presentations, unique restaurant layouts, eye-catching design elements and more personalized service. We believe that we are a leader in upscale casual dining given the historically high average sales per square foot of our restaurants as compared to others in this segment.
The restaurant industry is highly competitive with respect to menu and food quality, service, personnel, location, décor and value. We compete directly and indirectly with national and regional casual dining restaurant chains, as well as independently-owned restaurants. In addition, we face competition from fast casual and quick-service restaurants, grocery stores and meal kits that have increased the quality and variety of their food products in response to consumer demand. We also compete with other restaurants and retail establishments for quality sites and staff and managers to operate our restaurants.
The key elements that drive our total customer experience and help position us from a competitive standpoint include the following:
Extensive and Innovative Menu, Made Fresh from Scratch.
 Our restaurants offer one of the broadest menus in upscale casual dining and feature a wide array of flavors with portions designed for sharing. In contrast to many restaurant chains, substantially all of our menu items, except those desserts produced at our bakery facilities, are prepared from scratch daily at our restaurants with high-quality, fresh ingredients using innovative and proprietary recipes. We believe one of our competitive strengths is our ability to anticipate customer preferences and adapt our expansive menu to the latest trends. We regularly update our ingredients and cooking methods, as well as create new menu items and new categories of food offerings at our restaurants, further enhancing the variety, quality and price points offered and keeping our menu relevant to our customers. All new menu items are selected based on anticipated sales popularity and profitability. We also regularly introduce new and innovative cheesecakes and other baked desserts. In 2024, we launched the Triple Berry Bliss Cheesecake in conjunction with National Cheesecake Day.
We generally update The Cheesecake Factory menus twice each year, and our philosophy is to use price increases to help offset key operating cost increases in a manner that balances supporting both our margin objectives and customer traffic levels. Prior to fiscal 2022, we targeted menu price increases of approximately 2% to 3% annually, utilizing a market-based strategy to help mitigate cost pressure in higher-wage geographies. In the last three fiscal years, we implemented price increases above our historical levels, to help offset inflationary cost pressures. We will continue to take the cost and inflationary environment into consideration when implementing future pricing decisions. In addition, on a regular basis, we carefully consider opportunities to adjust our menu offerings or ingredients to help manage product availability and cost. 
Value Proposition.
 We believe our restaurants are recognized by customers for offering value with a large variety of freshly prepared menu items across a broad array of price points and generous portions at moderate prices. The average check for each customer, including beverages and desserts, was approximately $31.05 during fiscal 2024.

Commitment to Excellent Service and Hospitality through the Selection, Training and Retention of High-Quality Staff Members.
 Our mission is to “create an environment where absolute guest satisfaction is our highest priority.” We strive to consistently exceed the expectations of our customers in all aspects of their experiences in our restaurants. One of the most important aspects of delivering a consistent and dependable level of service is having a team of experienced managers who can successfully operate our high-volume, complex restaurants. Our recruitment, selection, training, retention and internal promotion programs are among the most comprehensive in the restaurant industry, helping us to attract and retain qualified staff members who are motivated to consistently provide excellence in restauranteuring and customer hospitality. By providing extensive training, our goal is to encourage our staff members to develop a sense of personal commitment to our core values and culture of excellence. (See “Restaurant Operations, Development and Training” below.) Our commitment to people-focused programs and creating a great workplace for all of our staff and managers contributed to The Cheesecake Factory being named to Fortune magazine’s list of “100 Best Companies to Work For
®
” in 2024, for the eleventh consecutive year.
High-Quality, High-Profile Restaurant Locations and Flexible Site Layouts.
 We target restaurant sites in high-quality, high-profile locations with a balanced mix of retail shopping, entertainment, residences, tourism and businesses. We have the flexibility to design our restaurants to accommodate a wide array of urban and suburban site layouts, including multi-level locations. Our restaurants feature large, open dining areas, high ceilings where available, a contemporary kitchen design and a bakery counter that features our desserts while also serving as a strategic location to facilitate our off-premise sales. The layouts are flexible, permitting tables and seats to be easily rearranged to accommodate small and large parties, thus permitting more effective utilization of seating capacity. Interior and exterior patio seating, either or both of which are available at approximately 95% of our restaurants, allow for additional customer capacity at a comparatively low occupancy cost per seat. Exterior patio seating is generally available as weather permits. (See “New Restaurant Site Selection and Development” below.)
Distinctive Restaurant Design and Decor.
 We place significant emphasis on the contemporary interior design and decor of our restaurants, which create a high-energy ambiance in a casual setting and contribute to the distinctive dining experience enjoyed by our customers. We have evolved our restaurants’ design over time to remain current while retaining a similar look and feel to our earlier restaurants. Our restaurants feature large, open dining areas, and where feasible, both exterior and interior patios. We apply high standards to the maintenance of our restaurants to keep them in “like new” condition.
Integration of our Bakery Operations.
 The primary role of our bakery operations is to produce innovative, high-quality cheesecakes and other baked desserts for sale at The Cheesecake Factory restaurants and those of our international licensees, which is important to our competitive positioning. Integration of this vital part of our brand gives us control over the creativity and quality of our desserts and is also more profitable than buying from a third party.
New Restaurant Site Selection and Development
The Cheesecake Factory concept has demonstrated success in a variety of layouts (e.g., single or multi-level and varying interior square feet), site locations (e.g., urban or suburban shopping malls, lifestyle centers, retail strip centers, office complexes, entertainment centers and urban street locations — either freestanding or in-line) and trade areas. Accordingly, we intend to continue developing The Cheesecake Factory restaurants in high-quality, high-profile locations that meet our rigorous site standards. In accordance with our broader capital allocation strategy, we plan to open as many locations in any given year as there are sites available that meet our site selection criteria and for which we can negotiate acceptable lease terms, obtain necessary permits, complete construction, and recruit and train personnel. We have the flexibility in our restaurant designs to penetrate a wide variety of markets across varying population densities in both existing and new markets. We continue to target approximately 300 Company-owned and operated The Cheesecake Factory restaurants domestically over time.
The locations of our restaurants are critical to our long-term success, and we devote significant time and resources to analyzing each prospective site. We consider many factors when assessing the suitability of a site, including the demographics of the trade area such as average household income and population density, as well as site-specific characteristics such as visibility, accessibility and proximity to activity centers such as shopping centers and competitive influences. Because our restaurants can be successfully executed within a variety of site locations and layouts, we are highly flexible in choosing suitable locations. While there are common decor elements within each of our restaurant sites, the designs are customized for the specifics of each location, including the building type, square footage and layout of available space. We expect the majority of our new restaurants to vary between 7,000 and 10,000 interior square feet, generally with additional exterior and/or interior patio seating, selected appropriately for each market and specific site.

Table of Contents
We believe the relatively high sales productivity of our restaurants provides opportunities to obtain competitive leasing terms from landlords. Due to the flexible and customized nature of our restaurant operations and the complex design, construction and preopening processes for each new location, our lease negotiation and restaurant development time frames vary. The development and opening process usually ranges from six to eighteen months, depending largely on the type and availability of the leased space we intend to occupy, our preferred opening date, as well as our ability to obtain goods, materials, permits and adequate staffing, and a variety of other circumstances beyond our control.
Unit Economics
We believe the operation of high-quality restaurants in premier locations fitting our criteria contributes to the continuing customer appeal of The Cheesecake Factory. This popularity is reflected in our average sales per restaurant and per square foot, which are among the highest of any publicly-held full service restaurant company.
Average sales per location for The Cheesecake Factory restaurants open for the full year were approximately $12.4 million for fiscal 2024. Because each of our restaurants has a customized layout and differs in size, an effective method to measure the unit economics of our sites is by square foot. Average sales per productive square foot (defined as all interior square footage plus seasonally adjusted exterior patio square footage) for restaurants open for the full year were approximately $1,152 for fiscal 2024. Fluctuations in both average sales per location and average sales per productive square foot for fiscal 2024 generally tracked with comparable restaurant sales trends. 
We currently lease all of our restaurant locations and utilize capital for leasehold improvements and furnishings, fixtures and equipment to build out our restaurant premises. Our distinctive design and decor require a higher investment per square foot than is typical for the upscale casual dining industry. However, our restaurants have historically generated annual sales per square foot that are also typically higher than our competitors. Total construction costs to build our restaurant premises average approximately $1,100 per interior square foot. However, these costs vary depending on a number of factors, including geography, the complexity of our build-out, site characteristics, governmental fees and permits, labor and material conditions in the local market, weather and the amount, if any, of construction contributions obtained from our landlords for structural additions and other leasehold improvements.
Our new restaurants have typically opened with initial sales volumes well in excess of their future run-rate levels. This initial “honeymoon” effect usually results from grand opening publicity and other customer awareness activities that generate higher than usual customer traffic, particularly in new markets. During the three to six months following the opening of new restaurants, customer traffic has generally settled into its normal pattern, resulting in sales volumes that gradually adjust downward to their post-opening run-rate level. Additionally, our new restaurants have typically required a period of time after reaching normal traffic levels to achieve their targeted restaurant-level margins due to actual-to-theoretical food cost inefficiencies and labor productivity inefficiencies commonly associated with new, highly complex restaurants such as ours.
Restaurant Operations
Our ability to consistently execute a complex menu offering items prepared daily with high-quality, fresh ingredients in an upscale casual, high-volume dining environment is critical to our overall success. We employ detailed operating procedures, standards, controls, food line management systems and cooking methods and processes designed to accommodate our extensive menu and to drive sales productivity.
We believe that the high average sales volumes and popularity of our restaurants allow us to attract and retain high-quality, experienced restaurant-level management and other operational personnel. Each restaurant is generally staffed with a General Manager (“GM”) and an Executive Kitchen Manager (“EKM”), who possess an average of more than ten years of experience with the Company. We believe this tenure and knowledge drive our high productivity and contribute to our ability to deliver an exceptional customer experience.
To enable us to more effectively compete for, and retain, the highest quality restaurant management personnel, we offer an innovative and comprehensive compensation program for our restaurant GMs and EKMs. Each participant receives a competitive base salary and has the opportunity to earn a cash bonus based on quantitative restaurant performance metrics. GMs are also eligible to use a Company-leased vehicle. In addition, we provide a longer-term, equity incentive program to our GMs and EKMs based on their extended service with us in their respective positions and their achievement of certain performance objectives. We believe that these awards encourage our GMs and EKMs to think and act as business owners, assist in retention of restaurant management and align our managers’ interests with those of our stockholders.

Restaurant-Level Preopening Costs
Due to the highly customized and operationally complex nature of our upscale, high-volume concept and the investment we make in properly training our staff to operate our restaurants, our preopening process is more extensive, time consuming and costly than that of many restaurant chains. Restaurant-level preopening costs for a typical location in an established market average approximately $1.0 million to $1.5 million and include all costs to relocate and compensate restaurant management staff members during the preopening period, costs to recruit and train hourly restaurant staff members, and wages, travel and lodging costs for our opening training team and other support staff members.
Restaurant-level preopening costs can fluctuate significantly from period to period, based on the number and timing of restaurant openings and the specific costs incurred for each restaurant. These costs vary by location depending on a number of factors, including the proximity of our existing restaurants, the size and physical layout of each location, the number of management and hourly staff members required to operate each restaurant, the availability of qualified restaurant staff members, the cost of travel and lodging for different metropolitan areas, the timing of the restaurant opening and the extent of unexpected delays, if any, in obtaining final licenses and permits to open the restaurant, which may also depend on our landlords obtaining their licenses and permits and completing their construction activities. Restaurant-level preopening costs are generally higher for larger restaurants and initial entry into new markets and lower when we relocate a restaurant within its local market. We have typically incurred the most significant portion of restaurant-level preopening costs within the two months immediately preceding and the month of a restaurant’s opening.
Licensed Locations
We currently have licensing agreements with three restaurant operators to develop and operate The Cheesecake Factory
®
 brand restaurants in selected international markets. Our licensees invest their capital to build and operate the restaurants, and we receive initial development fees, site and design fees and ongoing royalties based on our licensees’ restaurant sales. In addition, these licensees purchase bakery products branded under The Cheesecake Factory

As we evaluate other international markets, we may consider opportunities to directly operate certain locations and/or enter into licensing, joint venture or partnership arrangements with established third-party companies.
Due to the complexities of opening The Cheesecake Factory restaurants in other countries, including, but not limited to, the selection and design of appropriate sites, construction of our complex restaurant designs, training of licensees’ staff members, approval of supply sources and exportation of our bakery products to new countries, the number and timing of new openings in foreign countries may vary from expectations.
Consumer Packaged Goods
Given the strong affinity for The Cheesecake Factory
®
 brand, we leverage opportunities in the consumer packaged goods channel by partnering with various third-party manufacturers to offer a variety of products marketed under The Cheesecake Factory At Home
®
 mark, including our Famous “Brown Bread,” which is available in select retail stores nationwide.
North Italia 
North Italia is a modern interpretation of Italian cooking in the upscale casual dining segment. North Italia strives to be a modern Italian restaurant with a neighborhood feel, offering classic Italian favorites with a fresh twist made from scratch daily. Contemporary design and décor elements including large dining rooms, high ceilings and open kitchen layouts coupled with a focus on exceptional hospitality and high-quality, personalized service creates a warm, lively atmosphere for guests to create memorable experiences. The menu features a broad selection of delicious, handcrafted dishes including appetizers, salads, fresh pastas, pizzas and entrees, and each restaurant includes unique menu items tailored to local markets. North Italia offers an assortment of wines, beers and house-made cocktails which represented 23% of North Italia sales in fiscal 2024. The average check for each customer, including beverages and desserts, for fiscal 2024 averaged approximately $34.60 for lunch and approximately $44.40 for dinner. Our North Italia restaurants are generally open seven days a week for lunch, dinner and offer weekend brunch. Currently, we operate 43 North Italia restaurants. 
With Italian cuisine being one of the most popular ethnic food categories in the United States, coupled with strong national reception of the North Italia concept to-date, we believe there is potential for approximately 200 domestic locations over time, which supports our plan for approximately 20% average annual unit growth. Average sales per location open for the full year for North Italia restaurants were approximately $7.7 million for fiscal 2024, or approximately $1,100 per productive square foot. We target an average North Italia unit size of 6,000 to 7,000 interior square feet and average total construction costs of approximately $800 per interior square foot. In fiscal years 2023 and 2024, we incurred higher construction costs, however we anticipate future costs to return to our targeted levels. Restaurant-level preopening costs for a typical location in an established market average approximately $0.6 million to $0.8 million and include all costs to relocate and compensate restaurant management staff members during the preopening period, costs to recruit and train hourly restaurant staff members, and wages, travel and lodging costs for our opening training team and other support staff members.

Flower Child
Flower Child operates in the fast casual dining segment, offering a customizable menu, made fresh from scratch, featuring locally-sourced, all-natural and organic ingredients. We believe Flower Child provides us an opportunity to diversify our portfolio in a strong and growing niche. Currently, we operate 38 Flower Child locations and believe there is potential for approximately 700 domestic locations over time, which supports our plan for approximately 20% average annual unit growth for this concept. Average sales per location open for the full year for the Flower Child restaurants were approximately $4.3 million for fiscal 2024, or approximately $1,200 per interior square foot. We target an average Flower Child unit size of 3,000 to 4,000 interior square feet and average total construction costs of approximately $750 per interior square foot.
Fox Restaurant Concepts (“FRC”)
FRC operates as an independent subsidiary based in Phoenix, Arizona and serves as an incubator, innovating new food, dining and hospitality experiences to create fresh, exciting concepts. With over a dozen evolving restaurant brands launched to-date, its concepts are diverse in industry segment, occasions, square footage and geography. Other FRC potential growth concepts include Culinary Dropout, The Henry and Blanco, which together with the other FRC brands, serve as an ecosystem for talent, menu and design development. Currently, we operate 49 Other FRC locations. We target approximately 10% to 15% average annual unit growth for the aggregate Other FRC portfolio, complemented by additional market tests of the potential growth concepts. Average sales per location open for the full year for the Other FRC restaurants were approximately $6.4 million for fiscal 2024, or approximately $1,100 per interior square foot. We target an average FRC unit size of 3,500 to 15,000 interior square feet and average total construction costs of approximately $700 per interior square foot, depending on the concept.
Bakery Operations
We own and operate two bakery production facilities, one in Calabasas Hills, California, and one in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. Our facility in California accommodates both production operations and corporate support personnel, while our facility in North Carolina houses production operations and a distribution center. We are evaluating beginning construction on a third bakery production facility in Charlestown, Indiana in fiscal 2025 or fiscal 2026. We produce approximately 60 varieties of proprietary cheesecakes and other baked desserts using high-quality ingredients for The Cheesecake Factory restaurants and for international licensees and third-party customers.
The primary role of our bakery operations is to produce innovative, high-quality cheesecakes and other baked desserts for sale at our restaurants and those of our international licensees. Integration of this vital part of our brand gives us control over the creativity and quality of our desserts and is also more profitable than buying from a third party. We also leverage The Cheesecake Factory brand identity and utilize our bakery production capacity by selling cheesecakes and other baked products to external foodservice operators, retailers and distributors. Current large-account customers include retail and supermarkets, foodservice distributors and operators, a national retail bookstore, other restaurants and national warehouse clubs. Items produced for outside accounts are marketed under The Cheesecake Factory At Home
®
 and The Cheesecake Factory Bakery
®
 marks, as well as private labels.
We sell baked goods internationally in approximately 15 countries under The Cheesecake Factory At Home
®
 mark. Offering our cheesecakes and other baked desserts internationally is important to our branding, creating awareness and driving demand for both our bakery products and the international expansion of our restaurants.
Human Capital
Our ability to attract highly motivated staff members and retain an engaged, experienced team is key to successful execution of our strategy. While we continue to operate in a competitive labor environment, we believe our people practices contribute significantly to our ability to attract talent and to The Cheesecake Factory restaurants’ historically industry-leading retention rates. Retention and engagement of our staff members is fostered by our investment particularly in the following areas:
Culture
Cultivating and maintaining our culture is a key strategic focus. Our core values and purpose reflect who we are and how our staff members interact with one another, as well as with our customers. 
10

Table of Contents
We believe our efforts to build and maintain a strong culture have contributed to two notable recognitions in 2024. We were named to the FORTUNE 100 Best Companies to Work For
®
 list for an eleventh consecutive year and the PEOPLE Companies that Care
®
 list for a fourth consecutive year.
Development and Training
We provide our staff with career advancement opportunities, and our fiscal 2024 combined internal management promotion rate at The Cheesecake Factory and North Italia concepts was 45%. Our hourly staff members and managers receive a considerable amount of training through a combination of in-person learning and development and online coursework. In addition to company-provided job training, we offer hourly staff members of The Cheesecake Factory and North Italia restaurants free high school equivalency and associate degree programs. We also offer a limited education reimbursement to our staff seeking post-secondary education.
Total Rewards
We offer healthcare benefits to our hourly staff members who work a minimum of 25 hours per week, on average. We provide a competitive suite of benefits and wellness offerings. The Cheesecake Factory and North Italia staff, as well as our bakery and corporate teams, have paid sick time available to them starting at hire and are eligible to earn vacation time.
Employee Engagement
As of December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 47,900 people, with approximately 46,350 in our restaurants and the remainder in our corporate support center, FRC headquarters and bakery operations. We believe that engaging our workforce is a key factor in our business success and in turn, have developed programs to promote enthusiasm and commitment. We measure our performance in this area through an annual engagement survey and pulse surveys throughout the year. 
A significant part of our employee engagement strategy involves staff appreciation and recognition efforts. We hold key company cultural events such as our week-long team appreciation celebrations, manager recognitions, Commitment to Excellence staff member awards and new menu rollout all-staff meetings.
Our staff members are not covered by any collective bargaining agreements.
Giving Back 
Another key aspect of our culture is giving back to the communities where our staff live and work, as well as uniting our staff members around charitable causes personal to them. We donate to Feeding America and participate in their annual campaign as an opportunity to engage our teams in a company-wide service program. We promote our teams’ participation in community volunteer events, and through our gift card program, we contribute to local fundraising events for community non-profit organizations. 
We also participate in a nationwide food donation program which redirects surplus food away from landfills to local food banks and non-profit organizations. Additionally, we provide a method for our staff members to assist other staff members in need through our The Cheesecake Factory “HELP” fund.

Purchasing and Distribution
Our purchasing philosophy is designed to procure quality ingredients, supplies and services for our operations from reliable sources consistent with our sustainability goals. In order to maximize purchasing efficiencies and to obtain the freshest ingredients that meet our required standards, each restaurant’s management determines the quantities of food and supplies needed for their location and orders the items from local, regional, national and international suppliers based upon specifications determined and terms negotiated at a corporate level. We strive to maintain restaurant-level inventories at a minimum dollar level in relation to sales due to 
11

Table of Contents
the relatively rapid turnover of the perishable commodities we use in our operations, coupled with the limited storage space at our restaurants. 
The cost of products and services used in our operations are subject to volatility due to the relative availability of labor and distribution, weather, natural disasters, inventory levels and other supply and/or demand impacting events such as geopolitical events, economic conditions, public health emergencies or other unforeseen circumstances. Adverse weather conditions and natural disasters may further exacerbate a number of these factors. In recent years, we were impacted by geopolitical and macroeconomic events, causing supply chain challenges and significantly increased commodity prices. Our commodity environment began returning to more historical levels in fiscal 2024.
We attempt to negotiate short-term and long-term agreements for some of our principal commodity, supply and equipment requirements, such as certain dairy products and poultry, depending on market conditions and expected demand. While we are in the process of contracting for certain key food and non-food supplies for fiscal 2025, these efforts may not be successful or yield our intended benefits. We continue to evaluate the possibility of entering into similar arrangements for other commodities and periodically evaluate hedging vehicles, such as direct financial instruments, to assist us in managing risk and variability associated with such commodities. As of the end of fiscal 2024, we had no financial hedging contracts in place. 
Information Technology
Our technology-enabled business solutions are designed to provide effective financial controls, cost management, improved efficiencies and enhanced customer experience. Our business intelligence solution and data warehouse architecture provide corporate and restaurant management with information and insights into key operational metrics and performance indicators. This framework delivers enterprise reporting, dashboards and analytics, and allows access to metrics such as quote and wait time accuracy, staff member retention trends, and restaurant quality and service analyses.
Our restaurant systems are designed to enhance the guest experience, protect guest information and allow our staff to focus on delivering the best experience possible. We have implemented systems for touchless/online menu, ordering and payment, inventory management, labor management, recipe management, kitchen order orchestration and table management. Our kitchen order orchestration tool is designed to route items in such a way that balances the workload across multiple stations to ensure our guests receive the highest quality menu items. Our labor management tool delivers optimized scheduling based on business demands and staff availability coupled with web and app-based access delivering flexibility to our staff. 
Our information security and cybersecurity efforts are led by a multi-disciplinary security team, overseen by our interdepartmental Information Security Council representing our key functional areas. We have developed and implemented a cybersecurity risk management program intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our critical systems and information. We remain focused on protecting against new and emerging risks utilizing our tools and security teams and continue to review and make strategic investments in our systems intended to help keep the Company’s, our guests’, and our team members’ data secure. (See Item 1C – Cybersecurity of this report for further discussion on our cybersecurity.) 
Marketing and Advertising
The Cheesecake Factory
We rely on our reputation, as well as our high-profile locations, media exposure and positive “word of mouth” to maintain and grow market share. Historically, we have not used significant paid national advertising through television, radio or print, nor significant discounting for on-premise dining occasions. We utilize a social media and digital marketing strategy that allows us to engage regularly with our customers outside of our restaurants, including communication and paid advertising on social media platforms such as Instagram
®
 and Facebook
®
, influencer marketing, Google advertising and direct email to customers. We launched our Cheesecake Rewards

 program nationally in mid-2023 with the objective to leverage data analytics and insights to engage more effectively with our guests and drive incremental sales while maintaining our restaurant level margins.
Public relations is another important aspect of our marketing approach, and we frequently appear on local and national television in connection with a variety of promotional opportunities, such as National Cheesecake Day, to perform cooking demonstrations and other brand-building exposure. We generated approximately 21.8 billion media impressions in fiscal 2024 at minimal cost to us. To raise awareness in the off-premise channel, we execute marketing campaigns with our third-party delivery provider and through our online ordering platform. In addition, we work with several premiere third-party gift card distributors,

contributing to our brand awareness and gift card sales, as well as our consumer packaged goods licensees on co-branded marketing campaigns.
North Italia, Flower Child and Other FRC
North Italia, Flower Child and Other FRC execute localized marketing programs focused on awareness, frequency and brand engagement through a variety of channels, including store-level marketing, public relations, in-store events, digital advertising, email programs and social media. Each restaurant is positioned as an individual brand with a neighborhood connection. Additionally, the restaurant interiors and exteriors are utilized for brand engagement and messaging through art and graphics, creating an important part of a brand experience for the customer.
Seasonality and Quarterly Results
While seasonal fluctuations generally do not have a material impact on our quarterly results, year-over-year comparisons can be significantly impacted by factors such as significant differences in year-over-year inflation, the number and timing of new restaurant openings and associated preopening costs, the timing of holidays, inclement weather and the additional week in a 53-week fiscal year. Therefore, our financial results for any quarter or fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year or subsequent fiscal years.
Food Safety and Quality Assurance
Our food safety processes and systems are designed to mitigate the risk of contamination and illness and to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements as well as industry standards. Adherence is monitored through routine restaurant management reviews, third-party health inspection/food safety audits and regulatory agency inspections. In addition, our bakery facilities are Safe Quality Food certified in alignment with the Global Food Safety Initiative’s Global Markets Program. Our restaurants and bakery facilities are subject to regulatory guidelines required for conducting and managing ingredient and product traceability. We utilize a web-based solution to efficiently contact our restaurants and monitor progress in the event of a product withdrawal or recall. Web-based solutions are also used for tracking regulatory compliance and implementing corrective actions
In selecting suppliers, we utilize key performance indicators relating to sanitation, operations and facility management, good manufacturing and agricultural practices, product protection, government inspections and compliance, recovery and food security. We perform annual food safety and quality system audits for certain suppliers, while others are audited every other year or as needed. A web-based solution is utilized for incident management, reporting and compliance of our suppliers.
Government Laws and Regulations
Our Company is subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. Each of our restaurants is subject to various laws and regulations, including license and permit requirements, that regulate many aspects of our business, including, among other things, alcoholic beverage control, health, sanitation, labor, immigration, zoning and public safety. We are also subject to various environmental regulations governing areas such as water usage, sanitation disposal and transportation mitigation.
Our international business exposes us to additional laws and regulations, including, without limitation, antitrust and tax requirements, anti-boycott legislation, import/export and customs regulations and other international trade regulations, privacy laws that may differ from U.S. privacy laws, anti-terrorism laws and anti-corruption laws.
As a provider of food products, we are subject to a comprehensive regulatory framework that governs the manufacture (including composition and ingredients), labeling, packaging and safety of food.
In order to serve alcoholic beverages in our restaurants or off-premise where permitted, we must comply with alcoholic beverage control regulations which require us to apply to a state and/or other governmental alcoholic beverage control authority for licenses and permits. In addition, we are subject to dram shop statutes in most of the jurisdictions in which we operate, which generally provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person. Dram shop litigation may result in significant judgments, including punitive damages. We attempt to mitigate this risk by carrying liquor liability insurance coverage.
