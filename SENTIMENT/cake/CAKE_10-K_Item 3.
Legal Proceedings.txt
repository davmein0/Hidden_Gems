In connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the Acts, we have identified and are disclosing important factors, risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements made by us, or on our behalf. (See Item 1A — Risk Factors.) These cautionary statements are to be used as a reference in connection with any forward-looking statements. The factors, risks and uncertainties identified in these cautionary statements are in addition to those contained in any other cautionary statements, written or oral, which may be made or otherwise addressed in connection with a forward-looking statement or contained in any of our subsequent filings with the SEC. Because of these factors, risks and uncertainties, we caution against placing undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Although we believe that the assumptions underlying forward-looking statements are currently reasonable, any of the assumptions could be incorrect or incomplete, and there can be no assurance that forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements or to make any other forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless required to do so by law.
Summary Risk Factors
Our business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. These risks are more fully described in the section titled “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A of this report. These risks include, among others, the following: 
●
The impact global and domestic economic conditions have on consumer discretionary spending and our costs of operations could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
●
Our inability to grow comparable restaurant sales could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
●
If we are unable to protect our reputation, the value of our brands and sales at our restaurants may be negatively impacted.
●
If we are unable to offset higher labor costs, our cost of doing business will significantly increase.
●
Pandemics, epidemics, endemics and other public health emergencies, or food safety and food-borne illness, could reduce customer traffic to our restaurants, disrupt our food supply chain or cause us to be the target of litigation.
●
Changes in, or any failure to comply with, applicable laws or regulations could materially adversely affect our ability to operate our restaurants and/or increase our cost to do so.
●
Labor organizing could harm our operations and competitive position in the restaurant industry.
●
Our inability to respond appropriately to changes in consumer health and disclosure regulations, and to adapt to evolving consumer dining preferences, could negatively impact our operations and competitive position.
●
Our failure to effectively develop, grow and operate North Italia and our other branded concepts could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
●
Adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, climate change and public health emergencies could unfavorably impact our restaurant sales.
●
Acts of violence at or threatened against our restaurants or the centers in which they are located, including civil unrest, customer intimidation, active shooter situations and terrorism, could unfavorably impact our restaurant sales.
●
Our inability to anticipate and react effectively to changes in the costs of key operating resources may increase our cost of doing business.
●
Our financial performance could be materially adversely affected if we fail to retain, or effectively respond to a loss of, key executives.
●
If we are unable to staff and retain qualified restaurant management and operating personnel in an increasingly competitive market, we may be unable to effectively operate and grow our business and revenues.
●
If any of our third-party vendors experiences a failure that affects a significant aspect of our business, we may experience data loss, increased costs, operational disruption or other harm.
●
We may incur additional costs if we are unable to renew our restaurant leases on similar terms and conditions, or at all, or to relocate our restaurants in certain trade areas.
●
Information technology system failures or breaches of our network security could interrupt our operations and subject us to increased operating costs, as well as to litigation and other liabilities.
●
Our inability to maintain a secure environment for customers’ and staff members’ personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation.
●
Our failure to satisfy financial covenants and/or repayment requirements under our credit facility could harm our financial condition.
●
Our convertible senior notes due 2026 and the incurrence of any additional indebtedness could limit the cash flow available for our operations.
