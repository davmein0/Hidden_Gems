Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
 Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

We operate under three reportable segments – Retail, Subscription and Wholesale. Our Retail segment primarily includes our Anthropologie, Free People, FP Movement and Urban Outfitters brands. Our Retail segment products and services are sold directly to our customers through our retail locations, websites, mobile applications, social media and third-party digital platforms, catalogs and customer contact centers and franchisee-owned stores. Our Subscription segment, formerly known as the Nuuly segment, includes the Nuuly brand, which offers customers a more sustainable way to explore fashion primarily through a monthly women’s apparel subscription rental service. Our Wholesale segment includes our Free People, FP Movement and Urban Outfitters brands that sell through department and specialty stores worldwide, digital businesses and our Retail segment. Our Wholesale segment primarily designs, develops and markets apparel, intimates, activewear and shoes.

Our fiscal year ends on January 31. All references to our fiscal years refer to the fiscal years ended on January 31 in those years. For example, our fiscal year 2025 ended on January 31, 2025, our fiscal year 2024 ended on January 31, 2024, and our fiscal year 2023 ended on January 31, 2023.

As used in this document, unless otherwise defined, "Anthropologie" refers to our Anthropologie and Terrain brands and "Free People" refers to our Free People and FP Movement brands.

Retail Segment

Our Retail segment omni-channel strategy enhances our customers’ brand experience by providing a seamless approach to the customer shopping experience. All Company-owned Retail segment shopping channels are closely integrated, including retail locations, websites, mobile applications, catalogs and customer contact centers. Our investments in areas such as marketing campaigns and technology advancements are designed to generate demand for the Retail segment omni-channel and not the separate store or digital channels. We manage and analyze our performance based on a single Retail segment omni-channel rather than separate channels and believe that the Retail segment omni-channel results present the most meaningful and appropriate measure of our performance.

Our comparable Retail segment net sales data is equal to the sum of our comparable store and comparable digital channel net sales. A store is considered to be comparable if it has been open at least 12 full months, unless it was materially expanded or remodeled within that year or was not otherwise operating at its full capacity within that year due to store specific closures from events such as damage from fire, flood and natural weather events. A digital channel is considered to be comparable if it has been operational for at least 12 full months. Sales from stores and digital channels that do not fall within the definition of comparable store or digital channel are considered to be non-comparable. Franchise net sales and the effects of foreign currency translation are also considered non-comparable.

We monitor Retail segment metrics including customer traffic, conversion rates and average units per transaction at our stores and on our websites and mobile applications. We also monitor average unit selling price and transactions at our stores and average order value on our websites and mobile applications. We believe that changes in any of these metrics may be caused by a response to our brands’ fashion offerings, our marketing campaigns, circulation of our catalogs and an overall growth in brand recognition.

The Anthropologie brand tailors its merchandise and inviting store environment to sophisticated and contemporary women aged 28 to 45. The internally designed and third-party brand product assortment includes women’s apparel, accessories, intimates, shoes, furniture, home decor and beauty and wellness. The brand also has a bridal collection consisting of wedding, bridesmaid and party dresses, accessories and decor. The Terrain brand is designed to appeal to women and men interested in a creative and sophisticated outdoor living and gardening experience. Merchandise includes lifestyle home, garden and outdoor living products, antiques, live plants, flowers, wellness products and accessories. Anthropologie stores are located in specialty centers, upscale street locations and enclosed malls. Anthropologie operates websites and mobile applications in North America and Europe that capture the spirit of its brands by offering a similar yet broader selection of merchandise as found in its stores, offers catalogs in North America that markets select merchandise, most of which is also available in Anthropologie brand stores and sells merchandise through franchisee-owned stores in the Middle East. Anthropologie's North American Retail segment net sales accounted for approximately 42.1% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2025, compared to 41.7% for fiscal 2024. European Retail segment net sales accounted for approximately 1.6% of consolidated net sales for both fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024.

The Free People brand focuses its product offering on private label merchandise targeted to young contemporary women aged 25 to 30 and provides a unique merchandise mix of casual women’s apparel, intimates, activewear, shoes, accessories, home products, gifts and beauty and wellness. The FP Movement brand offers performance-ready activewear, beyond-the-gym staples and wellness essentials. Free People stores are located in enclosed malls, upscale street locations and specialty centers. Free People operates websites and mobile applications in North America and Europe that capture the spirit of its brands by offering a similar yet broader selection of merchandise as found in its stores, as well as substantially all of the Free People and FP Movement brands' wholesale offerings. Free People also offers catalogs that market select merchandise, most of which is also available in our Free People stores. Free People's North American Retail segment net sales accounted for approximately 20.7% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2025, compared to

22

approximately 20.1% for fiscal 2024. European Retail segment net sales accounted for approximately 1.0% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2025, compared to less than 1.0% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2024.

Urban Outfitters targets young adults aged 18 to 28 through a unique merchandise mix, compelling store environment, social media and third-party digital platforms, websites and mobile applications and a product offering that includes women’s and men’s fashion apparel, activewear, intimates, footwear, accessories, home goods, electronics and beauty. A large portion of our merchandise is exclusive to Urban Outfitters, consisting of an assortment of products designed internally or designed in collaboration with third-party brands. Urban Outfitters stores are located in street locations in large metropolitan areas and select university communities, specialty centers and enclosed malls that accommodate our customers’ propensity not only to shop, but also to congregate with their peers. Urban Outfitters operates websites and mobile applications in North America and Europe that capture the spirit of the brand by offering a similar yet broader selection of merchandise as found in its stores and sells merchandise through franchisee-owned stores in the Middle East. Urban Outfitters’ North American Retail segment net sales accounted for approximately 14.3%

of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2025, compared to 17.7% for fiscal 2024. European Retail segment net sales accounted for approximately 7.9% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2025, compared to approximately 8.2% for fiscal 2024.

Menus & Venues focuses on a dining and event experience that provides excellence in food, beverage and service. Menus & Venues net sales accounted for less than 1.0% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024.

Net sales from the Retail segment accounted for approximately 88.2%, 90.8% and 92.1% of total consolidated net sales for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Subscription Segment

Our Subscription segment, formerly known as the Nuuly segment, includes the Nuuly brand, which is primarily a monthly women’s apparel subscription rental service. For a monthly fee, Nuuly subscribers can rent product from a wide selection of the Company’s own brands, third-party brands and one-of-a-kind vintage pieces via a custom-built, digital platform. Subscribers select their products each month, wear them as often as they like and then swap into new products the following month. Subscribers are also able to purchase rental product. Net sales from the Subscription segment accounted for approximately 6.8%, 4.6%, and 2.7% of total consolidated net sales for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Wholesale Segment

Our Wholesale segment includes the Free People, FP Movement and Urban Outfitters brands that sell through department and specialty stores worldwide, third-party digital businesses and our Retail segment. The Wholesale segment primarily designs, develops and markets young women’s contemporary casual apparel, intimates, FP Movement activewear and shoes under the Free People and FP Movement brands and the BDG and “iets frans” apparel collections under the Urban Outfitters brand. Net sales from the Wholesale segment accounted for approximately 5.0%, 4.6% and 5.2% of total consolidated net sales for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. These generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses during the reporting period.

Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and require management’s most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ significantly from estimates made, the

24

reported results could be materially affected. We are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would cause our actual results to be materially different from our estimates.

Revenue Recognition

Merchandise: 
Merchandise is sold through retail stores, catalogs and the digital sales channel, as well as to wholesale customers, franchise partners and subscription customers. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods is transferred to the customer. We have elected to treat shipping and handling as fulfillment activities and not a separate performance obligation. Accordingly, we will recognize merchandise revenue for the Retail segment for our single performance obligation at the point of sale, when furniture is delivered or at the time of shipment for non-furniture merchandise, which is when transfer of control to the customer occurs. A subscription customer may purchase merchandise through the Nuuly website or mobile application, which will ship along with their next monthly subscription rental order, and we recognize such merchandise revenue at the time of shipment. A subscription customer may also purchase merchandise in their possession that was delivered as part of the customer's monthly subscription rental order, and we recognize such merchandise revenue when the customer purchases the merchandise through the website or mobile application. Revenue does not include taxes assessed by governmental authorities, including value-added and other sales-related taxes, that are imposed on and concurrent with revenue-producing activities. Revenue is recognized net of estimated customer returns. Uncollectible accounts receivable in the Retail and Subscription segments primarily results from unauthorized credit card transactions. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for our Wholesale segment accounts receivable, which we review on a regular basis and believe is sufficient to cover potential credit losses and billing adjustments. Payment terms in our Wholesale segment vary by customer.

Subscription Fees:
 Revenue for the Subscription segment is primarily generated through monthly subscription fees. The monthly subscription rental fee is recognized over the monthly period over which the customer's monthly subscription fee pertains. The subscription automatically renews on a monthly basis until cancelled or paused by the customer at which point the customer will not be billed for future months until the subscription is no longer paused.

Gift Cards: 
We account for a gift card transaction by recording a liability at the time the gift card is issued to the customer in exchange for consideration from the customer. At the time of issuance, we have an open performance obligation for the future delivery of promised goods or services. The liability remains outstanding until the card is redeemed by the customer, at which time we recognize revenue. Over time, a portion of the outstanding gift cards will not be redeemed by the customer which we refer to as “breakage.” Revenue is recognized from breakage over time in proportion to gift card redemptions. Judgment is used in determining the amount of breakage revenue to be recognized and is based on historical gift card redemption patterns. Gift card breakage revenue is included in net sales and is not material. Our gift cards do not expire.

Sales Return Reserve

We record a sales return reserve for estimated product returns where the sale has occurred during the period reported, but the return is likely to occur subsequent to the period reported. The reserve for estimated product returns is based on our most recent historical return trends. If the actual return rate is materially different than our estimate, sales returns would be adjusted in the future. The costs of returns are recorded as a current asset rather than net with the sales return reserve. As of January 31, 2025, and 2024, reserves for estimated sales returns totaled $90.4

million and $80.5 million, representing 4.4% and 4.0% of total liabilities, respectively.

Inventory

We value our inventory, which consists primarily of general consumer merchandise held for sale, at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined on the first-in, first-out method and includes the cost of merchandise and import-related costs, including freight, import duties and taxes and agent commissions. A periodic review of inventory is performed in order to determine if inventory is properly stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Factors we consider in our review, such as future expected consumer demand and fashion trends, current aging, current and anticipated retail markdowns or wholesale discounts and class or type of inventory, are analyzed to determine estimated net realizable value. Criteria that we consider in our review of aging trends include average selling cycle and seasonality of merchandise, the historical rate at which merchandise has sold below cost during the prior 12 months and the value and nature of merchandise currently held in inventory and priced below original cost. A provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventory to its estimated net realizable value, if appropriate. Any significant unanticipated changes in the factors noted above could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results. Our estimates generally have been accurate, and our reserve methods have been applied on a consistent basis. The majority of inventory at January 31, 2025, and 2024 consisted of finished goods. Raw materials and work-in-process were not material to the overall inventory value. Inventory as of January 31, 2025 and 2024 totaled $621.1

million and $550.2 million, representing 13.7% and 13.4% of total assets, respectively.

Rental Product

The cost of our Subscription segment rental product is amortized to cost of sales over the subscription period based on the cost of each unit rented, which is estimated based on the number of times the unit is expected to be rented and the cost of the rental product.

25

Lost, damaged and retired rental product is also charged to cost of sales. We make assumptions as to the number of times each unit can be rented. If the actual number of times a unit can be rented were to vary significantly from our estimates, it could materially affect the amount of rental product amortization included in cost of sales. Rental product is included in "Other assets" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Purchases of rental product were $175.7 million, $150.7 million, and $103.3 million for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Rental product as of January 31, 2025, and January 31, 2024, totaled $216.1 million and $163.1 million, representing 4.8% and 4.0% of total assets, respectively.

Impairment of Long-lived Assets

We review the carrying values of our definite-lived, long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Events that result in an impairment review include plans to close a retail location, distribution or fulfillment center, a significant decrease in the operating results of a long-lived asset or significant adverse changes in the business climate. Our retail locations are reviewed for impairment at the retail location level, which is the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified. Newly opened retail locations may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results. Factors such as store type (e.g., mall versus free-standing), location (e.g., urban area versus college campus or suburb), current marketplace awareness of our brands, local customer demographic data and current fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required for a retail location to achieve positive financial results. When events indicate that an asset may be impaired and the estimated undiscounted cash flows (based on forecasts of sales and gross profit) are less than the carrying amount of the asset, the impaired asset is adjusted to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recorded. The estimated fair value of the asset or asset group is based on future cash flows of the asset or asset group. For lease right-of-use assets, the Company determines the estimated fair value of the assets by comparing the discounted contractual rent payments to estimated market rent using an acceptable valuation methodology. During fiscal 2025, we recorded impairment charges for one retail location, totaling $0.8 million, with a carrying value after impairment of $1.5 million related to the right-of-use assets. During fiscal 2024, we recorded impairment charges for 15 retail locations, totaling $3.6 million, with a carrying value after impairment of $41.0 million related to the right-of-use assets. During fiscal 2023, we recorded impairment charges for 19 retail locations, totaling $6.4 million, with a carrying value after impairment of $49.0 million related to the right-of-use assets. Additionally, during fiscal 2024 we recorded an asset impairment charge of $6.4 million related to the write-off of "Property and Equipment, net" of the Nuuly Thrift marketplace which the Company wound down in fiscal 2025.

Leases

We have operating leases for stores, distribution and fulfillment centers, corporate offices and equipment that are recognized as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. We sublease certain properties to third parties. We have elected not to record a lease liability and right-of-use asset for leases with original terms of 12 months or less. We have elected the practical expedient to not separate non-lease components from lease components as it pertains to real estate leases.

Store leases generally have initial lease terms that range from 5 to 15 years, some of which contain options to extend the lease for one or two 5-year periods. Payments related to a renewal period are included in the lease liability and right-of-use asset only when we are reasonably certain that we will exercise the option to renew the lease for an extended period of time. Certain leases may contain variable lease payments such as rent based on a percentage of net sales. Variable lease payments may be subject to a breakpoint threshold of fixed rent. Variable lease payments, other than those that depend on an index or a rate, are not included in the measurement of the lease liability. The lease liability is calculated at the present value of certain future payments, discounted using our incremental borrowing rate, which approximates the rate of interest we would pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a fully collateralized basis over a similar term. Significant judgment is used in determining the incremental borrowing rate related to estimates for credit rating, credit spread and the impact of collateral. We developed incremental borrowing rates at a lease portfolio level. The right-of-use asset is initially equal to the value of the lease liability less any amounts received from the landlord as incentives or tenant improvement allowances.

Accounting for Income Taxes

As part of the process of preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes, such as depreciation of property and equipment and valuation of inventories. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all material available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of recent operations. Actual results could differ from this assessment if adequate taxable income is not generated in future periods. Net deferred tax assets as of January 31, 2025, and January 31, 2024, totaled $48.5

million and $46.2 million, respectively, representing 1.1% of total assets as of both January 31, 2025, and January 31, 2024.

26

To the extent we believe that recovery of a deferred tax asset is at risk, we establish valuation allowances. To the extent we establish valuation allowances or increase the allowances in a period, we record additional income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Valuation allowances were $32.5

million as of January 31, 2025, and $32.0 million as of January 31, 2024. Valuation allowances are based on evidence of our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in certain foreign and state jurisdictions. In the future, if enough evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in these jurisdictions becomes apparent, we would be required to reduce our valuation allowances, resulting in a reduction in “Income tax expense” in the Consolidated Statements of Income. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates the likelihood that we will realize the deferred tax assets and adjusts the valuation allowances, if appropriate.

We consider certain earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the United States on the basis of estimates that future United States cash generation will be sufficient to meet future United States cash needs and our specific plans for reinvestment of those subsidiaries’ earnings. Should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings, we would need to adjust our income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside the United States.

During fiscal 2024, we recorded store impairment charges for 15 retail locations and lease abandonment charges for 2 retail locations, totaling $11.9 million. During fiscal 2023, we recorded store impairment charges for 19 retail locations, totaling $6.4 million. 

(2)
During fiscal 2024, we recorded a charge of $6.4 million related to the write-off of "Property and equipment, net" of the Nuuly Thrift marketplace which the Company wound down in fiscal 2025.

Fiscal 2025 Compared to Fiscal 2024

Net sales in fiscal 2025 increased by 7.7% to $5.55 billion, from $5.15 billion in fiscal 2024. The $397.4 million increase was attributable to a $218.0 million, or 4.7%, increase in Retail segment net sales, a $142.5 million, or 60.4%, increase in Subscription segment net sales and a $36.9 million, or 15.5%, increase in Wholesale segment net sales.

28

The increase in our Retail segment net sales during fiscal 2025 was due to an increase of $151.2 million, or 3.4%, in Retail segment comparable net sales and an increase of $66.8 million in non-comparable net sales. Retail segment comparable net sales increased 8.9% at Free People and 7.7% at Anthropologie and decreased 8.7% at Urban Outfitters. Retail segment comparable net sales increased in both North America and Europe. The overall increase in Retail segment comparable net sales was driven by mid single-digit positive growth in digital channel sales and low single-digit positive growth in retail store sales. The digital channel net sales increase was driven by increases in sessions, while average order value decreased. Conversion rate and units per transaction were flat. Comparable retail store net sales increased as a result of higher store traffic and transactions, which were partially offset by a decrease in units per transaction. Conversion rate and average unit retail price were flat. The increase in non-comparable net sales during fiscal 2025 was due to the impact of the 33 net new Company-owned stores and restaurants opened since the prior comparable period and the positive impact of foreign currency translation.

The increase in Subscription segment net sales during fiscal 2025 was primarily driven by a 51.3% increase in average active subscribers in the current year versus the prior year period. The increase in Wholesale segment net sales in fiscal 2025 was driven by a $39.1 million, or 17.9%, increase in Free People wholesale sales primarily due to increases in sales to specialty customers and department stores, partially offset by a decrease of $2.2 million in Urban Outfitters wholesale sales.

Gross profit percentage for fiscal 2025 increased to 34.7% of net sales, from 33.3% of net sales in fiscal 2024. Gross profit increased to $1.93 billion for fiscal 2025 from $1.72 billion in fiscal 2024. The increase in gross profit rate was primarily due to higher initial merchandise markups for all segments primarily driven by Company cross-functional initiatives. The increase in gross profit dollars was due to higher net sales and the improved gross profit rate. Additionally, the Company recorded $4.6 million of store impairment and lease abandonment charges during fiscal 2025, and $11.9 million of store impairment and lease abandonment charges during fiscal 2024.

Total inventory at January 31, 2025 increased by $70.9 million, or 12.9%, to $621.1 million from $550.2 million at January 31, 2024. Total Retail segment inventory increased 10.1%. Retail segment comparable inventory increased 11.3%. Wholesale segment inventory increased 43.7%. The increase in inventory for both segments was to support increased sales and planned early receipts.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $113.7 million, or 8.5%, compared to the prior year, and expressed as a percentage of net sales, deleveraged 19 basis points. The deleverage in selling, general and administrative expenses as a rate to sales was primarily related to increased marketing expenses to support customer growth and increased sales in the Retail and Subscription segments. The dollar growth in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily related to increased marketing expenses to support customer growth and increased sales in the Retail and Subscription segments, as well as increased store payroll expenses to support the growth in Retail segment store net sales.

Income from operations for fiscal 2025 was 8.5% of net sales, or $473.8 million, compared to 7.2% of net sales, or $369.8 million, for fiscal 2024. The increase in operating income dollars was primarily driven by the increase in gross profit. The increase in operating income rate was primarily due to the higher gross profit rate.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2025 was 19.5% compared to 24.6% in fiscal 2024. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the tax benefit from the release of a portion of our income tax reserves as a result of a lapse of the statute of limitations for federal tax purposes. See Note 10, “Income Taxes,” in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate.

Fiscal 2024 Compared to Fiscal 2023

Net sales in fiscal 2024 increased 7.5% to $5.15 billion, from $4.80 billion in fiscal 2023. The $358.0 million increase was attributable to a $263.4 million, or 6.0%, increase in Retail segment net sales and an increase in Subscription segment net sales of $106.2 million, or 81.9%, partially offset by a $11.6 million, or 4.6%, decrease in Wholesale segment net sales.

The increase in our Retail segment net sales during fiscal 2024 was due to an increase of $214.7 million, or 5.0%, in Retail segment comparable net sales and an increase of $48.7 million in non-comparable net sales. Retail segment comparable net sales increased 21.4% at Free People and 12.3% at Anthropologie and decreased 13.8% at Urban Outfitters. Retail segment comparable net sales increased in North America and decreased in Europe. The overall increase in Retail segment comparable net sales was driven by mid single-digit positive growth in both digital channel sales and retail store sales. The digital channel net sales increase was driven by increases in sessions and average order value, while conversion rate and units per transaction decreased. Comparable store net sales increased as a result of higher store traffic, average unit retail price and an increase in transactions, which were partially offset by decreases in conversion rate and units per transaction. The increase in non-comparable net sales during fiscal 2024 was due to the impact of the 24 net new Company-owned stores and restaurants opened since the prior comparable period and the positive impact of foreign currency translation.

29

The increase in Subscription segment net sales was primarily driven by an 81.6% increase in average active subscribers in the current year versus the prior year period. The decrease in Wholesale segment net sales in fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023 was driven by an $11.1 million, or 4.8%, decrease in Free People wholesale sales primarily due to decreases in sales to department stores and closeout account partners.

Gross profit percentage for fiscal 2024 increased to 33.3% of net sales, from 29.8% of net sales in fiscal 2023. Gross profit increased to $1.72 billion for fiscal 2024 from $1.43 billion in fiscal 2023. The increase in gross profit rate was primarily due to higher initial merchandise markups and lower merchandise markdowns in the Retail segment at Anthropologie, Free People and Urban Outfitters. The improvement in initial merchandise markups was primarily driven by lower inbound transportation costs. The increase in gross profit dollars was due to the improved gross profit rate and higher net sales. Additionally, the Company recorded $11.9 million of store impairment and lease abandonment charges during fiscal 2024, and $6.4 million of store impairment charges during fiscal 2023.

Total inventory at January 31, 2024, decreased by $37.3 million, or 6.3%, to $550.2 million from $587.5 million at January 31, 2023. Total Retail segment inventory decreased by 4.6%, with Retail segment comparable inventory decreasing by 1.9%. Wholesale segment inventory decreased by 22.0% due to improved inventory control.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $138.6 million, or 11.5%, compared to the prior year’s comparable period, and expressed as a percentage of net sales, deleveraged 95 basis points. The deleverage in selling, general and administrative expenses as a rate to sales was primarily related to increased marketing and creative expenses to support increased sales and customer growth and higher incentive-based compensation costs due to improved Company performance. The dollar growth in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily related to increased marketing and creative expenses to support increased sales and customer growth, increased store payroll expenses to support retail store comparable net sales growth and the net growth in retail store count and higher incentive-based compensation costs due to improved Company performance. Additionally, during fiscal 2024, the Company recorded an asset impairment charge of $6.4 million related to the write-off of "Property and equipment, net" of the Nuuly Thrift marketplace which the Company wound down in fiscal 2025.

Income from operations for fiscal 2024 was 7.2% of net sales, or $369.8 million, compared to 4.7% of net sales, or $226.6 million, for fiscal 2023. The increase in operating income dollars was primarily driven by the increase in gross profit. The increase in operating income rate was primarily due to the higher gross profit rate.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2024 was 24.6% compared to 27.8% in fiscal 2023. See Note 10, “Income Taxes,” in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate.

The increase in working capital at January 31, 2025, as compared to January 31, 2024, and January 31, 2023, was primarily due to the increases in cash, cash equivalents and current marketable securities and inventory, partially offset by the timing of disbursements.

During the last three years, we have satisfied our cash requirements primarily through our cash flow from operating activities, and additionally, during fiscal 2023, through the sales and maturities of marketable securities. Our primary uses of cash have been to fund business operations, purchase inventory and rental product, expand and improve our fulfillment centers, open new stores and repurchase our common shares.

30

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

For all periods, our major source of cash from operations was merchandise sales and our primary outflow of cash from operations was for the payment of operational costs. The decrease in cash flows from operations for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024 was primarily due to higher inventory purchases in fiscal 2025 and the timing of disbursements, partially offset by higher net income in fiscal 2025. The increase in cash flows from operations for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 was primarily due to higher net income, the timing of disbursements and lower inventory purchases in fiscal 2024.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

For all periods, cash used in investing activities was primarily related to the purchases of marketable securities and property and equipment, partially offset by the sales and maturities of marketable securities. Cash paid for property and equipment for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023 was $182.6 million, $199.6 million and $199.5 million, respectively, which was primarily used to expand our fulfillment center network and store base in all fiscal years.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2025 was primarily related to $52.3 million of repurchases of our common shares under our share repurchase program. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2024 was primarily related to repurchases of our common shares from employees to meet payroll tax withholding requirements on vested share-based awards. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2023 was primarily related to $112.0 million of repurchases of our common shares under our share repurchase program.

Credit Facilities

See Note 8, "Debt," in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for certain financial information regarding the Company's debt.

Capital and Operating Expenditures

During fiscal 2026, we plan to open approximately 58 new Company-owned retail locations, expand or relocate certain existing retail locations, expand our home office to support our growing business, invest in new products, markets and brands, purchase inventory and rental product for our operating segments at levels appropriate to maintain our planned sales volumes, upgrade our systems, improve and expand our digital capabilities and invest in omni-channel marketing when appropriate. We may also repurchase our common shares. We believe that our new brand initiatives, new store openings, merchandise expansion programs, international growth opportunities and our marketing, social media, website and mobile initiatives are significant contributors to our sales growth and plan to continue our investment in these initiatives for all brands. We anticipate our capital expenditures during fiscal 2026 to be approximately $240 million for retail store expansion and support, technology and logistics investments and home office expansion to support our growing business. All fiscal 2026 capital expenditures are expected to be financed by cash flow from operating activities and existing cash and cash equivalents. We believe that our new store investments generally have the potential to generate positive cash flow within a year. We may also enter into one or more acquisitions or transactions related to the expansion of our brand offerings, including additional franchise and joint venture agreements. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, availability under our current credit facilities and future cash flows provided by operations will be sufficient to fund these initiatives.

Share Repurchases

32

Seasonality

Our business experiences seasonal fluctuations in net sales and net income, with a more significant portion of net sales typically realized in the second half of each year predominantly due to the year-end holiday period. Historically, and consistent with the retail industry, the seasonality also impacts our working capital requirements, particularly with regard to inventory.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitat
ive Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to the following types of market risks—fluctuations in the purchase price of merchandise, as well as other goods and services, the value of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar and changes in interest rates. Due to our inventory turnover rate and our historical ability to pass through the impact of any generalized changes in our cost of goods to our customers through pricing adjustments, commodity and other product risks are not expected to be material. We purchase the majority of our merchandise in U.S. dollars, including a majority of the goods for our stores located in Canada and a portion of the goods for our stores located in Europe.

Our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currencies is due to our financial statements being presented in U.S. dollars and our international subsidiaries transacting in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates in effect during or at the end of the reporting period may affect the value of the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. As we expand our international operations, the potential impact of currency fluctuations increases.

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the Credit Facility. As of January 31, 2025, and 2024, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted primarily of cash on hand and in banks, money market accounts, corporate, municipal and pre-refunded municipal bonds rated "BBB" or better, commercial paper and federally insured or guaranteed investment vehicles such as certificates of deposit, United States treasury securities and federal government agencies and mutual funds. Due to the short average maturity and conservative nature of our investment portfolio, we believe a 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements. As the interest rates on a material portion of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are variable, a change in interest rates earned on the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities would impact interest income along with cash flows, but would not impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments.

We are exposed to market risks relating to changes in interest rates on outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility because these borrowings bear interest at variable rates. A 100 basis point change in our applicable interest rate would not have a material impact to interest expense for the year ended January 31, 2025.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework
 issued in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2025.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Urban Outfitters, Inc.

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Urban Outfitters, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of January 31, 2025, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of January 31, 2025, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for the year ended January 31, 2025, and our report dated April 1, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPEND
ENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Urban Outfitters, Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Urban Outfitters, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of January 31, 2025 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2025, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 31, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2025, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025, based on criteria established in 
lnternal Control - lntegrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated April 1, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Retail Location Asset Impairment — Refer to Note 2 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

The Company evaluates retail location assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances exist that may indicate that the carrying amounts of retail location assets may not be recoverable. Events that result in an impairment review include plans to close a retail location, a significant decrease in the operating results of the retail location or significant adverse changes in the business climate. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, the Company evaluates its retail location assets for impairment by comparing the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the location to the location assets’ carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the location assets exceed the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an analysis is performed to estimate the fair value of the assets. An impairment charge is recorded if the fair value of the retail location assets is less than the carrying amount. Retail location asset impairment charges of $0.815 million are included in the Company's Store Impairment and Lease Abandonment Charges for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025.

The Company makes significant assumptions to evaluate retail location assets for possible indications of impairment. When an

F-

indication of impairment is identified, management makes significant assumptions to estimate cash flows from forecasts of sales and gross profit for retail locations and, when the carrying amount of the location assets exceed those cash flows, to determine the fair value of the Company’s lease right-of-use assets.

Given the Company’s evaluation of retail location asset impairment requires management to make significant assumptions, performing audit procedures to evaluate whether management appropriately identified events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amounts of retail location assets may not be recoverable, and, when applicable, developed reasonable forecasts of sales and gross profit and fair value estimates for lease right-of-use assets, including the methodology applied and the measurement inputs of market rent, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the assistance of our fair value specialists.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures to evaluate whether management appropriately identified events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amounts of retail location assets may not be recoverable, and, when applicable, developed reasonable forecasts of sales and gross profit and determined fair value estimates for lease right-of-use assets, included the following, among others:

•
We tested the effectiveness of the controls over management’s identification of events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amounts of retail location assets may not be recoverable, the review of forecasts of sales and gross profit and the review of the methodology and the measurement inputs of market rent, underlying the fair value estimates for lease right-of-use assets.

•
We evaluated management’s impairment analysis by:

-
Testing retail location assets for possible indications of impairment, including searching for locations with a current period loss and a history of losses.

-
Evaluating whether the events or changes in circumstances that may have existed were identified by management, consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.

•
We evaluated management’s ability to accurately estimate cash flow from forecasts of sales and gross profit for retail locations and the reasonableness of the forecasts by comparing them to: 

-
Historical sales and gross profit.

-
Internal communications to management and the board of directors. 

-
External communications made by management to analysts and investors.

-
External information regarding retail industry growth and trends.

•
With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the valuation methodology applied and fair value determined for the lease right-of-use assets by: 

-
Testing the methodology applied and measurement inputs of market rent, underlying the determination of the fair value and the mathematical accuracy of the calculation. 

-
Developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the fair value determined by management.

URBAN OUTFITTERS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(in thousands, except share and per share data)

1. Nature of 
Business
Urban Outfitters, Inc. (the “Company” or “Urban Outfitters”), which was founded in 1970, was incorporated in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1976. The principal business activities of the Company are the operation of retail, subscription and wholesale businesses selling and renting to customers through various channels including retail locations, websites, catalogs and mobile applications. As of January 31, 2025 and 2024, the Company operated 
733
 and 
706
 stores, respectively. Stores located in North America totaled 
637
 as of January 31, 2025 and 
609
 as of January 31, 2024. Operations in Europe included 
96
 stores as of January 31, 2025 and 
97
 stores as of January 31, 2024. The Company's Subscription segment, formerly known as the Nuuly segment, consists of the Nuuly brand, which is primarily a monthly women's apparel subscription rental service. The Company’s Wholesale segment sold and distributed apparel to department and specialty stores worldwide, digital businesses and to the Company’s Retail segment.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Fiscal Year-End
The Company operates on a fiscal year ending January 31 of each year. All references to fiscal years of the Company refer to the fiscal years ended on January 31 in those years. For example, the Company’s fiscal 2025 ended on January 31, 2025.
Principles of Consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and all of its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash and short-term highly liquid investments with maturities of less than three months at the time of purchase. These short-term highly liquid investments are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash and so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. As of January 31, 2025 and 2024, cash and cash equivalents included cash on hand, cash in banks, money market accounts and marketable securities with maturities of less than three months at the time of purchase.
Marketable Securities
All of the Company’s marketable securities as of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024 are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value. Interest on these securities, as well as the amortization of discounts and premiums, is included in “Interest income” in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company records unrealized gains and losses on these securities (other than mutual funds held in the rabbi trust for the Urban Outfitters, Inc. Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan (See Note 4, “Marketable Securities”)) as a component of “Other comprehensive (loss) income” in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” within “Shareholders’ equity” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets until realized, except when the Company determines there is a credit loss. Credit losses are considered to be realized losses. Mutual funds held in the rabbi trust have been accounted for under the fair value option, which results in all unrealized gains and losses being recorded in “Interest income” in the Consolidated Statements of Income. When available-for-sale securities are sold, the cost of the securities is specifically identified and is used to determine the realized gain or loss. Securities classified as current assets have maturity dates of less than or equal to one year from the balance sheet date. Securities classified as non-current assets have maturity dates greater than one year from the balance sheet date.

Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable primarily consists of amounts due from the Company’s wholesale customers as well as credit card receivables outstanding with third-party credit card vendors.

Inventory
Inventory, which consists primarily of general consumer merchandise held for sale, is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined on the first-in, first-out method and includes the cost of merchandise and import-related costs, including freight, import duties and taxes and agent commissions. A periodic review of inventory is performed in order to determine if inventory is properly stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Factors the Company considers in its review, such as future expected consumer demand and fashion trends, current aging, current and anticipated retail markdowns or wholesale discounts and class or type of inventory, are analyzed to determine estimated net realizable value. Criteria that the Company considers in its review of aging trends include average selling cycle and seasonality of merchandise, the historical rate at which merchandise has sold below cost during the prior 12 months and the value and nature of merchandise currently held in inventory and priced below original cost. A provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventory to its estimated net realizable value, if appropriate. The majority of inventory at January 31, 2025 and 2024 consisted of finished goods. Raw materials and work-in-process were not material to the overall inventory value.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost and primarily consist of store leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, buildings and other operating equipment. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the 
lesser of the lease term or useful life for leasehold improvements
, 
five years
 for furniture and fixtures, 
39
 years for buildings and 
three
 to 
15 years
 for other operating equipment. Major renovations or improvements that extend the service lives of our assets are capitalized over the lesser of the extension period, life of the improvement, or the remaining term of the lease.
Rental Product
The cost of subscription rental product is amortized to cost of sales over the subscription period based on the cost of each unit rented, which is estimated based on the number of times the unit is expected to be rented and the cost of the rental product. Lost, damaged and retired rental product is also charged to cost of sales. Purchases of rental product were $
175,697
, $
150,668
, and $
103,260
 for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Impairment of Long-lived Assets
The Company reviews the carrying values of its definite-lived, long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Events that result in an impairment review include plans to close a retail location, distribution or fulfillment center, a significant decrease in the operating results of a long-lived asset or significant adverse changes in the business climate. The Company’s retail locations are reviewed for impairment at the retail location level, which is the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified. Newly opened retail locations may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results. Factors such as store type (e.g., mall versus free-standing), location (e.g., urban area versus college campus or suburb), current marketplace awareness of our brands, local customer demographic data and current fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required for a retail location to achieve positive financial results. When events indicate that an asset may be impaired and the estimated undiscounted cash flows (based on forecasts of sales and gross profit) are less than the carrying amount of the asset, the impaired asset is adjusted to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recorded. The estimated fair value of the asset or asset group is based on future cash flows of the asset or asset group. For lease right-of-use assets, the Company determines the estimated fair value of the assets by comparing the discounted contractual rent payments to estimated market rent using an acceptable valuation methodology. During fiscal 2025, the Company recorded impairment charges for 
one
 retail location, totaling $
815
, with a carrying value after impairment of $
1,500
 related to the right-of-use assets. During fiscal 2024, the Company recorded impairment charges for 
15
 locations, totaling $
3,644
, with a carrying value after impairment of $
41,046
 related 
to the right-of-use assets. During

F-

URBAN OUTFITTERS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
(in thousands, except share and per share data)

fiscal 
2023, the Company recorded impairment charges for 
19
 locations, totaling $
6,417
, with a carrying value after impairment of $
48,970
 related to the right-of-use assets. Additionally, during fiscal 2024 the Company recorded an asset impairment charge of $
6,404
 related to the write-off of "Property and Equipment, net" of the Nuuly Thrift marketplace.
Leases
The Company has operating leases for stores, distribution and fulfillment centers, corporate offices and equipment that are recognized as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. The Company subleases certain properties to third parties. The Company has elected not to record a lease liability and right-of-use asset for leases with original terms of 12 months or less. The Company has elected the practical expedient to not separate non-lease components from lease components as it pertains to real estate leases.
Store leases generally have initial lease terms that range from 
5
 to 
15
 years
, some of which contain options to extend the lease for 
one or two 5-year periods
. Payments related to a renewal period are included in the lease liability and right-of-use asset only when the Company is reasonably certain that it will exercise the option to renew the lease for an extended period of time. Certain leases may contain variable lease payments such as rent based on a percentage of net sales. Variable lease payments may be subject to a breakpoint threshold of fixed rent. Variable lease payments, other than those that depend on an index or a rate, are not included in the measurement of the lease liability. The lease liability is calculated at the present value of certain future payments, discounted using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate, which approximates the rate of interest the Company would pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a fully collateralized basis over a similar term. Significant judgment is used in determining the incremental borrowing rate related to estimates for credit rating, credit spread and the impact of collateral. The Company developed incremental borrowing rates at a lease portfolio level. The right-of-use asset is initially equal to the value of the lease liability less any amounts received from the landlord as incentives or tenant improvement allowances.
Revenue Recognition
Merchandise: 
Merchandise is sold through retail stores, catalogs and the digital sales channel, as well as to wholesale customers, franchise partners and subscription customers. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods is transferred to the customer. The Company has elected to treat shipping and handling as fulfillment activities and not a separate performance obligation. Accordingly, the Company will recognize merchandise revenue for the Retail segment for its single performance obligation at the point of sale, when furniture is delivered or at the time of shipment for non-furniture merchandise, which is when transfer of control to the customer occurs. A subscription customer may purchase merchandise through the Nuuly website or mobile application, which will ship along with their next monthly subscription rental order, and we recognize such merchandise revenue at the time of shipment. A subscription customer may also purchase merchandise in their possession that was delivered as part of the customer's monthly subscription rental order, and we recognize such merchandise revenue when the customer purchases the merchandise through the website or mobile application. Revenue does not include taxes assessed by governmental authorities, including value-added and other sales-related taxes, that are imposed on and concurrent with revenue-producing activities. Revenue is recognized net of estimated customer returns. Uncollectible accounts receivable in the Retail and Subscription segments primarily results from unauthorized credit card transactions. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for its Wholesale segment accounts receivable, which management reviews on a regular basis and believes is sufficient to cover potential credit losses and billing adjustments. Payment terms in the Wholesale segment vary by customer.
Subscription Fees:
 Revenue for the Subscription segment is primarily generated through monthly subscription fees. The monthly subscription rental fee is recognized over the monthly period over which the customer's monthly subscription fee pertains. The subscription automatically renews on a monthly basis until cancelled or paused by the customer at which point the customer will not be billed for future months until the subscription is no longer paused.

Gift Cards: 
The Company accounts for a gift card transaction by recording a liability at the time the gift card is issued to the customer in exchange for consideration from the customer. At the time of issuance, the Company has an open performance obligation for the future delivery of promised goods or services. The liability remains outstanding until the card is redeemed by the customer, at which time the Company recognizes revenue. Over time, a portion of the outstanding gift cards will not be redeemed by the customer which we refer to as “breakage.” Revenue is recognized from breakage over time in proportion to gift card redemptions. Judgment is used in determining the amount of breakage revenue to be recognized and is based on historical gift card redemption patterns. Gift card breakage revenue is included in net sales and is not material. The Company’s gift cards do not expire.

Sales Return Reserve
The Company records a sales return reserve for estimated product returns where the sale has occurred during the period reported, but the return is likely to occur subsequent to the period reported. The reserve for estimated product returns is based on the Company’s most recent historical return trends. If the actual return rate is materially different than the Company’s estimate, sales returns would be adjusted in the future. The costs of returns are recorded as a current asset rather than net with the sales return reserve. As of January 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023, the sales return reserve was $
90,429
, $
80,512
 and $
70,147
, respectively.

Cost of Sales
Cost of sales includes the following: the cost of merchandise; obsolescence and shrink provisions; store and fulfillment center occupancy costs, including rent, depreciation, common area maintenance costs and real estate taxes; delivery expense; inbound and outbound freight; customs related taxes and duties; inventory acquisition and purchasing costs; design costs; warehousing and handling costs; the amortization of rental product; the net unamortized cost of rental product at time of purchase by a customer; and other inventory and rental product acquisition related costs.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses includes expenses such as direct selling and selling supervisory expenses; marketing and web creative expenses; various corporate expenses such as information technology, finance, loss prevention, talent acquisition, home office and executive management expenses; share-based compensation expense; and other associated general expenses.
Shipping and Handling Revenues and Costs
The Company includes shipping and handling revenues in net sales and shipping and handling costs in cost of sales. The Company’s shipping and handling revenues consist of amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling merchandise. Shipping and handling costs include shipping supplies, related labor costs and third-party shipping costs.
Advertising
The Company expenses the costs of advertising when the advertising occurs, except for certain digital channel advertising, which is capitalized and expensed when the catalog is mailed or the content is published on the Company’s websites and mobile applications. Advertising costs primarily relate to Retail segment marketing expenses which are comprised of web marketing, catalog printing, paper, postage and other costs related to production of photographic images used in the Company’s catalogs, websites, mobile applications and social media campaigns. If there is no expected future benefit, the cost of advertising is expensed when incurred. Advertising costs reported as prepaid expenses were $
2,254
 and $
1,384
 as of January 31, 2025, and 2024, respectively, and are included in “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Advertising expenses were $
370,160
, $
322,252
 and $
279,174
 for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In addition, the Company incurred web creative expenses of $
81,820
, $
79,684
 and $
65,474
 for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Advertising expenses and web creative expenses are both included in “Selling, general and administrative expenses” in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Store Opening Costs
The Company expenses all store opening and organization costs as incurred, including travel, training, recruiting, salaries and other operating costs, and all such costs are included in “Selling, general and administrative expenses” in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Website Development Costs
The Company capitalizes applicable costs incurred during the application and infrastructure development stage and expenses costs incurred during the planning and operating stage. During fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, capitalized costs related to internally generated internal-use software were not material.
Income Taxes
The 
Company utilizes a balance sheet approach to provide for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of net operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Investment tax credits or grants are accounted for in the period earned. The Company files a consolidated United States federal income tax return (see Note 10, “Income Taxes,” for a further discussion of income

F-
12

URBAN OUTFITTERS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
(in thousands, except share and per share data)

taxes). 
The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

Net Income Per Common Share
Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares and common share equivalents outstanding. Common share equivalents include the effect of stock options, restricted stock units (“RSU’s”) and performance stock units (“PSU’s”).
Comprehensive Income and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss
Comprehensive income is comprised of two subsets—net income and other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive loss relate to foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities. The foreign currency translation adjustments are not adjusted for income taxes because these adjustments relate to non-U.S. subsidiaries for which foreign earnings have been designated as permanently reinvested. Accumulated other comprehensive loss consisted of foreign currency translation losses of $
46,474
 and $
38,376
 as of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024, respectively, and unrealized losses, net of tax, on marketable securities of $
166
 and $
771
 as of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024, respectively. The tax effect of the unrealized gains on marketable securities recorded in comprehensive income was $
165
, $
49
 and $
1,054
 during fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Gross realized gains and losses are included in “Interest income” in the Consolidated Statements of Income and were not material to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for all three years presented.
Foreign Currency
The financial statements of the Company’s foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at current exchange rates as of the balance sheet date, equity accounts at historical exchange rates, while income statement accounts are translated at the average rates in effect during the year. Translation adjustments are not included in determining net income, but are included in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” within “Shareholders’ equity.” Remeasurement gains and losses included in operating results for fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023 were not material.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and accounts receivable. The Company manages the credit risk associated with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities by investing in high-quality securities held with reputable trustees and, by policy, limiting the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer or issue, as well as providing limitations on investment duration. The Company’s investment policy requires that its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are invested in corporate, municipal and pre-refunded municipal bonds rated “BBB” or better, commercial paper and federally insured or guaranteed investment vehicles such as certificates of deposit, United States treasury securities and federal government agencies. Receivables from third-party credit cards are processed by financial institutions, which are monitored for financial stability. The Company regularly evaluates the financial condition of its Wholesale segment customers. The Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts reflects current market conditions and management’s assessment regarding the collectability of its accounts receivable. The Company maintains cash accounts that, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses from maintaining cash accounts in excess of such limits. Management believes that it is not exposed to any significant risks related to its cash accounts.
Commitments and Contingencies
From time to time, the Company is named as a defendant in legal actions arising from normal business activities. The Company records a reserve for estimated losses when information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Recently Adopted
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued an accounting standards update that introduces additional segment disclosure requirements. The update requires entities to quantitatively disclose significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker for each reportable segment, as well as an amount for other segment items for

F-
13

URBAN OUTFITTERS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
(in thousands, except share and per share data)

each reportable segment and a description of their composition. Entities are required to disclose how reported measures of segment profit or loss are used in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The Company adopted this update in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, on a retrospective basis. The adoption of this update resulted in additional disclosures in the notes to its consolidated financial statements.
Recently Issued
In November 2024, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which requires disaggregated disclosure of certain costs and expenses including purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, amortization and other costs within relevant income statement captions. The update will be effective for the Company in its annual consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2028, and interim periods thereafter. The Company is currently assessing this update and the additional disclosures that will be required within the notes to its consolidated financial statements.
In December 2023, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which includes amendments that further enhance income tax disclosures. The update requires disaggregated information about an entity's effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid by jurisdiction, among other changes. The update will be effective for the Company in its annual consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2026, and can be applied prospectively or retrospectively. The Company is currently assessing this update and the additional disclosures that will be required within the notes to its consolidated financial statements.

3. Revenue from Contracts with Customers
Contract receivables occur when the Company satisfies all of its performance obligations under a contract and recognizes revenue prior to billing or receiving consideration from a customer for which it has an unconditional right to payment. Contract receivables arise from credit card and other electronic payment transactions and sales to the Company’s Wholesale segment customers and franchisees. For the year ended January 31, 2025, the opening and closing balance of contract receivables, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $
67,008
 and $
74,014
, respectively. For the year ended January 31, 2024, the opening and closing balance of contract receivables, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $
70,339
 and $
67,008
, respectively. Contract receivables are included in “Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Contract liabilities represent unearned revenue and result from the Company receiving consideration in a contract with a customer for which it has not satisfied all of its performance obligations. The Company’s contract liabilities result from the issuance of gift cards, customer deposits, Nuuly deferred subscription fee revenue and customer loyalty programs. Gift cards are expected to be redeemed within 
two years
 of issuance, with the majority of redemptions occurring in the first year. For the year ended January 31, 2025, the opening and closing balance of contract liabilities was $
91,408
 and $
101,866
, respectively. For the year ended January 31, 2024, the opening and closing balance of contract liabilities was $
82,867
 and $
91,408
, respectively. Contract liabilities are included in “Accrued expenses and other current liabilities” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the year ended January 31, 2025, the Company recognized $
48,584
 of revenue that was included in the contract liability balance at the beginning of the period. During the year ended January 31, 2024, the Company recognized $
37,751
 of revenue that was included in the contract liability balance at the beginning of the period.
See Note 17, “Segment Reporting,” for additional information including net sales recorded by reportable segment and net sales from contracts with customers by merchandise category.

5. Fair Value
The Company utilizes a hierarchy that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used for the various valuation techniques (market approach, income approach and cost approach that relate to its financial assets and financial liabilities). The levels of the hierarchy are described as follows:
•
Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
•
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; these include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.
•
Level 3: Unobservable inputs that reflect the Company’s own assumptions.

F-
16

URBAN OUTFITTERS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
(in thousands, except share and per share data)

Management’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of financial assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy. 
The Company’s financial assets that are accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis are presented in the tables below:

Financial assets
Level 1 assets consist of financial instruments whose value has been based on inputs that use, as their basis, readily observable market data that are actively quoted and are validated through external sources, including third-party pricing services and brokers.
Level 2 assets consist of financial instruments whose value has been based on quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets as well as quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.
Level 3 assets consist of financial instruments where there has been no active market. The Company held no Level 3 financial instruments as of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024.
The fair value of cash and cash equivalents (Level 1) approximates carrying value since cash and cash equivalents consist of short-term highly liquid investments with maturities of less than three months at the time of purchase. As of January 31, 2025 and 2024, cash and cash equivalents included cash on hand, cash in banks, money market accounts and marketable securities with maturities of less than three months at the time of purchase.
Non-financial assets
The Company’s non-financial assets, primarily consisting of property and equipment and lease-related right-of-use assets, are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
The 
fair value of property and equipment was determined using a discounted cash-flow model that utilized Level 3 inputs. The Company’s retail locations are reviewed for impairment at the retail location level, which is the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified. In calculating future cash flows, the Company makes estimates regarding future operating results based on its experience and knowledge of market factors in its retail locations. Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment in the same manner as property and equipment. For lease right-of-use assets, the Company determines the estimated fair value of the assets by comparing the discounted contractual rent payments to estimated market rent using an acceptable valuation methodology. During fiscal 2025, 2024

and 
2023, the Company determined that certain long-lived assets at the Company’s retail locations were unable to recover their carrying value. These assets were written down to their fair values resulting in impairment charges of $
815
, $
3,644
 and $
6,417
 in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Additionally, during fiscal 2024 the Company recorded an asset impairment charge of $

 related to the write-off of "Property and Equipment, net" of the Nuuly Thrift marketplace.

8. Debt
On February 10, 2023, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into the fourth amendment (the "Fourth Amendment") to the Company's amended and restated credit agreement (the "Amended Credit Agreement"), amending the Company's asset-based revolving credit facility with its lenders, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, joint lead arranger and co-book managers along with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the "Amended Credit Facility"). The Fourth Amendment permits the Company to purchase an equity membership interest in a federal low-income housing tax credit entity. See Note 10, "Income Taxes," for further discussion of the investment.
The Amended Credit Facility provides for loans and letters of credit up to $
350,000
, subject to a borrowing base that is comprised of the Company’s eligible accounts receivable and inventory and includes a swing-line sub-facility, a multicurrency sub-facility and the option to expand the facility by up to $
150,000
. Borrowings under the Amended Credit Facility may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The Amended Credit Facility matures in June 2027.
The Amended Credit Facility provides for interest on borrowings, at the Company’s option, at either (i) adjusted SOFR, CDOR, SONIA or EURIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 
1.125
% to 
1.375
%, or (ii) an adjusted ABR plus an applicable margin ranging from 
0.125
% to 
0.375
%, 
each such applicable margin depending on the level of availability under the Amended Credit Facility.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
(in thousands, except share and per share data)

Depending 
on the type of borrowing, interest on the Amended Credit Facility is payable monthly, quarterly or at the end of the applicable interest period. A commitment fee of 
0.20
% is payable quarterly on the unused portion of the Amended Credit Facility.
All obligations under the Amended Credit Facility are unconditionally guaranteed by the Company and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries. The obligations under the Amended Credit Facility are secured by a first-priority security interest in inventory, accounts receivable and certain other assets of the Company and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries. The obligations of URBN Canada Retail, Inc. are secured by a first-priority security interest in its inventory, accounts receivable and certain other assets. The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, negative and affirmative covenants and provisions relating to events of default.
As of January 31, 2025, the Company had $
0
 in borrowings under the Amended Credit Facility. As of January 31, 2025, the Company was in compliance with the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement and expects to remain in compliance with all terms, including covenants, of the Amended Credit Agreement. Outstanding stand-by letters of credit, which reduce the funds available under the Amended Credit Facility, were $
9,524
. Interest expense for the Amended Credit Facility was $
978
, $
971
, and $
998
 for the years ended January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively, which was included in “Interest expense,” in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

During fiscal 2024, the Company committed to cease operations for two store locations but the lease has not been terminated, resulting in the right-of-use assets to be abandoned. When a lease right-of-use asset has been abandoned, the estimated useful life of the asset is updated to reflect the cease use date, and the remaining carrying value of the asset is amortized ratably over the period between the commitment date and the cease use date. During fiscal 2024, the Company recorded lease abandonment charges for two retail locations, totaling $
8,231
, with a remaining carrying value of $
3,786
 related to the right-of-use asset for one store location which was expensed in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.

The variance in percentages for the components of the effective tax rate for fiscal 2025 as compared to fiscal 2024 and 2023 is primarily due to the tax benefit from the release of a portion of our income tax reserves in fiscal 2025 as a result of a lapse of the statute of limitations for federal tax purposes. The variance in percentages for the components of the effective tax rate for fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023 is primarily due to the ratio of foreign taxable losses to global taxable profits and the favorable impact of general business credits in fiscal 2024.

24,557
 and $
18,421
 were attributable to U.S. federal, $
18,256
 and $
19,637
 were attributed to state jurisdictions and $
5,654
 and $
8,118
 were attributed to foreign jurisdictions.
As of January 31, 2025, certain non-U.S. subsidiaries of the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes of approximately $
54,299
 that do not expire. Certain U.S. subsidiaries of the Company had state net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes of approximately $
20,355
 that expire from 
2030
 through 
2044
 and approximately $
10,211
 that do not expire. Certain U.S. subsidiaries of the Company had state credit carryforwards for tax purposes of approximately $
4,542
 that expire from 
2027
 through 
2030
. As of January 31, 2025, the Company had full and partial valuation allowances for certain foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards and a partial valuation allowance against state credit carryforwards where it was uncertain the carryforwards would be utilized. The Company had 
no
 valuation allowance for certain other foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards where management believes it is more-likely-than-not the tax benefit of these carryforwards will be realized.
As of January 31, 2025, approximately $
131,161
 of cash and cash equivalents were held by the Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries for which no deferred taxes have been provided. The Company has accumulated undistributed earnings generated by foreign subsidiaries of approximately $
197,842
. Since such earnings have previously been subject to the one-time deemed repatriation transition tax required by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or other U.S. tax requirements on undistributed foreign earnings, any additional taxes due with respect to such earnings or the excess of the amount for financial reporting over the tax basis of our foreign investments would generally be limited to foreign and state taxes. The Company continues to believe that foreign earnings are indefinitely reinvested excluding earnings that have previously been subject to the one-time deemed repatriation transition tax required by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. With respect to outside basis differences in all other non-U.S. subsidiaries, the Company expects that either (i) such basis differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future, or (ii) such basis differences will reverse in a tax-neutral manner.

 as of January 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The Company accrues interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income, which is consistent with the recognition of these items in prior reporting periods. During the years ended January 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized benefits of $
5,878
 and expense of $
1,629
 and $
1,145
, respectively, related to interest and penalties. The Company accrued $
337
 and $
6,214
 for the payment of interest and penalties as of January 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is under audit in certain state and foreign jurisdictions. Certain federal, foreign and state jurisdictions are subject to audit from fiscal 2010 to 2024. It is possible that a state or foreign examination may be resolved within 12 months. Due to the potential for resolution of federal and foreign audit and state examinations, and the expiration of various statutes of limitation, it is possible that the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next 12 months by a range of 
zero
 to $
155
.
Tax Credit Investment
On February 10, 2023, the Company committed $
100,000
 to purchase an equity membership interest in a federal low-income housing tax credit entity. An initial payment of $
20,000
 was paid at closing with the remaining balance payable in quarterly installments over a 
five-year
 period beginning in fiscal 2024. The present value of such payments was $
62,120
 and was recorded as an increase to the initial tax credit investment asset and liability. In exchange for the total payments of $
100,000
, the Company expects to realize a comparable amount of tax credits and other tax benefits that will reduce its future federal income tax payments. Although the investment vehicle is considered a variable interest entity, the Company is not the primary beneficiary, and therefore, the investment is not consolidated. The Company has elected to use the practical expedient method of amortization, which approximates the proportional amortization method, to amortize the investment to income tax expense in proportion to the tax credits received over an estimated 10-year tax credit period beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. During the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025 and 2024, interest expense related to the accretion of the liability was $
4,906
 and $
6,190
, respectively. Included in "Income tax expense" in the Consolidated Statements of Income was amortization of the investment of $
17,224
 and $
15,906
 for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Also included in "Income tax expense" in the Consolidated Statements of Income were income tax credits and other income tax benefits of $
24,110
 and $
22,575
 for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The carrying value of the investment is recorded in "Other assets" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The liabilities for the present value of the estimated future capital contributions are recorded in "Accrued expenses and other current liabilities" and "Other non-current liabilities" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Company may grant PSU’s that vest based on the achievement of various company performance targets and external market conditions. The fair value of the PSU’s awarded during fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023 equaled the stock price on the date of the grant. The Company makes certain estimates about the number of awards that will vest. Once the Company determines that it is probable that the performance targets will be met, compensation expense is recorded for these awards. If any of these performance targets are not met, the awards are forfeited. Each PSU is equal to one common share with varying maximum award value limitations. PSU’s typically vest over a two to four-year period.

14. Net Income Per Common Share
Basic net income per common share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net income per common share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method for the Company's stock options, performance stock units and restricted stock units. 
The following is a reconciliation of the weighted-average common shares outstanding used for the computation of basic and diluted net income per common share:

17. Segment Reporting
The Company offers lifestyle-oriented general merchandise and products and services through a portfolio of global consumer brands. The Company operates 
three
 reportable segments—“Retail,” “Subscription” and “Wholesale.”

The Company’s Retail segment includes Anthropologie (which includes the Anthropologie and Terrain brands), Free People (which includes the Free People and FP Movement brands), Urban Outfitters and Menus & Venues. As of January 31, 2025, there were 
255
 Urban Outfitters stores, 
239
 Anthropologie stores, 
230
 Free People stores (including 
63
 FP Movement stores), 
9
 Menus & Venues locations, 
7
 Urban Outfitters franchisee-owned stores and 
2
 Anthropologie franchisee-owned stores. Each of Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie and Free People, including their Company-owned and franchisee-owned store and digital channels, and Menus & Venues locations, are considered an operating segment. Net sales from the Retail segment accounted for approximately 
88.2
%, 
90.8
% and 
92.1
% of total consolidated net sales for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The Company has aggregated its brands into the Retail segment based upon their shared management, customer base and economic characteristics. Reporting in this format provides management with the financial information necessary to evaluate the success of the segments and the overall business. The Company’s Retail segment omni-channel strategy enhances its customers’ brand experience by providing a seamless approach to the customer shopping experience. All available Company-owned Retail segment shopping channels are closely integrated, including retail locations, websites, mobile applications, catalogs and customer contact centers. The Company’s investments in areas such as marketing campaigns and technology advancements are designed to generate demand for the Retail segment omni-channel and not the separate store or digital channels. The Company manages and analyzes its performance based on a single Retail segment omni-channel rather than separate channels and believes that the Retail segment omni-channel results present the most meaningful and appropriate measure of our performance.
The Company's Subscription segment, formerly known as the Nuuly segment, includes the Nuuly brand, which is primarily a monthly women’s apparel subscription rental service. For a monthly fee, Nuuly subscribers can rent product from a wide selection of the Company’s own brands, third-party brands and one-of-a-kind vintage pieces via a custom-built, digital platform. Subscribers select their products each month, wear them as often as they like and then swap into new products the following month. Subscribers are also able to purchase rental product. Net sales from the Subscription segment accounted for approximately 
6.8
%, 
4.6
%, and 
2.7
% of total consolidated net sales for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The Company's Wholesale segment includes the Free People, FP Movement and Urban Outfitters brands that sell through department and specialty stores worldwide, third-party digital businesses and the Company's Retail segment. The Wholesale segment primarily designs, develops and markets young women’s contemporary casual apparel, intimates, FP Movement activewear and shoes under the Free People and FP Movement brands and the BDG and “iets frans” apparel collections under the Urban Outfitters brand. Net sales from the Wholesale segment accounted for approximately 
5.0
%, 
4.6
% and 
5.2
% of total consolidated net sales for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The Company's chief operating decision maker is the chief executive officer. The chief operating decision maker evaluates the performance of each segment based on the regularly reviewed net sales, gross profit and income from operations (excluding intercompany charges) of the segment. The chief operating decision maker uses net sales, gross profit and income from operations when evaluating each segment during the budget and forecasting processes. The chief operating decision maker considers actual-to-budget variances for both profit measures when assessing segment performance and making decisions about the allocation of operating and capital resources to each segment. General corporate expenses include expenses incurred and directed by the corporate office that are not allocated to segments. The principal identifiable assets for the Retail and Wholesale segments are inventory and property and equipment. The principal identifiable assets for the Subscription segment are rental product and property and equipment.
Other assets are comprised primarily of general corporate assets, which principally consist of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, deferred taxes and prepaid expenses, and are typically not allocated to the Company’s segments. The Company accounts for intersegment sales and transfers as if the sales and transfers were made to third parties making similar volume purchases.
