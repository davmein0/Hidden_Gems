Overview

We are a commercial-stage, patient-centric biopharmaceutical company focused on in-licensing, developing, and commercializing novel high-quality medicines for patients living with rare and difficult to treat diseases. We currently market three drug products, FIRDAPSE® (amifampridine), FYCOMPA® (perampanel), and AGAMREE® (vamorolone). We are also currently seeking to further expand our drug portfolio, with a focus on acquiring the rights to late-stage products to treat orphan, rare diseases across therapeutic areas. With an unwavering patient focus embedded in everything we do, we are committed to providing innovative, best-in-class medications with the hope of making a meaningful impact on those affected by these conditions.

FIRDAPSE®

On November 28, 2018, we received approval from the FDA for our new drug application, (NDA) for FIRDAPSE® Tablets 10 mg for the treatment of adult patients (ages 17 and above) with LEMS, and in January 2019, we launched FIRDAPSE® in the U.S. Further, on September 29, 2022, the FDA approved our supplemental NDA (sNDA) to expand the indicated age range for FIRDAPSE® Tablets 10 mg for the treatment of LEMS to include pediatric patients six years of age and older. Finally, on May 30, 2024, the FDA approved our sNDA increasing the indicated maximum daily dosage of FIRDAPSE® tablets for the treatment of patients with LEMS from 80 mg to 100 mg. We believe that this recent sNDA approval offers healthcare providers and patients greater flexibility in treatment regimens for the management of LEMS.

We sell FIRDAPSE® in the U.S. through a field-based force experienced in neurologic, central nervous system or rare disease products consisting at this time of approximately 41 field personnel, including sales (Regional Account Managers), thought leader liaisons and patient assistance and insurance navigation support (Patient Access Liaisons). These field personnel have also supported AGAMREE® since its commercial launch in March 2024. We also have a field-based force of 10 medical science liaisons who are helping educate the medical community about scientific literature concerning LEMS and FIRDAPSE®. Additionally, we use non-personal promotion to reach the 20,000 neurologists who are potential LEMS treaters and the 16,000 oncologists who might be treating a LEMS patient who also has small cell lung cancer. Further, we continue to make available at no-cost a LEMS voltage gated calcium channel antibody diagnostic testing program for use by physicians who suspect that one of their patients may have LEMS and wish to reach a definitive diagnosis.

When we launched AGAMREE®, in March 2024, we utilized the FIRDAPSE® commercial and medical field-based forces to market AGAMREE® as well. In early 2025, we made a strategic decision to split each of these field-based forces into two units, one for each function expressly focused on supporting FIRDAPSE® and one for each function expressly focused on supporting AGAMREE®. This change is being made in an effort to allow us to better focus our sales teams on the market for each product. We expect to complete this division of our field-based forces into two units early in the second quarter of 2025.

Finally, we are continuing to expand our digital and social media activities to introduce our products and services to potential patients and their healthcare providers. We also work with several rare disease advocacy organizations (including the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America, the National Organization for Rare Disorders, and the LEMS Family Association) to help increase awareness and level of support for patients living with LEMS and to provide education for the physicians who treat these rare diseases and the patients they treat.

We are supporting the distribution of FIRDAPSE® through Catalyst Pathways®, our personalized treatment support program for patients who enroll in it. Catalyst Pathways® is a single source for personalized treatment support, education and guidance through the challenging dosing and titration regimen required to reach an effective therapeutic dose. The program also includes distributing the drug through a very small group of exclusive specialty pharmacies (primarily AnovoRx), which is consistent with the way that most drug products for ultra-orphan diseases are distributed and dispensed to patients. We believe that by

3

Table of Contents

using specialty pharmacies in this way, the difficult task of navigating the health care system is far better for the patient needing treatment for their rare disease and the health care community in general.

In order to help patients with LEMS afford their medication, we, like other pharmaceutical companies which market drug products for ultra-orphan conditions, have developed an array of financial assistance programs to reduce out-of-pocket costs that makes FIRDAPSE® accessible and affordable. A co-pay assistance program has been designed to reduce commercial patients’ out of pocket costs to $0 whenever possible. Our FIRDAPSE® co-pay assistance program is not available to patients enrolled in state or federal healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Department of Defense (DoD), or TRICARE. However, we are donating, and committing to continue to donate, money to qualified, independent charitable foundations dedicated to providing assistance to any U.S. LEMS patients in financial need, who meet those independent organizations' guidelines. In addition, we have a safety net program in place for patients who are uninsured and underinsured. Subject to compliance with regulatory requirements, our goal is that no LEMS patient is ever denied access to their medication for financial reasons.

FIRDAPSE® is currently marketed for the treatment of LEMS in Canada through our exclusive sublicensee, KYE. We supply product to KYE at agreed upon prices and we are also eligible to earn sales milestones and sales royalties based on net revenues from sales of the product in Canada.

In December 2023, DyDo Pharma, Inc. (DyDo), our sub-licensee for FIRDAPSE® in Japan, filed a NDA with the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) in Japan seeking approval to commercialize FIRDAPSE® for the treatment of LEMS in Japan. Upon acceptance of the Japan NDA by the PMDA in December 2023, our license for FIRDAPSE® automatically expanded to include other key markets in Asia and Latin America, and we are currently seeking opportunities to expand FIRDAPSE®’s global footprint through strategic partnerships (with the current focus on the Asia Pacific and Latin American regions). Further, in September 2024, DyDo advised us that the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) had approved DyDo's Japan NDA to commercialize FIRDAPSE® for the treatment of patients with LEMS in Japan. Finally, DyDo began commercialization of FIRDAPSE® in Japan on January 21, 2025. We will generate revenue through additional milestone payments and a transfer price on the product supplied by us to DyDo, in lieu of royalties.

We control six U.S. patents for FIRDAPSE® that are listed in the FDA's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (Orange Book), the earliest of which expires in 2032 and the latest of which expires in 2037. We also have orphan drug exclusivity (ODE) for the product that will not expire until November 2025, and no Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) for the product can be finally approved by the FDA until the ODE exclusivity period has expired. Nevertheless, generic drug manufacturers were permitted to submit applications for the product challenging our patents starting in 2023.

In that regard, in January 2023, we received Paragraph IV Certification Notice Letters from three generic drug manufacturers (Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. and Teva Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (collectively Teva), Hetero USA, Inc. (Hetero), and Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Lupin)) advising that they had each submitted an ANDA to the FDA seeking authorization from the FDA to manufacture, use or sell a generic version of FIRDAPSE® in the U.S. The notice letters each alleged that the six patents protecting FIRDAPSE® that are listed in the Orange Book in connection with FIRDAPSE® are not valid, not enforceable, and/or will not be infringed by the commercial manufacture, use or sale of the proposed product described in these ANDA submissions. Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), as amended by the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, we had 45 days from receipt of the notice letters to determine if there were grounds to bring a lawsuit and, if so, to commence patent infringement lawsuits against these generic drug manufacturers in a federal district court, which would trigger a statutory stay precluding the FDA from final approval of the subject ANDA until May 2026 or entry of judgment holding the patents invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed, whichever occurs first in all cases (but not earlier than the expiration of orphan drug exclusivity on November 28, 2025). In that regard, after conducting the necessary due diligence, we filed lawsuits on March 1, 2023 in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against each of the three generic drug manufacturers who notified us of their ANDA submissions, thus triggering the stay.

In June 2024, Lupin converted five of its Paragraph IV Certifications in its ANDA to Paragraph III certifications acknowledging the validity and their ANDA’s infringement of five of those patents, the latest ending in 2034. We subsequently dismissed all of our claims against Lupin related to those five patents but maintain our claims against Lupin for the remaining Paragraph IV certification for U.S. Patent No. 10,626,088, which is the patent expiring in 2037, accordingly the litigation continues.

Further, on January 8, 2025, we reached a settlement with Teva in which Teva agreed not to market a generic version of FIRDAPSE® in the U.S. any earlier than February 25, 2035, if approved by the FDA, unless certain limited circumstances customarily included in these types of agreements occur. In accordance with the settlement agreement, the parties terminated all ongoing patent litigation between us and Teva regarding FIRDAPSE® patents pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey.

The pending FIRDAPSE® patent litigation against the remaining defendants, Hetero (for FIRDAPSE®’s Orange Book-listed patents expiring in 2032, 2034 and 2037) and Lupin (only for FIRDAPSE® patent expiring in 2037), remains ongoing, and

4

Table of Contents

there can be no assurance as to whether the currently ongoing litigation with Hetero and Lupin will allow a generic version of FIRDAPSE® to be marketed in the U.S. prior to Teva's licensed entry into the market on February 25, 2035.

Finally, in October 2023, we received a Paragraph IV Certification Notice Letter from a fourth generic drug manufacturer (Inventia Life Science Pty Ltd (Inventia)), and we filed a similar lawsuit against that manufacturer in November 2023 in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. On July 30, 2024, we settled this patent litigation with Inventia for FIRDAPSE®. In this settlement, Inventia acknowledged both the validity of our FIRDAPSE® patents and also the infringement by the ANDA filer's product of our patents. As part of the settlement, Inventia also agreed not to commercialize its product until the earlier of all FIRDAPSE® patents expiration or the entry into the market of another ANDA product meeting certain conditions.

The outcome of patent litigation with Paragraph IV challengers is always uncertain and there can be no assurance as to whether we will prevail in these litigations.

FYCOMPA®

On December 17, 2022, we entered into an agreement with Eisai Co., Ltd. (Eisai) for the acquisition of the U.S. rights to FYCOMPA® (perampanel) CIII. FYCOMPA® is a selective non-competitive antagonist of AMPA receptors, the major subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors. It was the first, and still the only, drug of its class to be approved for epilepsy. Studies suggest that AMPA receptor antagonism can lead to reduced overstimulation and anticonvulsant effects, as well as inhibiting seizure generation and spread. FYCOMPA® is a controlled substance and is approved with a box warning label. FYCOMPA® is used to treat certain types of focal onset seizures (seizures that involve only one part of the brain) in adults and children four years of age and older. It is also used in combination with other medications to treat certain types of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures (also known as a “grand mal” seizure, a seizure that involves the entire body) in adults and children 12 years of age or older. Perampanel is in a class of medications called anticonvulsants. It works by decreasing abnormal electrical activity in the brain.

On January 24, 2023, we closed our acquisition of the U.S. rights to FYCOMPA®. In connection with the acquisition, we purchased Eisai’s regulatory approvals and documentation, product records, intellectual property, inventory, and other matters relating to the U.S. rights for FYCOMPA®, in exchange for an upfront payment of $160 million in cash. We also agreed to pay Eisai royalty payments after patent protection for FYCOMPA® expires, which royalty payments will be reduced upon generic equivalents to FYCOMPA® entering the market.

In conjunction with the closing of the asset purchase, we entered into two additional agreements, a Transition Services Agreement (TSA) and a Supply Agreement. Under the Supply Agreement, Eisai agreed to manufacture FYCOMPA® for us for at least seven years at prices listed in the Supply Agreement (to be updated on a yearly basis), and under the TSA, a U.S. subsidiary of Eisai provided us with certain transitional services (which transition services ended on December 31, 2023).

We sell FYCOMPA® in the U.S. through a field-based force experienced in epilepsy products consisting at this time of approximately 27 field personnel, including sales (Regional Account Managers) and payor reimbursement (National Account Managers). We also have a field-based force of four medical science liaisons who are helping educate the medical community who treat epilepsy about scientific literature regarding epilepsy and FYCOMPA®. Further, since January 1, 2024, FYCOMPA® is being sold and distributed through a 3PL organization under our contracts.

We are currently taking steps to prepare for the loss of exclusivity for FYCOMPA®, which, assuming a timely ANDA approval of the respective generic applications, will take place on or after May 23, 2025 for the tablet version of the product and will take place on or after December 15, 2025 for the oral suspension version of the product. We expect to continue to market the product following the loss of patent exclusivity.

We are supporting patients using FYCOMPA® through an Instant Savings Card Program. Through the program, eligible commercially insured patients could pay as little as $5 for their FYCOMPA® co-pay (with a maximum savings of $2,500 per year). The FYCOMPA® Instant Savings Card Program is not available to patients enrolled in state or federal healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, VA, DoD, or TRICARE.

Patent protection for FYCOMPA® tablets and oral solution is primarily derived from two patents listed in the FDA’s Orange Book. The first, U.S. patent no. 6,949,571 (the ‘571 patent), will expire on May 23, 2025, including patent term extension. The second FYCOMPA® patent in the Orange Book is U.S. Patent No. 8,772,497 (the ‘497 patent), which will expire on July 1, 2026. The ‘497 patent, which covers the API used in both FYCOMPA® tablets and oral solution, has been the subject of previous Paragraph IV certifications from three ANDA filers for the tablet formulation, which were not contested by Eisai prior to our acquisition of the drug. Following our acquisition of the drug, we attempted to obtain an extension of the patent term for the '571 patent, which was ultimately unsuccessful. As a result, the '571 patent will expire on May 23, 2025 and the initial ANDA filers who did not challenge this patent may seek approval of their ANDA applications on or after that date.

Table of Contents

In February 2023 we received a Paragraph IV certification for the '497 patent from an ANDA filer for two applications, one for the FYCOMPA® tablets and another for the FYCOMPA® oral suspension. After due diligence we filed lawsuits on April 5, 2023 in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the drug manufacturer who notified us of their ANDA submissions alleging infringement of both patents. In June 2024, we settled the pending Paragraph IV litigation with the Paragraph IV filer for both ANDAs. As part of that settlement, this Paragraph IV filer agreed not to commercialize their proposed ANDA products for both the oral suspension formulation of FYCOMPA® and for FYCOMPA® tablets until at least December 15, 2025.

In January 2024, we received a Paragraph IV certification for the ’571 and ’497 patents from an ANDA filer for an application for the FYCOMPA® oral suspension. After due diligence, we determined that the circumstances and timeline did not warrant a lawsuit against this Paragraph IV filer.

AGAMREE®

On June 19, 2023, we entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement (AGAMREE® License Agreement) and an Investment Agreement (Investment Agreement) with Santhera Pharmaceuticals Holding, Inc. (Santhera). Under the AGAMREE® License Agreement, we contracted to obtain an exclusive North America license, manufacturing and supply agreement for Santhera’s investigational product candidate, AGAMREE® (vamorolone), a novel corticosteroid for the treatment of DMD. Under the Investment Agreement, we agreed to make a strategic investment into Santhera.

Both transactions closed on July 18, 2023. Under the AGAMREE® License Agreement, upon closing we made a $75 million payment to Santhera in return for the exclusive North American license for AGAMREE®. In addition to the rights to commercialize the product in North America, the AGAMREE® License Agreement provides us with the right of first negotiation for AGAMREE® in Japan should Santhera pursue partnership opportunities in that territory. Additionally, we will hold the North American rights to any future approved indications for AGAMREE®. Finally, under our AGAMREE® License Agreement with Santhera, we have agreed to purchase commercial supply of AGAMREE® from Santhera at agreed upon prices.

Concurrent with the closing of the AGAMREE® License Agreement, we made a strategic investment into Santhera in which we acquired 1,414,688 of Santhera’s ordinary shares (representing approximately 11.26% of Santhera’s outstanding ordinary shares immediately following the transaction) at an investment price of CHF 9.477 per share, with the approximately $15.7 million USD in equity investment proceeds to be used by Santhera for Phase IV studies of AGAMREE® in DMD and future development of additional indications for AGAMREE®. On February 24, 2025, the closing price of Santhera’s common shares on the SIX Swiss Exchange was CHF 16.08 per share (approximately $17.90 USD based on then-current exchange rates).

On October 26, 2023, the U.S. FDA approved Santhera’s NDA for AGAMREE® for use in treating DMD in patients aged two years and older. Shortly thereafter, as part of the previously described transaction, Santhera transferred the approved NDA to us. Additionally, following approval of the NDA for the drug, we became obligated to make a milestone payment of $36 million to Santhera, which we paid during the fourth quarter of 2023. We may also be obligated to pay future regulatory and commercial milestone payments to Santhera tied to calendar year sales of AGAMREE®, as well as commercial royalties.

On March 13, 2024, utilizing our FIRDAPSE® field-based force, we launched AGAMREE® for the treatment of DMD in the U.S. for patients aged two years or older. During the first quarter of 2024, in connection with our preparation for the commercial launch of AGAMREE®, we incurred substantial commercialization expenses, including sales, marketing, analytical infrastructure, patient services, patient advocacy, and other commercialization related expenses. Initially, we added approximately 10 additional members to our FIRDAPSE® team, and our commercial team marketed both products. However, in early 2025, we made a strategic decision to split our commercial field-based force into two units, one expressly focused on the marketing of FIRDAPSE® and one expressly focused on the marketing of AGAMREE®. This change is expected to allow us to better focus on the market for each product. We expect to complete this division of our field-based force into two units early in the second quarter of 2025.

We are further supporting the distribution of AGAMREE® through our Catalyst Pathways® patient services program to ensure that patients have access to a dedicated, personalized support team that assists families through the AGAMREE® patient journey, from answering questions to coordinating financial assistance programs for eligible patients. Finally, we have donated and intend to continue to donate funds to one or more qualified, independent charitable financial foundations who assist U.S. DMD patients in financial need for paying the costs of care including medication, to the extent permitted by each such organization's guidelines.

DMD, the most common form of muscular dystrophy, is a rare and life-threatening neuromuscular disorder characterized by progressive muscle dysfunction, ultimately leading to loss of ambulation, respiratory failure, and fatality. Current standard treatment for DMD involves corticosteroids, which often come with significant side effects. It is estimated that between 11,000 and 13,000 patients in the U.S. are affected by DMD, with approximately 70% of patients currently receiving a corticosteroid

treatment. Steroids are expected to remain the foundation of therapy for DMD patients and dosed concomitantly with other therapies.

AGAMREE®’s unique mode of action is based on differential effects on glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors and modifying further downstream activity. As such, it is considered a novel corticosteroid that we hope has the potential to demonstrate comparable efficacy to corticosteroids, with the potential for a better-tolerated side effect profile. This mechanism of action may allow vamorolone to emerge as an effective alternative to the current standard of care corticosteroids in children, adolescents, and adult patients with DMD. In that regard, we have launched our SUMMIT study to evaluate data about long-term patient safety and quality of life data from the use of our product, with the hope of offering a deeper understanding of the product's potential long-term benefits for patients.

On October 13, 2023, Santhera announced that the European Union’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive position in favor of AGAMREE® for the treatment of DMD patients aged four and older. In its recommendation for approval, CHMP acknowledged that there was a positive benefit-risk profile of AGAMREE® in such patient population, including certain safety benefits of AGAMREE® compared to standard of care corticosteroids in the treatment of DMD. Further, on December 18, 2023, the European Commission (EC) granted to Santhera marketing authorization for AGAMREE® for the treatment of DMD in patents ages four years and older and on January 12, 2024 Santhera announced that AGAMREE®

had received approval by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the United Kingdom. Further, on January 15, 2024, Santhera announced that AGAMREE® was commercially launched in Germany. Finally, On January 16, 2025, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) issued positive Final Guidance that recommends AGAMREE® for use in the National Health Service (NHS) in England, Wales and Northern Ireland for the treatment of DMD in patients four years of age and older and on February 13, 2025, Santhera announced an agreement with the German National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Funds (GKV-SV) on the reimbursement for AGAMREE® (vamorolone) for the treatment of DMD. This milestone makes AGAMREE® the first product to receive an agreed federal price in Germany for the treatment of DMD in patients 4 years of age and older, independent of the underlying genetic mutation.

We are currently taking the first steps to seek to expand the number of diseases that can be treated with AGAMREE®. In furtherance of that objective, we are currently conducting a Phase 1 study in healthy adults comparing a single dose of vamorolone, prednisone, and deflazacort, and studying the immunosuppressive effect of multiple ascending doses of AGAMREE®, which study will attempt to define the immunosuppressive dose of vamorolone for future indications and for the use of our product in conjunction with gene and cell therapies that are approved to treat DMD and require a concurrent immunosuppressive regimen of a corticosteroid when administered. We expect to have the results of this study around the middle of this year and hope that the results of this study will provide important information for use in marketing our product to healthcare practitioners in an effort to help with the treatment of patients. We have also begun a long-term project to undertake long-term research and development efforts for the product.

Further, we have established a joint steering committee with Santhera that is overseeing the lifecycle management and development of AGAMREE®. There can be no assurance that we can develop our product for the treatment of diseases other than DMD.

In the U.S., AGAMREE® has New Chemical Entity exclusivity that expires in October 2028. AGAMREE® also has Orphan Drug Exclusivity expiring in October 2030. AGAMREE® is further protected by seven Orange Book listed patents expiring as early as May 28, 2029 and as late as July 16, 2040. The Company has also requested Patent Term Extension and will update the relevant expiration date in the Orange Book upon a final determination by the USPTO. The earliest a generic manufacturer could submit an ANDA is October 26, 2027. If we were to pursue a patent infringement action if any such ANDA challenges any of AGAMREE®’s Orange Book patents, then the automatic statutory 30-month stay would prevent FDA approval of such ANDA until April 26, 2031.

Finally, on July 23, 2024 we entered into a license, supply and commercialization agreement with KYE, which is already our sublicensee for FIRDAPSE® in Canada, granting KYE the exclusive Canadian commercial rights to market AGAMREE® in Canada for DMD and other indications. Under the agreement, KYE is responsible for obtaining regulatory approval of the product from Health Canada (of which there can be no assurance), and we will supply product to KYE. Further, KYE has advised us that they expect to file an application with Health Canada seeking approval to commercialize AGAMREE® in Canada during the first quarter of 2025.

There can be no assurance that any such application when and if filed will be approved, and even if such application is approved that KYE will be successful in commercializing AGAMREE® in Canada.

Business Development

We continue to advance our strategic initiatives and portfolio expansion efforts, focusing on broadening and diversifying our rare (orphan) neurology product portfolio with innovative therapies that address critical unmet medical needs and expanding the geographical footprint of our existing products. In that regard, we are currently exploring clinically differentiated and

7

Table of Contents

adequately de-risked opportunities, with a keen focus on orphan, rare disease products across therapeutic areas. These prospects include evaluating companies with existing commercial drug products or drugs in development, for potential partnerships, licensing, geographical expansion opportunities with our existing products, and/or asset acquisitions. We continue to employ a disciplined, comprehensive, and exhaustive approach to identifying and evaluating opportunities that we believe will add significant value to our company over the near, mid, and long term. However, other than the recent sublicense agreement described above between the Company and KYE for AGAMREE® in Canada, no definitive agreements have been entered into to-date, and there can be no assurance that any of the Company's business development initiatives will be successful.

Capital Resources

At December 31, 2024, we had cash and investments of approximately $517.6 million. Based on our current financial condition, including our profitability, cash flows generated from operations and forecasts of available cash, we believe that we have sufficient funds to support our operations for at least the next 12 months. There can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in commercializing FIRDAPSE® and AGAMREE®, that our projections about the commercialization of FYCOMPA® after the expiration of its patents will be correct, or that we will continue to be profitable and cash flow positive. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for further information on our liquidity and cash flow.

Our Strategy

Our goal is to implement our buy-and-build strategy, acquiring and integrating high-value, orphan designated, synergistic assets. We are dedicated to making a meaningful impact on the lives of those suffering from rare diseases, and we believe in putting patients first in everything we do. Specifically, we intend to:

•
Continue to commercialize FIRDAPSE® for the treatment of LEMS and improve disease awareness. We are currently commercializing FIRDAPSE® in the U.S. and Canada. We are working to expand awareness of the disease, including to physicians treating LEMS patients who also have small-cell lung cancer, and helping health care providers and their patients understand the benefits of FIRDAPSE®. A cornerstone of our strategy is our continuing development of Catalyst Pathways®, our personalized treatment support program, and our development of the patient assistance programs that are required to further our goal that no LEMS patient be denied access to FIRDAPSE® for financial reasons within existing legal restrictions. 

•
Continue to commercialize AGAMREE® for the treatment of DMD and seek to develop additional indications for the product. We are currently marketing AGAMREE® in the U.S. for the treatment of DMD. We are also hoping to evaluate our product for the treatment of other diseases and in furtherance of that objective we are currently taking steps that will help us in that goal, including our current Phase 1 trial to evaluate AGAMREE® against other steroids in an effort to first evaluate the dose equivalence between AGAMREE®, prednisone and deflazacort) and the immunosuppressive dose of AGAMREE®. We are also conducting the SUMMIT study in an effort to obtain real world data about the benefits of AGAMREE® over other corticosteroids.

•
Seek to expand the market for FIRDAPSE® and AGAMREE®. We are continuing our efforts to expand the footprint for FIRDAPSE® into Asia and Latin America and maintain our Right of First Negotiation with Santhera for rights to AGAMREE® in Japan.

•
Seek to acquire additional products. We intend to continue our efforts to broaden and diversify our product portfolio through acquisitions of early and/or late-stage products or companies or technology platforms in orphan, rare disease therapeutic categories. To accomplish these priorities, we are continuing to employ a disciplined approach to evaluating assets and we believe that this strategic expansion will better position our company to build out a broader, more diversified portfolio of drug candidates, which should add greater value to our company over the near and long-term. 

FIRDAPSE® Product Overview

FIRDAPSE® is Catalyst’s registered trade name in the U.S. for amifampridine phosphate tablets. Amifampridine is the WHO (World Health Organization) registered INN (International Nonproprietary Name) and U.S. Adopted Name (USAN) for the chemical entity, 3,4-diaminopyridine, often abbreviated as 3,4-DAP or DAP. FIRDAPSE® contains the phosphate salt of amifampridine, hence the name “amifampridine phosphate.” We will refer to our drug by its trade name in the U.S. (FIRDAPSE®), by the INN and USAN (amifampridine), or by the specific salt in our product (amifampridine phosphate), throughout this report.

Amifampridine has been recommended as the first-line symptomatic treatment for LEMS by the European Federation of Neurological Societies (now known as the European Academy of Neurology). In December 2009, amifampridine phosphate received marketing approval from the European Commission (with the trade name FIRDAPSE®) for the symptomatic treatment of patients with LEMS. Safety data from clinical data published over the last 30 years in patients with LEMS or other

Table of Contents

neurological disorders treated with amifampridine show that amifampridine is well tolerated at doses up to 80 mg per day. Among the 1,279 patients or healthy subjects assessed in the literature, the most frequently reported adverse events (AEs) were perioral and peripheral paresthesias (unusual sensations like pins and needles), and gastrointestinal disorders (abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, and epigastralgia (pain around the upper part of the stomach)). These events were typically mild or moderate in severity, and transient, seldom requiring dose reduction or withdrawal from treatment.

Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS)

LEMS is a rare autoimmune neuromuscular disorder characterized primarily by muscle weakness of the limbs. The disease is caused by an autoimmune reaction where antibodies are formed against voltage-gated calcium channels on nerve endings, which damages the channels. These calcium channels are responsible for the transport of charged calcium atoms that activate the biochemical machinery responsible for releasing acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter responsible for causing muscles to contract and the failure to release enough of this neurotransmitter results in muscle weakness in LEMS patients. Additionally, LEMS is often associated with an underlying malignancy, most commonly small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), and in some individuals, LEMS is the first symptom of such malignancy.

LEMS generally affects individuals' extremities, especially the legs. As LEMS most affects the parts of limbs closest to the trunk, difficulties with climbing stairs or rising from a sitting position are commonly reported. Physical exercise and high temperatures tend to worsen the symptoms. Other symptoms often seen include weakness of the muscles of the mouth, throat, and eyes. Individuals affected with LEMS also may have a disruption of the autonomic nervous system, including dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, impaired sweating, and/or hypotension.

LEMS is managed by treating the symptoms or treating the underlying autoimmune attack on voltage gated calcium channels. Unapproved treatments include steroids, azathioprine and intravenous immunoglobulin, which work by suppressing the immune system; and pyridostigmine and amifampridine, which enhance neuromuscular transmission. Plasma exchange has also been used to attempt to remove antibodies from the body. FIRDAPSE® is a symptomatic treatment and does not alter the underlying autoimmune condition. As a voltage gated potassium blocker, FIRDAPSE® prevents charged potassium atoms from leaving the nerve cells, which prolongs the period of depolarization. This allows more charged calcium atoms to enter the nerves, which enables the nerves to release acetylcholine and causes muscles to contract and to restore lost muscle strength in LEMS patients.

Based on currently available information, we estimate that there are at least 3,600 LEMS patients in the U.S., approximately half of which we believe are presently diagnosed and identified and the remainder of which we believe are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. However, until awareness of the disease is increased, it is unlikely that the total number of LEMS patients in the U.S. can be determined with better certainty (as is typical of rare diseases), and the actual number of patients in the U.S. with LEMS may be higher or lower than our estimate.

Some of the factors that affect the addressable size of the population with a rare disease such as LEMS include the number of patients actually diagnosed with the disease, the number of patients who are misdiagnosed with other diseases, and the number of patients who are simply undiagnosed. Additionally, while there is an antibody test that positively identifies patients with LEMS which we offer at no cost to health-care providers to be used to definitively determine whether a patient has LEMS, the test is not particularly well known or utilized at this time by many neurologists. Further, many LEMS patients who have small cell lung cancer (SCLC) are not currently being treated for LEMS because many oncology medical professionals who treat SCLC patients are generally unfamiliar with how to diagnose and treat LEMS. All of these factors affect the ultimate number of patients who will benefit from treatment with FIRDAPSE®.

License Agreements for FIRDAPSE®

License Agreement with BioMarin

On October 26, 2012, we licensed the exclusive North American rights to FIRDAPSE® pursuant to a License Agreement (the License Agreement) between us and BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (BioMarin). Under the License Agreement, we make the following royalty payments on our net sales of FIRDAPSE®:

●	Royalties to the licensor for seven years from the first commercial sale of FIRDAPSE® equal to 7% of net sales (as defined in the License Agreement) in North America for any calendar year for sales up to $100 million, and 10% of net sales in North America in any calendar year in excess of $100 million; and

●	Royalties to the third party licensor of the rights sublicensed to us for seven years from the first commercial sale of FIRDAPSE® equal to 7% of net sales (as defined in the License Agreement between BioMarin and the third party licensor) in any calendar year for the duration of any pending or issued patents or regulatory exclusivity within a territory and 3.5% of net sales in any calendar year in territories without pending or issued patents or regulatory exclusivity.

Table of Contents

On May 29, 2019, we entered into an amendment to the License Agreement. Under the amendment, we expanded our commercial territory for FIRDAPSE®, which originally was comprised of North America, to include Japan. Additionally, in December 2023 our territory automatically expanded to include most of Asia, as well as Central and South America, upon the acceptance by the MHLW in Japan of an application to market our product in Japan. Under the amendment, we will pay royalties on net sales in Japan of a similar percentage to the royalties that we are currently paying under our original License Agreement for North America.

In January 2020, we were advised that BioMarin had sold certain rights under the License Agreement to SERB SA.  We believe that we remain in compliance with our obligations under the License Agreement.

License Agreement with Jacobus

In May 2019, the FDA approved an NDA for RUZURGI®, Jacobus Pharmaceuticals’ version of amifampridine (3,4-DAP), for the treatment of pediatric LEMS patients (ages 6 to under 17). In June 2019 we filed suit against the FDA and several related parties challenging this approval and related drug labeling. Jacobus later intervened in the case. We ultimately prevailed in our litigation in September 2021, when U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11
th
 Circuit determined that the FDA’s approval of RUZURGI® violated our rights to Orphan Drug Exclusivity.

On July 11, 2022, we settled our disputes with Jacobus. In connection with the settlement, we licensed the rights to develop and commercialize RUZURGI® in the U.S. and Mexico. Simultaneously, we purchased, among other intellectual property rights, Jacobus’ U.S. patents related to RUZURGI®, its NDAs in the U.S. for RUZURGI®, and certain RUZURGI®

inventory previously manufactured by Jacobus. At the same time, we received a license from Jacobus for use of its know-how related to the manufacture of RUZURGI®. Further, we settled our pending patent lawsuit against Jacobus, which has been dismissed without prejudice. Finally, Jacobus agreed that until the later of (i) the expiration of the royalty term or (ii) December 31, 2034, Jacobus and its affiliates, will not, directly or indirectly, research, develop, manufacture, commercialize, distribute, use or otherwise exploit any product competitive to FIRDAPSE® or RUZURGI®

in the U.S. and Mexico, and Laura Jacobus, the sole shareholder of Jacobus, and two of Jacobus’ other officers, also signed individual non-competition agreements containing the same terms.

In connection with the settlement with Jacobus, we paid Jacobus $30 million of cash, of which $10 million was paid at the closing of the settlement on July 11, 2022, $10 million was paid on the first anniversary of the closing of the settlement, and the remainder was paid on the second anniversary of closing. We also pay Jacobus an annual royalty on our net sales (as defined in the License and Asset Purchase Agreement between us and Jacobus) of amifampridine products in the U.S. equal to: (a) for calendar years 2022 through 2025, 1.5% (with a minimum annual royalty of $3.0 million per year), and (b) for calendar years 2026 through the expiration of the last to expire of Catalyst’s FIRDAPSE®

patents in the U.S., 2.5% (with a minimum annual royalty of $5 million per year); provided, however, that the royalty rate may be reduced and the minimum annual royalty may be eliminated under certain circumstances. Royalties will be trued up at the end of the year to the extent that royalties on net sales are below the minimum royalty.

Clinical Trials Supporting our NDA for FIRDAPSE® for LEMS and Approval of our NDA

We conducted two successful Phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials evaluating FIRDAPSE®

for the treatment of LEMS. The results of the first trial published in 2016 in Muscle & Nerve (Muscle Nerve, 2016, 53(5):717-725). The results of the second trial were published in March 2019 in the Journal of Clinical Neuromuscular Disease (J. Clin Neuromusc Dis 2019; 20:111-119). In March 2018, we submitted an NDA seeking approval of FIRDAPSE® for the treatment of LEMS. Our NDA was accepted for filing in May 2018 and, on November 28, 2018, the FDA granted approval of FIRDAPSE® for the treatment of LEMS in adult patients.

On September 29, 2022, the FDA approved our sNDA to expand the indicated age range for FIRDAPSE® for the treatment of LEMS to include pediatric patients, six years of age and older.  Further, on May 30, 2024, the FDA approved our sNDA increasing the indicated maximum daily dose of FIRDAPSE® for adults and pediatric patients weighing more than 45 kg from 80 mg to 100 mg for the treatment of LEMS.

Required Post-Approval Studies

As part of the approval of our NDA for FIRDAPSE® for LEMS, the FDA required us to conduct two studies.  The first was a clinical trial to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the exposure of amifampridine after oral administration of FIRDAPSE® relative to that in subjects with normal hepatic function. The second was to perform a second carcinogenicity study of amifampridine phosphate in mice. Both have been completed and submitted to the FDA which considers these commitments complete. For a third commitment, we have also established a pregnancy surveillance program to collect and analyze information for a minimum of 10 years on pregnancy complications and birth outcomes related to FIRDAPSE®. Finally, in connection with the approval of our sNDA for FIRDAPSE® for the treatment of children ages six through seventeen with LEMS, we are currently conducting a pediatric safety study of juvenile toxicity in a rodent.

Compassionate Use Programs

We continue to make FIRDAPSE® available to a limited number of patients diagnosed with congenital myasthenic syndromes or Downbeat Nystagmus through investigator-sponsored compassionate use programs. Further, when we acquired the U.S. rights to RUZURGI® in July 2022, we agreed to continue to supply RUZURGI®

to these patients with neuromuscular conditions other than LEMS who are without access to an approved drug and were being treated with RUZURGI® under investigator-sponsored INDs at the time of our settlement with Jacobus. However, this program has recently been discontinued because the API for RUZURGI® is no longer available and we are therefore unable to manufacture additional product.

Sales, Marketing and Distribution

Marketing of FIRDAPSE®

In January 2019, we launched FIRDAPSE®

in the U.S. We currently sell FIRDAPSE® in the U.S. through a field-based force experienced in neurologic, central nervous system or rare disease products consisting at this time of approximately 40 field personnel, including sales (Regional Account Managers), thought leader liaisons and patient assistance and insurance navigation support (Patient Access Liaisons). We also have a field-based force of nine medical science liaisons who are helping educate the medical community about scientific literature concerning LEMS and FIRDAPSE®. Additionally, we use non-personal promotion to reach the 20,000 neurologists who are potential LEMS treaters and the 16,000 oncologists who might be treating a LEMS patient who also has small cell lung cancer. Further, we continue to make available at no-cost a LEMS voltage gated calcium channel antibody diagnostic testing program for use by physicians who suspect that one of their patients may have LEMS and wish to reach a definitive diagnosis.

When we launched AGAMREE®, in March 2024, we utilized the FIRDAPSE® commercial field-based force for AGAMREE® as well. In early 2025, we made a strategic decision to split our commercial field-based force into two units, one expressly focused on the marketing of FIRDAPSE® and one expressly focused on the marketing of AGAMREE®. This change will allow us to better focus on the market for each product. We expect to complete this division of our field-based force into two units by early in the second quarter of 2025.

We are supporting the distribution of FIRDAPSE® through Catalyst Pathways®, our personalized treatment support program. Catalyst Pathways® is a single source for personalized treatment support, education and guidance through the challenging dosing and titration regimen to an effective therapeutic dose. It also includes distributing the drug through a very small group of exclusive specialty pharmacies (primarily AnovoRx), which is consistent with the way that most pharmaceutical products for ultra-orphan diseases are distributed and dispensed to patients. By using specialty pharmacies in this way, the difficult task of navigating the health care system is far better for the patient needing treatment for their rare disease and the health care community in general.

In addition, Catalyst Pathways® is the gateway for our free bridge medication for patients transitioning from investigational product while they are waiting for a coverage determination or, later on, for patients whose access is threatened by the bureaucratic complications arising from a change of insurer. The Catalyst Pathways® program is also the access point for our Patient Assistance Program, which provides longer-term free medication for those who are uninsured or functionally uninsured with respect to FIRDAPSE® because they may be unable to obtain coverage from their payer despite having health insurance.

We are continuing efforts on the challenging process to identify patients and their physicians who have diagnosed LEMS, but have not had access, awareness or understanding of this treatment for their rare disease. These patients often do not see their physician frequently, have many questions about changing treatment(s), and may not perceive the need to change to a new therapy. Further, we have begun to focus our commercial efforts to locate misdiagnosed and undiagnosed LEMS patients and provide educational and sales activities to help improve the diagnosis, understanding of the treatment, and information on the prescribing process. We plan to continue to support LEMS and rare disease patient organizational groups’ efforts to generate awareness and educate patients and physicians on the diagnosis of LEMS, the impact of the disease, and the support services and treatments available.

Access to FIRDAPSE®

In order to help patients afford their medication, we, like other pharmaceutical companies who are marketing drugs for ultra-orphan conditions, have developed an array of financial assistance programs that are available to reduce patient co-pays and deductibles to a nominal affordable amount. For eligible patients with commercial coverage, a co-pay assistance program designed to keep out-of-pocket costs to $10 or less per month (currently $0.00 per month) is available for all LEMS patients prescribed FIRDAPSE®. We are also donating, and committing to continue to donate, money to qualified, independent charitable foundations dedicated to providing assistance to LEMS patients in financial need. Our goal is to ensure that no LEMS patient is ever denied access to their medication for financial reasons.

To date, FIRDAPSE®

has been widely covered and reimbursed by private and public payors for the indicated small population of adult and pediatric LEMS patients.

Canadian Market

We market FIRDAPSE®

for the treatment of LEMS in Canada through a sublicensee, KYE. Our product was approved for commercialization in Canada in 2020.

Japanese Market

In May 2019, we entered into an amendment to our license agreement for FIRDAPSE® with BioMarin. Under the amendment, we expanded our commercial territory for FIRDAPSE®, which originally was comprised of North America, to include Japan. Further, we were granted orphan drug designation in Japan for FIRDAPSE® for the symptomatic treatment of LEMS.

On June 28, 2021, we entered into a sub-license agreement with DyDo Pharma, Inc., or DyDo, pursuant to which we sub-licensed to DyDo the Japanese rights for FIRDAPSE® for the treatment of LEMS. In December 2021, we announced that DyDo had initiated a Phase 3 registrational study in Japan to evaluate the efficacy and safety of FIRDAPSE® for the treatment of LEMS. In December 2023, DyDo submitted a Japan NDA for FIRDAPSE® to the PMDA.  On September 24, 2024, DyDo informed us that the MHLW of Japan has approved their New Drug Application for FIRDAPSE® for the treatment of LEMS and DyDo began commercialization of FIRDAPSE® in Japan on January 21, 2025.

Future Markets for FIRDAPSE®

Under the amendment to our license agreement that added Japan to our territory, our territory in which we have the right to seek to commercialize FIRDAPSE® has automatically expanded to include several countries in Asia-Pacific and South and Central America, and we are working to expand our FIRDAPSE®

activities into some of these.

Intellectual property and regulatory exclusivity protections for FIRDAPSE®

The bulk of our patent rights related to FIRDAPSE® are derived from our license agreement with BioMarin, which was transferred to SERB in 2020. In August 2020, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) allowed Patent No. 10,793,893 (the ’893 patent) to our licensor and thereby to us, and the patent issued on October 6, 2020. The patent is directed to the use of suitable doses of amifampridine to treat patients, regardless of the therapeutic indication, that are slow metabolizers of amifampridine. Any drug product containing amifampridine with a label that states the patented dosing regimens and doses in the Dosing and Administration section prior to May 26, 2034, the expiration date of the patent, could possibly infringe this patent. Generic drug product labels would necessarily have to do this, and we intend to take all appropriate actions to protect our intellectual property.

In April 2021, the USPTO also allowed a further application in the family of licensed intellectual property, and this second patent, Patent No. 11,060,128 (the ’128 patent), issued on July 13, 2021. The patent is directed to the use of suitable doses of amifampridine to treat patients suffering with LEMS that are slow metabolizers of amifampridine. Any drug product containing amifampridine with a label for the treatment of LEMS, that states the patented dosing regimens and doses in the Dosing and Administration section of a product label, including generic drug product labels, could possibly infringe this patent prior to this patent’s expiration date.

Additional patents claiming priority from the patents noted above issued in March 2022 as Patent Nos. 11,268,128, 11,274,332, and 11,274,331, and extended our patent coverage to include fast metabolizers of amifampridine. These patents are now listed in the Orange Book for FIRDAPSE®.

As part of our transaction with Jacobus Pharmaceuticals, we also acquired two patents. One of these patents, 10,626,088 issued by the USPTO on April 21, 2020, was suitable for listing in the Orange Book and has now been listed in further support of FIRDAPSE®.

On December 19, 2023 and January 16, 2024, the USPTO issued Patent Nos. 11,845,977 and 11,873,525, respectively. These new patents cover methods of treating LEMS with FIRDAPSE® under fasting and fed conditions of dosing. We are also pursuing additional patent applications for FIRDAPSE® in an effort to further protect our drug product.

There can be no assurance that we do not or will not infringe on patents held by third parties or that third parties in the future will not claim that we have infringed on their patents. In the event that our products or technologies infringe or violate the patent or other proprietary rights of third parties, we may be prevented from pursuing product development, manufacturing or commercialization of our products that utilize such technologies. For example, there may be patents or patent applications held by others that contain claims that our products or operations might be determined to infringe or that may be broader than we believe them to be. Given the complexities and uncertainties of patent laws, there can be no assurance as to the impact that future patent claims against us may have on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects.

Until FIRDAPSE® was approved in November 2018, no drug product containing amifampridine for any indication had been approved by the FDA such that we received five-year “new chemical entity” exclusivity from the FDA. New chemical entity exclusivity provides a five-year period of marketing exclusivity for all indications and in the absence of an Orange Book listed

12

Table of Contents

patent, precludes a generic from submitting an ANDA until that five-year period has expired. Further, when FIRDAPSE® was approved for the treatment of LEMS patients, we received seven-year orphan drug exclusivity (ODE) for our product for the treatment of LEMS, precluding a generic filer from receiving final FDA approval until the ODE exclusivity period has expired. Because we have Orange Book listed patents for FIRDAPSE®, potential generic filers were permitted to submit ANDA filings to the FDA starting on the “NCE-1” date (November 28, 2022).

For a description of currently ongoing Paragraph IV litigation related to FIRDAPSE®, see “
