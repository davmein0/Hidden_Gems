Our commercial products, including those sold by or through our subsidiaries, include: 
Qelbree
®
Qelbree (viloxazine extended-release capsules) is a novel non-stimulant product indicated for the treatment of ADHD in adults and pediatric patients 6 years and older. On April 2, 2021, the FDA approved Qelbree for the treatment of ADHD in pediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age. In May 2021, the Company launched Qelbree for pediatric patients in the U.S. On April 29, 2022, the FDA approved Qelbree for treatment of ADHD in adult patients. The Company launched Qelbree for adult patients in May 2022. In January 2025, the FDA approved an expanded label update for Qelbree to include new data on the pharmacodynamics and use in breastfeeding mothers.
GOCOVRI
®
GOCOVRI (amantadine) extended-release capsules is the first and only FDA-approved medicine indicated for the treatment of dyskinesia in patients with PD receiving levodopa-based therapy, with or without concomitant dopaminergic medications, and as an adjunctive treatment to levodopa/carbidopa in patients with PD experiencing "OFF" episodes. 
GOCOVRI was approved by the FDA in August 2017 for treatment of dyskinesia and in February 2021 as an adjunctive treatment for "OFF" episodes. The February 2021 update to the label indication makes GOCOVRI the only medicine clinically proven and approved to reduce both "OFF" episodes and dyskinesia in PD patients taking a levodopa-based medication, resulting in a clinically meaningful increase in good "on" time without the need for a "trade-off' when managing these motor complications.
Oxtellar XR
®
Oxtellar XR is indicated for treatment of partial-onset seizure in adults and children 6 years of age and older. Oxtellar XR is the first once-daily extended-release oxcarbazepine product indicated for the treatment of epilepsy in the U.S. market. In 2013, we launched Oxtellar XR for adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures in adults and children 6 to 17 years of age. In January 2019, we launched Oxtellar XR for monotherapy treatment of partial onset epilepsy seizures in adults and children 6 to 17 years of age.
APOKYN
®
APOKYN (apomorphine hydrochloride injection) is a product indicated for the acute, intermittent treatment of hypomobility or "OFF" episodes ("end-of-dose wearing off" and unpredictable "on-off" episodes) in patients with advanced PD. APOKYN's adjustable dose subcutaneous injection pen is designed to quickly and reliably reverse the effects of oral levodopa wearing off in patients with inadequately controlled PD.

Trokendi XR
®
Trokendi XR is indicated for (1) epilepsy: initial monotherapy for the treatment of partial-onset and primary generalized tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizure in patients 6 years of age and older (1.1); adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset, primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, or seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome in patients 6 years of age and older (1.2); and for (2) preventive treatment of migraine in patients 12 years of age and older. Trokendi XR is the first once-daily extended-release topiramate product indicated for the treatment of epilepsy and the prophylaxis of migraine headaches in adults and adolescents in the U.S. market.
XADAGO
®
XADAGO (safinamide) is a once-daily product indicated as adjunctive treatment to levodopa/carbidopa in patients with PD who are experiencing "OFF" episodes. XADAGO is a monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor that works by blocking the catabolism of dopamine, which is believed to result in an increase in dopamine levels, and therefore a subsequent increase in dopaminergic activity in the brain. XADAGO was approved by the FDA in March 2017.
The Company has entered into settlement agreements with third parties permitting the sale of a generic version of XADAGO beginning in December 2027, or sooner under certain conditions. For more information, refer to

ONAPGO (formerly SPN-830)
ONAPGO (apomorphine hydrochloride) injection is the first and only subcutaneous apomorphine infusion device for the treatment of motor fluctuations in adults with advanced PD. ONAPGO was approved by the FDA in February 2025 and received an Orphan Drug Designation. ONAPGO will be launched in the second quarter of 2025. 
The approval of ONAPGO is based on results from a Phase 3, twelve-week, multicenter, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study (N=107) evaluating the efficacy and safety of ONAPGO. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change in total daily "OFF" time assessed from baseline to the end of the twelve-week treatment period based on patient diaries. The key secondary endpoints were the mean change in daily GOOD ON time, which was defined as ON time without troublesome dyskinesia, and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC).
During the Phase 3 study, ONAPGO significantly reduced the amount of daily "OFF" time at twelve weeks from baseline (p=0.0114), with ONAPGO-treated patients (n=53) experiencing a 2.6-hour reduction compared to placebo (n=51) with 0.9 hours. The reduction in daily "OFF" time was accompanied by a similar significant increase in daily GOOD ON time (2.8 hours for ONAPGO-treated patients compared to 1.1 hours for the placebo group; p=0.0188). In addition, numerically greater improvements in daily "OFF" time and daily GOOD ON time were seen as early as the first week of treatment and were maintained throughout all measured timepoints. Additionally, ONAPGO-treated patients more frequently reported improvement in their state of general health compared with placebo-treated patients (PGIC: 79% vs. 24%; p<0.0001). The most common adverse events (≥10% incidence) were infusion-site nodule, nausea, somnolence, infusion-site erythema, dyskinesia, headache, and insomnia.
SPN-817 (huperzine A)
SPN-817 represents a novel MOA for an anticonvulsant. SPN-817 is a novel synthetic form of huperzine A, whose MOA includes potent acetylcholinesterase inhibition, with pharmacological activities in CNS conditions such as epilepsy. The development will initially focus on the drug's anticonvulsant activity, which has been shown in preclinical models to be effective 
7
Table of Contents
for the treatment of partial seizures and Dravet Syndrome. SPN-817 has received Orphan Drug Designation for both Dravet Syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome from the FDA.
We are focused on completing and optimizing the synthesis process of the synthetic drug as well as developing a novel dosage form. Given the potency of SPN-817 (huperzine A), a novel extended-release oral dosage form is critical to the success of this program because initial studies with the immediate-release formulations of non-synthetic SPN-817 (huperzine A) have shown serious dose-limiting, side effects.
We are conducting an open-label Phase 2a clinical study of SPN-817 in patients with treatment-resistant seizures. The first part of this study (Stage A) has completed dosing in the titration and maintenance  periods. We have completed enrollment of Stage A and announced in     November 2024 the topline data from all subjects with focal seizures who received the 3mg and 4mg twice daily doses, completed the maintenance period (n=10), and enrolled in the post-maintenance extension period (n=6). 
•
Maintenance period:
◦
56% median seizure reduction from baseline.
◦
70% of subjects had 30% or more seizure reduction.
◦
60% of subjects had 50% or more seizure reduction.
◦
30% of subjects had 75% or more seizure reduction.
•
Post-maintenance extension period:
◦
66% median seizure reduction from baseline.
◦
83% of subjects had 30% or more seizure reduction.
◦
67% of subjects had 50% or more seizure reduction.
◦
50% of subjects had 75% or more seizure reduction.
•
Seizure Freedom:
◦
Maintenance period: 1 out of 10 subjects (10%) who completed a post-baseline seizure diary had at least one four-week seizure free period.
◦
Post-maintenance extension period: 1 out of 6 subjects (17%) had at least one four-week seizure free period.
Assessment by EpiTrack®, a validated cognitive screening tool designed for patients with epilepsy, indicated that 75% of 16 subjects was equally split between those who improved and those who had no change in cognitive function. SPN-817 was safe and had acceptable tolerability with 2 subjects discontinuing because of treatment related adverse events out of the 26 subjects who entered the maintenance period. The second part of this study (Stage B) is on-going and includes the use of a concomitant anti-emetic to reduce the cholinergic adverse events observed in the study. 
We initiated a Phase 2b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 3mg and 4mg twice daily doses in approximately 258 adult patients with treatment resistant focal seizures.
SPN-820 (NV-5138) 
SPN-820 is a first-in-class, orally active small molecule that activates the brain mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a gatekeeper of cellular metabolism and renewal. SPN-820 binds to and modulates sestrin, which senses amino acid availability in the brain, a potent natural activator of mTORC1.
Depression is associated with synapse loss and reduced synaptic plasticity in key brain regions including the prefrontal cortex and increasing mTORC1-mediated synaptic plasticity is a promising avenue to treat depression and associated symptoms. SPN-820 selectively binds to intracellular sestrin proteins and subsequently engages a cascade of multi-protein complexes, enhancing mTORC1 signaling. A single administration of SPN-820 rapidly (on within one hour) and transiently (off within seven hours) enhances intracellular mTORC1 signaling in the prefrontal cortex of animals, restores levels of synaptic proteins, reducing depressive-like behaviors in a brain-derived neurotrophic factor "BDNF"-dependent manner. The rapid and transient enhancement of mTORC1 signaling in the prefrontal cortex is required for anti-depressant effects in preclinical animal models. The intracellular mechanism of SPN-820, and the lack of binding to cell surface receptors, suggests the potential for a differentiated safety profile.
A Phase 1 trial demonstrated early proof of concept in which a single dose of SPN-820 showed a rapid and sustained improvement in core symptoms, with favorable safety and tolerability in patients with treatment resistant depression. We believe the novel mechanism of action (MOA) in depression may improve symptoms of depression in patients who have failed other

agents. 
We completed a Phase 2a multi-center open label study in 40 subjects with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in the fourth quarter of 2024. The data were based on 40 enrolled subjects, of which 38 completed the ten-day treatment period. The primary objective of the study was to assess efficacy in MDD, as well as the onset of efficacy. The Phase 2a study demonstrated rapid and substantial decrease in depressive symptoms, and 80% decrease in suicidal ideation. SPN-820 was well-tolerated during the study with few adverse events reported by the subjects. In addition, the data demonstrated a rapid Montgomery–Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) response rate (≥50% reduction) and remission (MADRS ≤10), reaching 50.0% and 35.0% of subjects, respectively, at 4 hours, with additional improvement to 84.2% and 63.2% of participants by Day 10.  
In February 2025, we reported topline results from the Phase 2b study of SPN-820. The Phase 2b study of SPN-820 in adults with treatment-resistant depression did not demonstrate a statistically significant improvement on the primary endpoint of change from baseline in the MADRS total score to Week 4 (SPN-820 [LS mean ± Standard Error]: -12.3 ± 0.96 vs. placebo: -11.9 ± 0.96; p = not significant). There was no treatment difference between SPN-820 and placebo in the change from baseline to Week 4 for the secondary endpoints. The safety profile of SPN-820 was consistent with previous clinical trials, showing few adverse events.
The Phase 2b study was a multi-center randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of SPN-820 in adults with treatment-resistant depression. The study examined the efficacy and safety of SPN-820 over a course of four weeks of treatment and then a week of blinded placebo-washout in approximately 250 patients from approximately 40 clinical sites. The primary outcome measure was the change from baseline to end of treatment period on the MADRS Total Score.
SPN-443 – Novel stimulant for the treatment of ADHD/CNS
We completed a Phase 1 single dose study in healthy adults in 2024 following submission of an Investigational New Drug Application. The study was a first in human, pilot pharmacokinetic study of two oral formulations of SPN-443 in healthy adults. The primary objective of the study was to assess the safety and tolerability. This molecule, along with its major metabolites, is an inhibitor of norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin, also known as a triple reuptake inhibitor.

Both formulations of SPN-443 showed adequate bioavailability and were well tolerated.
Sales and Marketing
We market our key products through our own sales forces in the U.S. and seek strategic collaborations with other pharmaceutical companies to commercialize our products outside of the U.S. We have a commercial sales and marketing organization in the U.S. to support sales of our commercial products. We believe our current sales forces in the U.S. are effectively targeting healthcare providers to support and grow our key commercial products.
One sales force focuses on serving movement disorder specialists and other specialized health care providers in the U.S. in the Parkinson's area. 
The second sales force focuses on serving psychiatrists, pediatricians, primary care physicians and other health professionals in the ADHD area. 
Customers
The majority of our product sales are to pharmaceutical wholesalers, specialty pharmacies, and distributors who, in turn, sell our products to pharmacies, hospitals, and other customers, including federal and state entities. The majority of sales of Qelbree, Oxtellar XR, Trokendi XR, and XADAGO are made to wholesalers and distributors. In addition, MYOBLOC is available for direct purchase by physicians and hospitals. The majority of sales of GOCOVRI and APOKYN, are made to specialty pharmacies. 
Each of our three major customers, Cencora, Inc., Cardinal Health, Inc., and McKesson Corporation, individually accounted for more than 20% of our total product revenue in 2024 and collectively accounted for more than 77% of our total product revenue in 2024.

research organizations are commercializing or pursuing the development of products for the same molecule, compound, or diseases that we are currently pursuing or may target in the future.
ADHD
ADHD is a CNS disorder characterized by developmentally inappropriate levels of inattention, hyperactivity, and impul
sivity. ADHD affects an estimated 6% to 9% of all school-age children, and an estimated 3% to 5% of adults in the U.S. An estimated 50% of children with ADHD continue to meet the criteria for ADHD into adolescence. Diagnosis of ADHD requires a comprehensive clinical evaluation based on identifying patients who exhibit the core symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Although many patients may be inattentive, hyperactive, or impulsive, the level of severity and degree of functional impairment, and considerations as to what may be behind the underlying symptoms determine which patients meet the diagnosis and therefore should be treated for ADHD.
Competition in the U.S. ADHD market has increased with the commercial launch of several branded products in recent years, as well as the launch of generic versions of branded drugs, such as Adderall XR, Concerta, Vyvanse, Intuniv, Kapvay and Strattera. Treatment options for ADHD in the U.S. market can be broadly classified as either stimulant or as non-stimulant products. 
Our product, Qelbree, is a novel nonstimulant taken once-daily for full-day exposure. Efficacy and symptom improvement was observed early in treatment in clinical studies. Also, it has a proven safety and tolerability profile, with no evidence of abuse potential in clinical studies. Qelbree was the first novel nonstimulant treatment for ADHD approved by the FDA since 2011.
Parkinson's Disease
Parkinson's Disease is a progressive neurological disorder that is characterized by a loss of dopamine producing neurons in certain regions of the brain, causing symptoms like tremor, slowness of movement, stiffness, loss of balance, and lack of coordination. PD is the second most common progressive neurodegenerative disorder, affecting 1-2% of individuals 65 years and older. Patients with PD can also be affected with psychological symptoms such as anxiety, depression, aggression, and problems with cognition and memory. As the disease progresses, some patients may lose the ability to independently perform the tasks of daily living. 
The most commonly prescribed medicine for PD is levodopa. PD patients are frequently prescribed levodopa to help replace dopamine, which is reduced in the brain. However, motor disabilities as a result of levodopa wearing off remain a significant problem for over half of PD patients. Patients in an "OFF" state, including those whose last dose of oral levodopa has worn off and whose next oral dose has not yet begun to take effect, can suffer from reduced coordination or mobility for several hours per day. Carbidopa may be used along with levodopa to improve its efficacy and reduce the amount of levodopa needed to control PD symptoms. There are a number of alternative adjunctive treatment options (FDA-approved and in clinical development) for Parkinson's patients, including various levodopa preparations, dopamine agonists, MAO-B inhibitors, and others. 
APOKYN is given as needed as an adjunct to levodopa/carbidopa therapy in PD patients who experience "OFF" episodes. In well-controlled clinical studies, APOKYN injections were effective in treating "OFF" periods, as measured by the motor function subset of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). APOKYN, delivered via an injection pen, is for patients for whom oral levodopa will not sufficiently control "OFF" periods. Patients taking APOKYN saw 95% of "OFF" episodes reversed, with improvement beginning as quickly as 10 minutes post-dosing in clinical studies. With the alternative of immobility and limited function, we believe the rapid and reliable reduction of "OFF" episode symptoms is of utmost importance to patients. APOKYN competes with pro re nata therapies such as Inbrija, and other adjunctive therapies, including NOURIANZ. APOKYN also competes with other products for the treatment of PD, both branded such as VYALEV, and generic, including levodopa products.
For patients who experience significant "OFF" time each day, the Company has developed ONAPGO, formerly known as SPN-830, the first and only subcutaneous apomorphine infusion device for the treatment of motor fluctuations in adults with advanced PD. The infusion may reduce the variability in motor symptoms of PD and offer improved tolerability versus the acute injection route. The FDA approved ONAPGO in February 2025, and the Company will launch ONAPGO in the second quarter of 2025. ONAPGO competes with VYALEV, and with other products for the treatment of PD, both branded and generic, including levodopa products.
For patients not ready to try parenteral therapy, oral MAO-B inhibitors, such as XADAGO, may provide a decrease in "OFF" time of up to one hour per day when combined with appropriate levodopa therapy. In the XADAGO clinical trials, patients 
10
Table of Contents
experienced more beneficial "on" time, a time when Parkinson's symptoms are reduced, without troublesome uncontrolled involuntary movement (dyskinesia), compared to those receiving a placebo. The increase in "on" time was accompanied by a reduction in "OFF" time and better scores on a measure of motor function assessed during "on" time than before treatment. XADAGO competes with other MAO-B inhibitors used to treat "OFF" episodes in PD, including rasagiline (AZILECT) and selegiline (Zelapar and EMSAM). XADAGO also competes with other products for the treatment of PD, both branded and generic, including levodopa products. 
GOCOVRI (amantadine) extended-release capsules is the first and only FDA-approved medicine indicated for the treatment of dyskinesia in patients with PD receiving levodopa-based therapy, with or without concomitant dopaminergic medications, and as an adjunctive treatment to levodopa/carbidopa in patients with PD experiencing "OFF" episodes. It is also the only medicine clinically proven to reduce both dyskinesia and “OFF” periods. GOCOVRI, taken once daily at bedtime, provides an initial lag and a slow rise in amantadine concentration during the night, resulting in a high concentration from the morning and throughout the waking day. Additionally, in the clinical trials, the adjunctive use of GOCOVRI did not require changes to dopaminergic therapies. 
Epilepsy 
Epilepsy is a c
omplex neurological disorder characterized by the spontaneous recurrence of unprovoked seizures, which are sudden surges of electrical activity in the brain that impair a person's mental and/or physical abilities. Adherence with drug treatment regimens is critically important to achieving effective control for patients with epilepsy. Non-adherence with anti-epileptic drug (AED) therapy is a serious issue and remains the most common cause of breakthrough seizures for patients. Not only is taking all prescribed doses critical to control breakthrough seizures, but the timing of when patients take their prescribed doses can also be crucial.
We believe extended-release products, particularly Trokendi XR and Oxtellar XR, may offer important advantages in the treatment of epilepsy. The release profiles of extended-release products can produce more consistent and steadier plasma concentrations as compared to immediate-release products, potentially resulting in fewer side effects, better tolerability, fewer emergency room visits, improved efficacy, and fewer breakthrough seizures. In addition, Trokendi XR's and Oxtellar XR's once-daily dosing is designed to improve patient adherence over the current immediate release products, which must be taken multiple times per day. We believe a once-daily dosing regimen improves adherence, making it more probable that patients take their medication and maintain sufficient levels of medication in their bloodstreams. Extended-release products may help patients improve adherence and, consequently, help patients enjoy a better quality of life.
Trokendi XR competes with all immediate-release and extended-release topiramate products, including Topamax, Qudexy XR, and other generic topiramate products. Oxtellar XR competes with all immediate-release and extended-release oxcarbazepine products, including Trileptal and other generic oxcarbazepine products. Both Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR compete with other anti-epileptic products, both branded and generic. Many medications are used to treat epilepsy, including topiramate, oxcarbazepine, acetazolamide, brivaracetam, carbamazepine, clobazam, lacosamide, phenytoin, valproic acid, lamotrigine, gabapentin, levetiracetam phenobarbital, and zonisamide. 
In addition, when considering treatment regimens for patients with epilepsy, neurologists and epileptologists take into consideration the MOA of the different AEDs that are available. By combining several different MOAs, it is sometimes possible to get significantly better seizure control. We acquired SPN-817, an antiepileptic, which we believe has an MOA different from that of other products and can therefore potentially represent a unique additional treatment alternative. 
Migraine
Migraine is a painful, complex neurological disorder consisting of recurring painful attacks that can significantly disrupt time with loved ones, education, and careers. Migraine headaches are often characterized by throbbing pain, extreme sensitivity to light or sound, and potentially, nausea and vomiting. The World Health Organization categorizes migraine as one of the most disabling medical illnesses worldwide. The American Research Foundation categorizes migraine as the third most prevalent illness in the world, and nearly 1 in 4 U.S. households includes someone with migraines. Migraine is estimated to affect over 39 million individuals in the U.S.
As in epilepsy, we believe extended-release products, particularly Trokendi XR, may offer important advantages for the treatment of migraines. Trokendi XR also competes with other products used for the prevention of migraine headaches. Most notably, this includes anti-CGRPs (calcitonin gene related peptide), which is a class of products first introduced in 2018; Botox; beta-blockers; valproic acid; and amitriptyline.

Cervical Dystonia
11
Table of Contents
Cervical dystonia, also known as spasmodic torticollis, is a condition characterized by involuntary muscle contractions in the neck, which cause the head to twist uncontrollably into an abnormal, often painful position. It is a rare disorder, most often presenting in middle age, whose symptoms begin gradually, worsen, and then plateau over a period of months. Estimates of the prevalence of cervical dystonia vary considerably, from 20 to 4,100 per million individuals. Injections of botulinum toxin into affected neck muscles can create temporary relief from symptoms. 
In well-controlled studies, botulinum toxins like MYOBLOC have been shown to improve symptoms as measured on the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale, including pain. Based on clinical studies, MYOBLOC injections offer patients struggling with painful cervical dystonia symptoms relief as early as two weeks after injection, with the duration of effect between 12-16 weeks. 
MYOBLOC is the only available botulinum toxin B, whereas other available toxins are type A. MYOBLOC competes with type A toxins such as Botox, Dysport, and Xeomin. MYOBLOC also competes with oral agents used to treat cervical dystonia, including generic baclofen, anticholinergics, benzodiazepines, and tetrabenazine.
Sialorrhea
Sialorrhea can occur in conjunction with several neurologic disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), cerebral palsy (CP), PD, or as a side effect of some medications. It is characterized by overactive salivary glands. In adults, PD is the most common cause of sialorrhea, with 70%–80% of PD patients experiencing symptoms. In 30%–80% of schizophrenic patients taking clozapine, sialorrhea is evident. In addition to being embarrassing, complications of sialorrhea include aspiration, infection, skin breakdown, and bad odor. 
MYOBLOC competes with Xeomin (incobotulinumtoxinA) for the treatment of sialorrhea in adults. Other pharmacologic treatments used to treat sialorrhea include generic glycopyrrolate tablets as well as behavior modification. 
Manufacturing
We currently depend on third-party commercial manufacturing organizations (CMOs) for all manufa
cturing operations, including the production of raw materials, dosage form product, and product packaging. This encompasses products for commercial use, as well as some products for preclinical and clinical research. We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of any of our product candidates beyond that used in Phase 2 clinical trials, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future to support Phase 3 clinical trials or commercial production. We currently employ internal resources to manage our manufacturing contractors. 
We have agreements with CMOs headquartered in North America, including: Patheon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a subsidiary of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.), Packaging Coordinators, Inc., Aphena Pharma Solutions, and Catalent Pharma Solutions, Europe, and Asia for the manufacturing and packaging of some of our commercial products, including those of our subsidiaries, as well as for our pipeline product candidates. For Qelbree, Trokendi XR, GOCOVRI, and Oxtellar XR we currently rely on third-party CMOs for the manufacturing and packaging of final commercial products. We rely on third-party CMOs in Asia for the manufacturing of bulk drug substance for Trokendi XR and Oxtellar XR and rely on a third-party CMO in Europe for the raw materials and manufacturing of Qelbree and GOCOVRI. With respect to GOCOVRI and Qelbree, we have an additional manufacturer of bulk drug substance. These CMOs offer a comprehensive range of contract manufacturing and packaging services.

Our Proprietary Technology Platforms
We have a successful track record of developing and launching novel products by applying proprietary formulation technologies to known drugs to improve their side effect profile or improve patient adherence. In addition, we have developed new indications for existing therapies. Our key proprietary technology platforms include: Microtrol, Solutrol, and EnSoTrol. These technologies have been utilized to create novel, customized product profiles designed to enhance efficacy, reduce the frequency of dosing to improve patient adherence and improve tolerability. Our technologies have been used to create ten commercial products, including our products: Qelbree, Trokendi XR and Oxtellar XR; Adderall XR (developed for Shire, which has been acquired by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company); Intuniv (developed for Shire); Mydayis (developed for Shire); Orenitram (developed for United Therapeutics Corporation); and Namzaric (developed for Allergan plc).
We are also engaged in generating and assessing New Chemical Entities (NCEs). These NCEs are generated by leveraging our expertise in structure function relationships in active molecules. Our NCEs are being assessed in preclinical pharmacology models for CNS activity and are advancing towards Investigational New Drug application (IND) enabling toxicology studies to support potential future clinical investigation.
Intellectual Property and Exclusivity
Overview
We, including our subsidiaries, continue to build our intellectual property portfolio to provide protection for our technologies, products, and pr
oduct candidates. We, including our subsidiaries, seek patent protection, where appropriate, both in the U.S. and internationally for products and product candidates.
Our policy is to protect our innovations and proprietary products, and that of our subsidiaries, by, among other things, filing patent applications in the U.S. and abroad, including Europe, Canada, and other countries when appropriate. We, including our subsidiaries, also rely on trade secrets, know-how, proprietary knowledge, continuing technological innovation, and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. Neither we, nor our subsidiaries can be sure that patents will be granted with respect to our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us, or any of our subsidiaries in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us, or any of our subsidiaries in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology, our products, or those of our subsidiaries. Neither we, nor any of our subsidiaries can be sure that any patents, if granted, will sustain a legal challenge.
Patent Portfolio
Our commercial products, including those of our subsidiaries, covered by active patents include Trokendi XR, Oxtellar XR, Qelbree, GOCOVRI, Osmolex ER and XADAGO.

NV-5138 has multiple patents issued covering composition of matter, various methods of use, etc. in the U.S. and certain other foreign countries. The issued patents have expiration dates of 2036-2038 or beyond. There are additional pending patent applications in the U.S. and certain foreign countries.  
Other Intellectual Property Rights
We, including our subsidiaries, seek trademark protection in the U.S. and internationally, where available and when appropriate. We, including our subsidiaries, have filed for trademark protection for several marks, which are used in connection with our pharmaceutical research and development collaborations as well as with our products and those of our subsidiaries. We or our subsidiaries
 are the owner/licensee of various U.S. federal trademark registrations (®) and registration applications (TM), including the following marks referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, pursuant to applicable U.S. intellectual property laws: "Supernus

From time to time, we, including our subsidiaries, may find it necessary or prudent to obtain licenses from third party IP holders. Where licenses are readily available at a reasonable cost, such licenses are considered a normal cost of doing business. In other instances, however, we or our subsidiaries may use the results of freedom-to-operate inquiries and internal analyses to guide 
14
Table of Contents
our early-stage research away from areas where we are likely to encounter obstacles in the form of third party IP. For example, where a third party holds relevant IP and is a direct competitor, a license might not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. We, and our subsidiaries, strive to identify potential third party IP issues in the early stages of our research programs in order to minimize the cost and disruption of resolving such issues.
To protect our competitive position and that of our subsidiaries, it may be necessary to enforce our patent rights through litigation aga
inst infringing third parties. See 
Part I, Item 3—Legal Proceedings
. Litigation to enforce our own patent rights or those of our subsidiaries is subject to uncertainties that cannot be quantified in advance. In the event of an adverse outcome in litigation, we or our subsidiaries could be prevented from commercializing a product or precluded from using certain aspects of our technology platforms. This could have a material adverse effect on our business or that of our subsidiaries. In addition, litigation involving our patents or those of our subsidiaries carries the risk that one or more of our patents or those of our subsidiaries will be held invalid (in whole or in part; on a claim-by-claim basis) or held unenforceable. Such an adverse court ruling could allow third parties to commercialize products or use technologies that are similar to ours and then compete directly with us, without compensation to us or our subsidiaries. In addition, third parties could allege that our products or those of our subsidiaries infringe their intellectual property rights and pursue legal action against the Company or any of its subsidiaries. See 
Part I, Item 1A—Risk Factors
 for risk factors related to intellectual property. 
U.S. Patent Application Process 
The U.S. patent system permits the filing of provisional and non-provisional patent applications. A non-provisional patent application is submitted to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and can mature into a patent once the USPTO determines that the claimed invention meets the standards for patentability. The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the U.S., a patent's term may be lengthened via a patent term adjustment (PTA), which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in granting a patent. 
A patent’s term can be shortened through a process called a "terminal disclaimer." This process can be undertaken when a patent application is considered too similar to another patent owned by the same applicant. Without this process an applicant could be barred from obtaining a new related patent because it would be deemed to be an obvious variant of an existing patent. By filing a terminal disclaimer, a new patent can be issued at the cost of the applicant acknowledging that the new patent cannot extend beyond the expiration of the original patent. A new patent issued after the filing of a terminal disclaimer cannot be asserted against others unless the owner of the new patent also owns the previously existing patent that was the subject of the terminal disclaimer. Recent legal decisions have shown that filing a terminal disclaimer can reduce any extra time added to a patent’s term due to delays in the patent approval process. Patent applicants typically avoid filing terminal disclaimers when doing so would negatively affect their interests.
In evaluating the
 patentability of a claimed invention, the filing date of a non-provisional patent application is used by the USPTO to determine what information constitutes prior art. If certain requirements are satisfied, a non-provisional patent application can claim the benefit of the filing date of a previously filed provisional patent application. In such an instance, the filing date accorded to the provisional patent application may supersede information that otherwise could preclude the patentability of an invention.
The term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension (PTE). This permits the patent term to be extended as compensation for that portion of a patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, permits a PTE of up to five years beyond the expiry date of the patent. The length of the PTE is related to the length of time the drug is under FDA review. However, the patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval. Only one patent for an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions.
In the f
uture, if any of our product candidates receive FDA or other regulatory approval, we may be able to apply for PTEs on patents covering those products. Depending upon the timing, duration, and specifics of FDA approval and the issuance of a U.S. patent, we may obtain limited patent term restoration.
Collaborations and Licensing Arrangements
We, including our subsidiaries, obtained exclusive licenses from third parties for proprietary rights to support our, and our subsidiaries', commercial products and product candidates. Under these in-licensing agreements, we or our subsidiaries may be required to pay certain amounts upon the achievem
ent of defined milestones. If these products are ultimately commercialized, 
15
Table of Contents
we or the applicable subsidiary are also obligated to pay royalties to third parties, computed as a percentage of net product sales, for each respective product under a license agreement. 
We, including our subsidiaries, also have entered into out-licensing agreements to license our intellectual property and technology or that of our subsidiaries to third parties. Under these out-license agreements, we or our subsidiaries may be entitled to receive certain amounts upon the achievement of defined milestones and royalties from third parties, generally computed as a percentage of net product sales, for each respective product under a license agreement.
APOKYN and ONAPGO (apomorphine hydrochloride) 
In January 2016, we entered into an Amended and Restated Distribution, Development, Commercialization, and Supply Agreement with Britannia that grants us certain intellectual property and product rights in relation to APOKYN, including the right to use and market APOKYN in the United States (Territory). Additionally, under the agreement, Britannia retains certain intellectual property and product rights in relation to APOKYN, including the right to use and market APOKYN in the rest of the world, excluding the United States. Under the Agreement, Britannia has an obligation to supply us with APOKYN for our marketing and sale of the product. 
Under the agreement, we are obligated to pay Britannia a royalty based upon U.S. net sales, adjusted for other product related costs for APOKYN, ONAPGO (formerly known as SPN-830), and any other commercial products jointly developed under the agreement. The parties have also agreed to a cost sharing arrangement for the development of new products beyond APOKYN. Under the agreement, we are obligated to pay more than half of the related costs associated with the development of ONAPGO (formerly known as SPN-830) or other new products that are commercialized solely by the Company in the U.S. For costs associated with new products that are commercialized both inside and outside the Territory, we are obligated to pay less than half of the related costs. 
We have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize products under the agreement. The initial 15 year term of the agreement is subject to automatic renewal periods unless canceled by either party. Either party may terminate the agreement under certain circumstances, including a material breach of the agreement by the other.
XADAGO
In February 2016, we entered into a License and Distribution Agreement and a Supply Agreement with Zambon. Under the License and Distribution Agreement, we are the exclusive distributor of XADAGO in the U.S. and we are prohibited from selling or distributing in the U.S. certain product that compete with XADAGO. Also, Zambon is eligible to receive up to $30.0 million in future payments upon the achievement of sales-based milestones, which are based upon specified annual net product sales of XADAGO in the U.S. During the term of the License and Distribution Agreement, we are also obligated to pay a royalty on net product sales of XADAGO in the U.S. In the event that XADAGO annual net sales exceed the specified U.S. annual net product sales thresholds, the royalty percent increases and could go as high as the mid-teens.
Under the Supply Agreement, we must purchase from Zambon and Zambon must provide to us all XADAGO finished products for the U.S. market.
We have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize XADAGO under the agreement. Either party may terminate the agreement under certain circumstances, including a material breach of the agreement by the other.
MYOBLOC
In May 2004, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with a third party resulting in us owning the worldwide rights to MYOBLOC in exchange for us paying a low double-digit royalty based on U.S. annual net sales of MYOBLOC. We make royalty payments to Elan Pharmaceuticals, LLC, a subsidiary of Perrigo Pharma International DAC. While we currently have no intention of seeking approval in the U.S. for cosmetic use, if MYOBLOC is so approved, a milestone payment would be due and the royalty rate will become subject to certain reductions based on cosmetic use net sales. We also have the right under the agreement to make use of, develop and offer for sale worldwide products containing Botulinum Toxin Type B. The agreement may not be terminated for convenience. 
We have a contract manufacturing agreement with Merz Pharma GmbH & Co. KGaA (Merz) for the manufacture and supply of MYOBLOC (Merz Agreement). Pursuant to the Merz Agreement, Merz is required to provide a dedicated manufacturing facility including a stand-alone building, dedicated clean room suites, dedicated manufacturing and purification equipment, and filling and packaging production lines (collectively, the manufacturing facility) to manufacture finished products. The Merz Agreement will expire in July 2027, unless the Company and Merz mutually agree to extend the term. The Merz 
16
Table of Contents
Agreement may not be terminated for convenience. Under the terms of the Merz Agreement, the Company is required to purchase a minimum quantity of finished products on an annual basis. This minimum purchase requirement represents the in-substance fixed contract consideration associated with the dedicated manufacturing facility. The Company has an annual minimum purchase quantity requirement of finished products. 
SPN-817 (huperzine A)
In September 2018, we entered into a merger agreement to acquire Biscayne Neurotherapeutics (Biscayne), a privately-held company developing a novel treatment for epilepsy (SPN-817). Through this agreement, we obtained worldwide rights, excluding certain markets in Asia where rights have been previously out-licensed, to SPN-817. SPN-817 has received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA for the treatment of Dravet Syndrome, a severe form of childhood epilepsy and Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. We may be obligated to pay up to $73 million to the prior Biscayne security holders if certain development milestones are achieved and up to an additional $95 million if certain sales milestones are achieved. In addition, we will be obligated to pay a low single digit royalty on net sales to the prior Biscayne security holders and any applicable royalties to third parties for the use of in-licensed IP. The maximum combined royalty we will pay to all parties on net product sales is approximately 12%, depending on the IP covering the commercial product and the applicable tiered sales levels.
SPN-820 (NV-5138)
In April 2020, we entered into a development agreement (the Development Agreement) with Navitor Inc. We can terminate the Development Agreement upon 30 days' notice. Under the terms of the Development Agreement, the Company and Navitor Inc. will jointly conduct a Phase 2 clinical program for NV-5138 (SPN-820) for treatment-resistant depression. We will bear all of the Phase 1 and Phase 2 development costs incurred by either party, up to a maximum of $50 million, which amount could be increased under the terms of the Development Agreement upon Navitor Inc.’s request and the Company’s consent. In 2020, we paid a one-time, nonrefundable, and non-creditable fee of $10 million for the option to acquire or license NV-5138 (SPN-820) and made a $15 million equity investment representing approximately 13% ownership in Navitor Inc. There are also certain additional payments which could be incurred by us that are contingent upon Navitor Inc. achieving defined milestones. These payments include an additional license or acquisition fee depending on whether we ultimately license or acquire NV-5138 (SPN-820), and subsequent clinical, regulatory and sales milestone payments. The total payments, exclusive of the royalty payments on net sales of NV-5138 (SPN-820) and development costs paid by us under the agreement, have the potential to reach $410 million to $475 million, which includes an aggregate upfront payment of $25 million paid in 2020 for the option to acquire or license NV-5138 (SPN-820) and the equity investment, an additional license or acquisition fee depending on whether we ultimately license or acquire NV-5138 (SPN-820), and subsequent clinical, regulatory and sales based milestone payments. We also will have the first right of refusal for any compound with a similar mechanism of action to NV-5138 (SPN-820) on mTORC1 in the central nervous system.  
In addition to entering into the Development Agreement in April 2020, as above mentioned, we acquired Series D Preferred Shares of Navitor Inc. (the Navitor Shares), an equity investment representing an approximately 13% ownership position in Navitor Inc. As part of a legal restructuring in March 2021, our Navitor Inc. Shares were exchanged for membership interests in Navitor Pharmaceutics LLC (Navitor LLC), which became the sole shareholder of Navitor Inc. 
In the second quarter of 2024, we consented to payment of additional Phase 2 development costs for NV-5138 (SPN-820) as they are incurred, but reserve the right to terminate payment of future development costs at our discretion.

Namzaric
Namzaric (memantine hydrochloride extended release and donepezil hydrochloride) capsules for the treatment of moderate to severe dementia of an Alzheimer's type is currently marketed by Allergan plc under an exclusive license agreement between Adamas Pharmaceuticals and Forest Laboratories Holdings Limited ("Forest"), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Allergan plc (collectively, "Allergan") in the United States. Adamas Pharmaceuticals receives royalties on net sales of Namzaric from May 2020. Allergan is responsible for all manufacturing related to Namzaric.
In November 2012, Allergan was granted an exclusive license, with right to sublicense, certain of Adamas Pharmaceuticals' intellectual property rights relating to human therapeutics containing memantine in the United States. In connection with these rights, Allergan markets and sells Namzaric (memantine and donepezil hydrochlorides) extended-release capsules and NAMENDA XR (memantine hydrochloride) extended-release capsules for the treatment of moderate to severe dementia related to Alzheimer's disease. 
17
Table of Contents
Adamas Pharmaceuticals is entitled to receive royalties on net sales in the United States by Allergan, its affiliates, or any of its sublicensees of controlled-release versions of memantine products covered by the terms of the license agreement. Allergan's obligation to pay royalties with respect to fixed-dose memantine-donepezil products, including Namzaric, continues until the later of (i) 15 years after the commercial launch of the first fixed-dose memantine-donepezil product by Allergan in the United States or (ii) the expiration of the Orange Book listed patents for which Allergan obtained rights from Adamas covering such product. However, Allergan's obligation to pay royalties for any product covered by the license is eliminated in any quarter where there is significant competition from generics. 
Royalties recognized from Allergan are in the low double digits to mid-teens, as a percent of net sales of Namzaric in the United States. Based on recent trends of Namzaric sales, the tiered royalty is expected to be in the low double digits through the term of the agreement. Based on the current settlement agreements with the Namzaric Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) filers to date, the earliest date on which any of these agreements grant a license to market a Namzaric ANDA filer's generic version of Namzaric is January 1, 2025 (or earlier in certain circumstances). Alternatively, the Namzaric ANDA filers with the earliest license date have the option to launch an authorized generic version of Namzaric beginning on January 1, 2026 instead of launching their own generic version of Namzaric on January 1, 2025. In January 2025, Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. received approval from the FDA and has launched a generic version of Namzaric. Adamas expects that it will not receive royalties from sale of Namzaric after the entry of the generic version of Namzaric in January 2025. 
Adamas expects that it will not receive royalties on sales of NAMENDA XR because of the entry of multiple generic versions of NAMENDA XR. 
License Agreements with Other Third Parties
The Company has granted other companies, including United Therapeutics Corporation and Takeda Pharmaceuticals Company Ltd., rights to utilize certain of its proprietary technologies in the development of certain of their products. These technologies were used by these companies to develop certain other products, including Orenitram (treprostinil) and Mydayis. We receive royalties under these arrangements based on net product sales of certain products developed using the licensed technologies. In some cases, we are also entitled to milestone payments.
With respect to Qelbree, Oxtellar XR, and Trokendi XR, we have entered into collaboration and licensing agreements with third parties to commercialize these products outside of the U.S. Under certain licensing arrangements, we are eligible to receive royalties based on net product sales as defined in the agreements and in some cases, we are also entitled to milestone payments. We currently receive royalties from third parties related to agreements for Trokendi XR and Oxtellar XR.
The Company has also entered into settlement and licensing agreements with generic companies to settle patent litigation and to grant non-exclusive licenses to market generic versions of Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR in the U.S. Under certain licensing arrangements, the Company is eligible to receive royalties based on net product sales as defined in the agreements, and the number of generic equivalent products on the market in the U.S. We currently receive royalties from third parties related to certain agreements for Trokendi XR and Oxtellar XR.
Confidential Information and Inventions Assignment Agreements
We, including our subsidiaries, require our employees, temporary employees, and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements 
upon the commencement of employment, consulting, or collaborative relationships with us or our subsidiaries. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed by or made known during the course of the relationship with us or our subsidiaries be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties, except in specific circumstances. For example, nothing in any policy or agreement prohibits (i) reporting any possible violations of applicable laws, rules, or regulations to any governmental agency or government entity or (ii) making any other disclosures that are protected under federal, state, or local laws or regulations in the United States. The agreements provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us or relating to our business and conceived of or completed by the individual during employment or assignment, as applicable, shall be our exclusive property or the exclusive property of the applicable subsidiary, in each case, to the extent permitted by applicable law.
We and our subsidiaries seek to protect our respective products, product candidates, and our technologies through a combination of patents, trade secrets, proprietary know-how, FDA exclusivity, and contractual restrictions on disclosure.
Government Regulation
U.S. Drug Development Process
18
Table of Contents
The research and development process generally begins with discovery research, which focuses on the identification of a molecule that has the desired effect against a given disease. If clinical testing is to initiate in the United States, the FDA requires submission of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trial testing may commence. The results of pre-clinical testing, along with other information, including information abo
ut product chemistry, product manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol, are submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Until the IND becomes effective following a waiting period, we may not start the clinical trials. This is typically followed by additional preclinical laboratory and animal testing, and adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use. The satisfaction of FDA approval requirements typically takes many years. The actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with FDA regulations and requirements, including acceptable laboratory practices. 
If preclinical testing of an identified compound proves successful, the compound moves into clinical development. While these are generally conducted in three sequential phases, the phases may overlap or be combined.
•
Phase 1 - Involves the first human tests of the drug, in a small number of healthy volunteers or in patients, to assess safety, tolerability, potential dosing, and if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. 
•
Phase 2 - Involves trials in a relatively small group of patients to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication(s); dosage tolerance, and optimum dosage; and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks.
•
Phase 3 - Involves tests confirming favorable results in earlier phases, in a significantly larger patient population, and to further demonstrate efficacy and safety. Phase 3 trials include both a control group that receives the standard treatment and a study group that receives the new treatment that is being tested.
Clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with applicable regulations and consistent with acceptable clinical practices, as well as protocols detailing not only the objectives of the trial, but also the parameters to be used in monitoring safety of study participants, and/or the parameters to determine effectiveness. Each protocol involving testing on patients, and subsequent protocol amendments, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. The FDA may order the temporary halt or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or to impose other sanctions if they believe that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the applicable requirements, or if continuing the trial presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board (IRB) or ethics committee for approval. The IRB/ethics committee may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB/ethics committee requirements, or they may impose other sanctions.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate. They must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) requirements. More
over, the product used in late-stage clinical trials must be manufactured under the proposed commercial process and at the same scale as will be used commercially. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate. The manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested. Stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life under various conditions and for commercially viable lengths of time.
The research and development process, from discovery through a new drug launch, requires substantial time, effort, skill, and financial resources. The research and development of any product candidate has a significant amount of inherent uncertainty. Often, substantial resources must be committed even though success is far from assured. There is no guarantee when, or if, a product candidate will receive the regulatory approval required to launch a new drug or new indication of an existing drug.
In addition to the development of new products and new formulations, research and development projects also may include Phase 4 trials, sometimes called post-marketing studies. For such projects, clinical trials are designed and conducted to collect additional data regarding, among other parameters, the benefits and risks of an approved drug. Alternatively, these trials may be conducted to assess the effectiveness of a product candidate in a new patient population.

U.S. FDA Review and Approval Processes
Drug development is an inherently uncertain process with a high risk of failure at every stage of development. After the completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA or Biological License Application (hereinafter NDA) is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing, along with a 
description of the manufacturing process, validation of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the drug, proposed labeling, and other relevant information. The NDA requests approval to market the product. Most NDAs are subject to a substantial user fee at the time of submission; rarely applications meet conditions or gain a waiver which negates the need for the user fee. A holder of an approved NDA may also be subject to annual program and/or establishment fees. These fees typically increase annually.
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing, which is based on the agency's threshold determination that the NDA is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Sponsors will be notified if the application's review will proceed. Additional information may be requested, rather than accepting an application for filing. 
Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. Review status could be either standard or priority. A priority review designation means FDA’s goal is to take action on an application within six months, compared to 10 months under standard review. The review process may be extended by the FDA for their initial review, and, if new information submitted during the review, the review period may be extended. 
The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, which is typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts. The advisory committee reviews and evaluates information and prepares a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. After the FDA evaluates the information provided in the NDA, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been timely addressed, the FDA will re-initiate review. If it is satisfied that the deficiencies have been addressed, the FDA will issue an approval letter.
During the
 review period, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with good clinical practice regulations. The FDA may rely on a recent inspection of the facility, or they may decide to inspect each facility at which the drug is manufactured to ensure compliance with cGMP regulations. The FDA may also undertake an audit of nonclinical and clinical sites. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance is satisfactory and unless the application contains the data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
A marketing approval authorizes commercial marketing of the drug, with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigating strategy (REMS) to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for health care professionals, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools. Moreover, as a condition to product approval, the FDA may require substantial post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the drug's safety or efficacy in commercial use and may impose other conditions, including distribution and labeling restrictions, which can materially affect the potential addressable market and profitability of the drug. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained, if problems are identified following initial marketing, or if post-marketing commitments are not met. Certain of the Company's commercial products have post-marketing commitments.
The approval process is lengthy and difficult. The FDA may refuse to approve the NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied. Further, data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive, or the FDA may interpret data differently than us. In addition, if a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases, dosages, or indications. This could restrict the commercial value of the product. Also, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling, as well as requiring Phase 4 testing or post approval marketing of commercial use.
New Drug Application
Our activities encompass two types of NDAs: Section 505(b)(1) NDA (Full NDA) and Section 505(b)(2) NDA.
20
Table of Contents
A Section 505(b)(1), which is a "full" or "stand-alone" NDA, must contain all pertinent information and full reports of investigations conducted by the applicant to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the drug, as well as complete preclinical, clinical, and manufacturing information.
Section 505(b)(2) NDAs often provide an alternative path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. For a Section 505(b)(2) application, the FDA permits the submission of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from clinical trials not conducted by or for the applicant, and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The FDA permits the applicant to rely upon the FDA's previous findings of safety and effectiveness for an approved product. The FDA requires submission of information needed to support any changes to a previously approved drug, such as published data or new studies conducted by the applicant, including bioavailability or bioequivalence studies or clinical trials demonstrating safety and effectiveness. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. The Section 505(b)(2) regulatory approval process is designed to allow for potentially expedited, lower cost and lower risk regulatory approval, based on previously established safety, efficacy, and manufacturing information on a drug which has been already approved by the FDA for the same or a different indication.
To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted on previously approved drug product, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant must submit patent certifications with respect to any patents for the approved product on which the application relies that are listed in the FDA's publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly referred to as the Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify for each listed patent that either: (1) the required patent information has not been filed; or (2) the listed patent has expired; or (3) the listed patent has not expired but will expire on a particular date, and approval is not sought until after patent expiration; or (4) the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the proposed new product. A certification that the new product will not infringe the previously approved product's listed patent or that such patent is invalid or unenforceable is known as a Paragraph IV certification.
If the applicant does not challenge one or more listed patents through a Paragraph IV certification, the FDA will not approve the Section 505(b)(2) NDA application until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. Further, the FDA also will not approve, as applicable, a Section 505(b)(2) NDA application until any non-patent exclusivity has expired, for example: five-year exclusivity period for obtaining approval of an NCE; or three year exclusivity period for an approval based on new clinical trials; or pediatric exclusivity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product.
A section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant must send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the owner of the referenced NDA for the previously approved product and relevant patent holders within 20 days after the Section 505(b)(2) NDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. If the relevant patent holder elects to initiate litigation, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant may invest a significant amount of time and expense in the development of its product, only to be subject to significant delay and patent litigation before its product may be commercialized. Alternatively, if the NDA applicant or relevant patent holder does not file a patent infringement lawsuit within the specified 45 day period, the FDA may approve the Section 505(b)(2) application at any time.
Notwithstanding the approval of many products by the FDA pursuant to Section 505(b)(2) over the last few years, some pharmace
utical companies and others have objected to the FDA's interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). If the FDA changes its interpretation of Section 505(b)(2), or if the FDA's interpretation is successfully challenged in court, this could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any Section 505(b)(2) NDA that we submit.
By its very nature, a Section 505(b)(1) NDA submission carries a higher degree of regulatory approval risk than a Section 505(b)(2) NDA submission. In addition, a requirement for more extensive testing and development can adversely impact our ability to compete with alternative products that arrive on the market sooner than our product candidate. Further, the time and financial resources required to obtain FDA approval could substantially and materially increase. 
Review and Approval of Combination Products
Products comprised of separate components (e.g., a drug and a device; a biologic and a device; a drug and a biologic; or a drug, device, and a biologic) are known as "combination products." Such products often raise regulatory, policy, and review management challenges because they integrate components that are regulated under different types of regulatory requirements and by different FDA Centers, namely, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) (each a "Center"). Differences in regulatory pathways for each component can impact the regulatory processes for all aspects of product development and management, including preclinical testing, clin
ical investigation, marketing applications, manufacturing and quality control, adverse event reporting, promotion and advertising, user fees, and post-approval modifications.
21
Table of Contents
The FDA's Office of Combination Products (OCP) determines which Center will have primary jurisdiction (the "Lead Center") for the combination product based on the combination product's "primary mode of action" (PMOA). A mode of action is the means by which a product achieves an intended therapeutic effect or action. The PMOA is the mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action of the combination product or the mode of action expected to make the greatest contribution to the overall intended therapeutic effects of the combination product. The Lead Center has primary responsibility for the review and regulation of a combination product; however, a second Center is often involved in the review process, especially to provide input regarding the "secondary" component(s). In most instances, the Lead Center applies its usual regulatory pathway. For example, a drug-device combination product assigned to CDER will typically be reviewed under an NDA, while a drug-device combination product assigned to CDRH is typically reviewed through a 510(k), Premarket Approval Application (PMA), or de novo reclassification request.
Often it is difficult for OCP to determine with reasonable certainty the most important therapeutic action of the combination product. In those difficult cases, OCP will consider consistency with other combination products raising similar types of safety and effectiveness questions, or which Center has the most expertise to evaluate the most significant safety and effectiveness questions raised by the combination product. A sponsor may use a voluntary formal process, known as a Request for Designation, when the product classification is unclear or in dispute to obtain a binding decision as to which a product's primary mode of action as well as which center will regulate the combination product. If the sponsor objects to that decision, it may request that the agency reconsider that decision. 
Combination products are subject to application User Fees based on the type of application submitted for the product's premarket approval or clearance. For example, a combination product for which an NDA is submitted is subject to the NDA fee under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act. Likewise, a combination product for which a PMA is submitted is subject to the PMA fee under the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act.
Since a combination product incorporates two or more components with different regulatory requirements, a combination product manufacturer must comply with all cGMP and Quality System (QS) Regulation/Medical Device Good Manufacturing Practices (QSR) requirements that apply to each component. The FDA has issued a combination product cGMP regulation, along with final gu
idance, describing two approaches a combination product manufacturer may follow to demonstrate compliance. Under these two options, the manufacturer demonstrates compliance with:
•
All cGMP regulations applicable to each separate regulated component included in the combination product; or
•
Either the drug cGMPs or the QSR, as well as with specified provisions from the other of these two sets of requirements (also called the "streamlined approach”).
Pediatric Information
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2007 (PREA), NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indication(s) in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The intent of the PREA is to compel sponsors whose drugs have pediatric applicability to study those drugs in pediatric populations, rather than ignoring pediatric indications for adult indications that could be more economically desirable. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data, full waivers, or partial waivers of the data requirements. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which an Orphan Drug Designation has been granted.
Orphan Drug Designation
Orphan Drug Designation is granted by the FDA to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., but there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the U.S. for the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan Drug Designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. Orphan Drug Designation does not convey any advantage or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. However, if an orphan drug later receives approval for the indication for which it has an orphan designation, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication. Exceptions to this policy include showing clinical superiority to the product with the orphan drug exclusivity or if the license holder cannot supply sufficient quantities of the product. Orphan drug exclusivity in the U.S., which is seven years, does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition, provided the sponsor has conducted appropriate clinical trials required for approval. Among the other benefits of an Orphan Drug Designation, are tax credits for certain research expenses and waiver of the NDA application user fee for the orphan indication. However, a competitor obtaining orphan product exclusivity for a therapeutic agent 
22
Table of Contents
before we do, could block the approval of one of our products for seven years for the same indication, unless we are able to demonstrate that our product is clinically superior, or the competitor cannot supply sufficient quantities of the product.
Priority Review
Under FDA policies, a drug candidate is eligible for priority review, or review within six months from filing, for a new molecular entity (NME). In addition, a six month review period may pertain to a non-NME if the drug candidate provides a significant improvement as compared to marketed drugs in the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of disease. A fast track designated drug candidate would ordinarily meet the FDA's criteria for priority review. The FDA makes its determination of priority or standard review during the 60-day filing period post the initial NDA submission. 
Fast Track Designation
The FDA is required to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatenin
g condition and for which there is currently no effective treatment. These products must demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for the fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor's request. Once the FDA designates a drug as a fast track candidate, it is required to facilitate the development and expedite the review of that drug by providing more frequent communication and guidance to the sponsor. In addition to other benefits such as greater interaction with the FDA, the FDA may initiate a review of the sect
ions of a fast track drug's NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for the submission of the remaining information, and if the applicant pays the applicable user fees. However, the FDA's review period for filing and reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA has been submitted. Additionally, a fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA, if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
Post-Approval Regulatory Requirements
Any drugs for which we receive FDA approval are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things: record-keeping requirements; reporting of adverse events with the product; providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information; product sampling and distribution requirements; complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements; and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements.
Drugs may be promot
ed only for the approved indication and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, may require submission for further review and approval by the FDA before the change can be implemented. 
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following marketing approval. The FDA may also require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution and use of the product.
In addition, quality control, as well as the manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved drugs are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory agencies may withdraw product approval, or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, or if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. In addition, prescription drug manufacturers in the U.S. must comply with applicable p
rovisions of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, provide and receive product tracing information; maintain appropriate licenses, ensure they only work and contract with other properly licensed entities, and have procedures in place to identify and properly handle suspect and illegitimate products. 
Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration, and specifics of FDA marketing approval of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited PTE under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent term restoration of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and during the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product's approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally 50% of the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that 
23
Table of Contents
application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent and within sixty days of approval of the drug. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any paten
t term extension or restoration.
Market exclusivity provisions under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to gain the approval of an NDA for an NCE. A drug is an NCE if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) or active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the therapeutic action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. As an alternative to submission via 505(b)(2) approval, an applicant may choose to submit a full Section 505(b)(1) NDA, wherein the applicant would be required to conduct its own preclinical and adequate, well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. They may not refer to other clinical trials or data.
The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, Section 505(b)(2) NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA, if new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application. Such clinical trials may, for example, support: new indications; dosages; routes of administration; or strengths of an existing drug. Alternatively, these trials may be for a new use if the new clinical investigations conducted or sponsored by the applicant are determined by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application. This exclusivity, sometimes referred to as clinical investigation exclusivity, prevents the FDA from approving an application under Section 505(b)(2) for the same conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations before the expiration of three years from the date of approval. Such three-year exclusivity, however, would not prevent the approval of another application if the applicant submits a Section 505(b)(1) NDA and has conducted its own adequate, well-controlled clinical trials demonstrating safety and efficacy, nor would it prevent approval of a Section 505(b)(2) product that did not incorporate the exclusivity-protected changes of the approved drug product. The FDCA, FDA regulations, and other applicable regulations and policies prov
ide incentives to manufacturers to create modified, non-infringing versions of a drug to facilitate the approval of an ANDA or other application for generic substitutes.
Pediatric exclusivity is a type of non-patent marketing exclusivity granted in the U.S. If granted, pediatric exclusivity, provides an additional six months of exclusivity to be attached to any existing exclusivity (e.g., three or five year exclusivity) or to patent protection for a drug. This six month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent delay, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued "Written Request" for such a trial.
Other Regulatory Requirements
In March 2019, MDD US Operations, LLC (formerly US WorldMeds, LLC) and its subsidiary, Solstice Neurosciences, LLC (US) (collectively, the MDD Subsidiaries), which are subsidiaries of the Company, entered into a Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) with the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Under the CIA, the MDD Subsidiaries agreed to pay $17.5 million to resolve U.S. Department of Justice allegations that the MDD Subsidiaries violated the False Claims
 Act by paying kickbacks to induce the use of APOKYN and MYOBLOC (collectively, the MDD Products). The fine was paid by the MDD Subsidiaries prior to the closing of the USWM Acquisition. The False Claims Act provides that any Person who knowingly submits false claims to the government is liable for treble damages as well as additional penalties.
As a consequence of the USWM Acquisition, and under the terms of the CIA, the Company has assumed the extensive obligations of the MDD Subsidiaries concerning the ongoing maintenance of an effective compliance and disclosure program to promote compliance with the statutes, regulations and written directives of Medicare, Medicaid and all other Federal health care programs and with the statutes, regulations and written directives of the FDA. The CIA has a term of five years, with the final Reporting Period ending in April 2024, and imposes material burdens on the Company, its officers and directors to take actions designed to ensure compliance with applicable healthcare laws, including requirements to maintain specific compliance positions within the Company, to report any non-compliance with the terms of the agreement, to submit annual reports to the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and to have prepared an annual audit by an Independent Review Organization. The Company submitted its final report during the second quarter of 2024 and currently expects the review of its report for the final Reporting Period to conclude during the first half of 2025. The CIA sets forth potentially substantial stipulated monetary penalties for non-compliance with the terms of the agreement. In addition, the Company may be excluded from participation in federally funded healthcare programs for a material breach of the CIA, which would result in substantial losses to the Company.

The U.S. has enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. In the U.S., the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (as amended), is a sweeping measure intended to improve quality of care, constrain healthcare spending, and expand healthcare coverage within the U.S. This is accomplished primarily through the imposition of health insurance mandates on employers and individuals and the expansion of the Medicaid program.
In addition to FDA restrictions on the marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain business and marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include: anti-kickback; false claims; patient data privacy; civil monetary penalties statute; and security and transparency statutes and regulations.
The Federal Open Payments program requires certain manufacturers, including those that engage in the production, preparation, propagation, compounding, or conversion of drugs, devices, biological, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children's Health Insurance Program, with certain exceptions, to report annually to the federal government information related to payments and other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. We are also required to report information regarding payments and other transfers of value provided during the previous year to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists and anesthesiologist assistants, and certified nurse-midwives.
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), to which we are also subject, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or influence a person working in an official capacity. Under the FCPA, it is illegal to pay, offer to pay, or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. Historically, pharmaceutical companies have been the target of FCPA and other anti-corruption investigations and penalties.
In addition, we are subject to data privacy and security regulations by the federal government, the states, and certain foreign governments in which we conduct our business. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues which may affect our business. Numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of personal information. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions and create liability for us (including the imposition of significant penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity that negatively affects our business. In addition, healthcare providers who prescribe our products and research institutions we collaborate with are subject to privacy and security requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH). HIPAA and its implementing regulations impose certain requirements on covered entities, including certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates (including us) that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity and their subcontractors that use, disclose, access, or otherwise process individually identifiable protected health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA's privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, which are independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys' fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
In order to be eligible to have our products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs and purchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, we must comply with the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 (VHCA). The VHCA requires manufacturers to offer their covered drugs (biologics and single source and innovator multiple source drugs) for sale to certain federal agencies, including but not limited to, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), on a Federal Supply Schedule contract, at a price no higher than the statutory Federal Ceiling Price (FCP). The FCP is based on the non-federal average manufacturer price, or Non-FAMP, which we will have to calculate and report to the VA on a quarterly and annual basis. In addition, the Federal Supply Schedule contract requires compliance with applicable federal procurement laws.
25
Table of Contents
Depending on the circumstances, failure to comply with these laws can result in penalties, including significant criminal, civil, and/or administrative criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion of products from reimbursement under government programs, "qui tam" actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, imprisonment, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, reputational harm, diminished profits, and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our business.
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we are subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials, commercial sales, as well as the distribution of our product candidates, to the extent we choose to clinically evaluate or sell products outside of the U.S. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the appropriate regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The requirements, approval process and the time frame varies for each jurisdiction. As in the U.S., post-approval regulatory requirements, such as those regarding product manufacture, marketing, or distribution, would apply to any product that is approved outside the U.S. We generally market our products outside of the U.S. through licensing arrangements.
Refer to 
Part I, Item 1A—Risk Factors
, for discussion of risks associated with government regulations. 
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing, and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the third-party payor coverage and reimbursement status of any of our products and product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. Sales of any pr
oducts for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers, and other entities. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drug products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging prices and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective by such third-party payors. A third-party payor's decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly impacted the pharmaceutical industry. Federal, state, and local governments in the U.S. continue to consider legislation to limit the growth of health care costs, including the cost of prescription drugs. Future legislation could limit payments for pharmaceuticals, such as the product candidates that we are developing.
The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) includes measures intended to lower the cost of prescription drugs and related healthcare reforms, such as limits on price increases and subjecting an escalating number of drugs to annual price negotiations with Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). Specifically, the IRA authorizes and directs HHS to set drug price caps for certain high-cost Medicare Part B and Part D qualified drugs, with the initial list of drugs announced in August 2023. On August 14, 2024, CMS announced that it had selected 10 drugs covered under Medicare Part D for negotiation for initial maximum price applicability for calendar year 2026. None of the selected drugs were Supernus products. The IRA also authorizes HHS to penalize pharmaceutical manufacturers that increase the price of certain Medicare Part B and Part D drugs faster than the rate of inflation. The IRA also creates significant changes to the Medicare Part D benefit design by capping Part D beneficiaries' annual out-of-pocket spending. 
The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care 
in the United States has increased, and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical drug pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Over the past several years an increasing number of U.S. states have passed, or are in the process of passing, new regulations designed to increase pricing transparency associated with pharmaceutical manufacturers. Many states have determined 
26
Table of Contents
that it's in their interest to take legislative action in order to curb drug price increases and to decrease their annual pharmaceutical spending. This momentum is likely to continue in the years ahead. Many of the enacted state price transparency regulations fall into the following categories: advance notice of price increases; price increase reporting; periodic price reports; new drug reporting; price information disclosures to Health Care Professionals and state agencies. The potential penalties for noncompliance vary by state regulation. While certain regulations do not contain specific penalty clauses, most do and can contain penalties that can be significant per violation for noncompliance.
Environmental Matters
Our operations and those of our third-party manufacturers and suppliers are subject to national, state and local environmental laws. We have made, and intend to continue to make, expenditures and undertake efforts to comply with applicable laws. We believe the safety procedures utilized by us for the handling and disposing hazardous materials comply with the standards prescribed by applicable laws and regulations.
Human Capital
Our success begins and ends with our people. Our solid progress to date reflects the talent and hard work of all of our employees. We consider the intellectual capital of our employees to be an essential driver of our business and key to our future prospects. Attracting, developing, and retaining talented people in technical, marketing, sales, research, and other positions is crucial to executing our strategy and our ability to compete effectively. As of December 31, 2024, we employed 674 full-time employees in the U.S. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We consider relations with our employees to be good. 
Talent Acquisition, Retention and Development
Our key human capital objectives are to attract, retain and develop the highest quality talent. We employ various human resource programs in support of these objectives. Our ability to recruit and retain such talent depends on a number of factors, including compensation and benefits, talent development and career opportunities, and the work environment.
We attract and reward our employees by providing market competitive compensation and benefit packages, including incentives and recognition plans that extend to all levels in our organization.
