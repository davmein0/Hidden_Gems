PART I
This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Securities Act of 1933 that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements convey our current expectations or forecasts of future events. All statements contained in this Annual Report other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding our future financial position, business strategy, budgets, projected costs, plans, and objectives of management for future operations. The words "may," "continue," "estimate," "intend," "plan," "will," "believe," "project," "expect," "seek," "anticipate," "should," "could," "would," "potential," or the negative of those terms and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward-looking. 
These forward-looking statements include expectations regarding the potential benefits and commercialization of ONAPGO. In addition to the factors mentioned in this annual report, such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the Company's ability to sustain and increase its profitability; the Company's ability to raise sufficient capital to fully implement its corporate strategy; the implementation of the Company’s corporate strategy, including the successful identification and implementation of business development opportunities; the Company's future financial performance and projected expenditures; the Company's product research and development activities, including the timing and progress of the Company's clinical trials, and projected expenditures; the Company's ability to receive, and the timing of any receipt of, regulatory approvals to develop and commercialize the Company's product candidates; the Company's ability to protect its intellectual property and operate its business without infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others; the Company's expectations regarding federal, state and foreign regulatory requirements; the therapeutic benefits, effectiveness and safety of the Company's product candidates; the accuracy of the Company's estimates of the size and characteristics of the markets that may be addressed by its products and product candidates; the Company's ability to increase its manufacturing capabilities for its products and product candidates; the Company's projected markets and growth in markets; the early entry into the market of generic equivalents to all the Company's approved products; the Company's ability to develop successful product formulations that are accepted by patients, physicians, and payors; availability of potential funding sources; the Company's ability to meet its staffing needs; the Company's ability to comply with the Corporate Integrity Agreement and other risk factors set forth from time to time in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission made pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. All of these forward-looking statements are based on information available to us at this time, and we assume no obligation to update any of these statements. Actual results could differ from those projected in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those identified in the "Business," "Risk Factors," "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" sections, and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We urge you to review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report and those detailed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that attempt to advise you of the risks and factors that may affect our future results.
