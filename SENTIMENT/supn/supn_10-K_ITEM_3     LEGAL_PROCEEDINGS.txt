“Torrent”) alleging infringement of the Company’s Trokendi XR® Orange Book patents.  The Complaint—filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey—alleges, among other things, that Torrent infringed the Company’s Trokendi XR® patents by submitting to the FDA an Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”) seeking to market a generic version of Trokendi XR® prior to the expiration of the Company’s patents. Filing its July 28, 2021 Complaint within 45 days of receiving Torrent’s Paragraph IV certification notice entitles Supernus to an automatic stay preventing the FDA from approving Torrent’s ANDA for 30 months from the date of the Company’s receipt of the Paragraph IV Notice Letter.  On September 29, 2021, Torrent answered the Complaint and denied the substantive allegations of the Complaint, asserting affirmative defenses that include non-infringement and invalidity. Torrent also asserted Counterclaims seeking declaratory judgments of non‑infringement for the Trokendi XR® Orange Book patents. On November 3, 2021, the Company filed its reply, denying the substantive allegations of Torrent’s Counterclaims.  Following the initial Rule 16 Scheduling Conference, the Court issued a case schedule.  On December 17, 2021, the Court issued an order consolidating this lawsuit with the lawsuit against Ajanta, discussed in Section III, above.  The Court held a bench trial between July 31, 2023, and August 3, 2023. Closing arguments for the trial were held on October 4, 2023. On December 12, 2023, the Court issued an Order enjoining Torrent from launching its generic drug product through January 31, 2024, or until the Court’s trial decision issues, whichever is sooner. On January 30, 2024, the Court issued a Trial Opinion and Order, deciding in Supernus’s favor that the patent claims that Supernus asserted at trial against Torrent are both valid and infringed. The District Court entered a Final Judgment in Supernus’s favor on February 22, 2024.
On March 4, 2024, Torrent filed a Notice of Appeal of the Final Judgment with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The Federal Circuit docketed the appeal as 
Supernus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Ajanta Pharma Limited
 because the lawsuit against Torrent was previously consolidated with the lawsuit against Ajanta (
see
 Section III above). The Court has not set the date for oral argument.

On January 10, 2023, Defendants filed an Omnibus Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint seeking dismissal of each of Plaintiffs’ claims and the lawsuit in its entirety and US WorldMeds with USWM, Britannia, and the group of individual defendants each filed separate motions to dismiss.

Alleged competitors of Supernus filed a lawsuit against the Company, MDD US Enterprises, LLC, and MDD Operations, LLC (collectively "Enterprises") and others in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (the “Underlying Action”). After a dispute over coverage under certain insurance policies arose, Enterprises commenced a declaratory judgment action against Federal Insurance Company, RSUI Indemnity Company, and StarStone Specialty Insurance Company and others to recover insurance benefits. US WorldMeds Partners, LLC, RSUI and StarStone commenced similar declaratory judgment actions in connection with the Underlying Action. These related actions were recently consolidated. This case is in its early stages. Supernus awaits responsive pleadings to its Complaint. Discovery has not yet commenced in the consolidated action. An initial post consolidation court conference is scheduled for February 12, 2025.

Adamas Litigation
In November 2012, Adamas Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Adamas) granted Forest Laboratories Holdings Limited, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Allergan plc (Forest), an exclusive license to certain of Adamas's intellectual property rights relating to human therapeutics containing memantine in the United States. Under the terms of that license agreement, Forest has the right to enforce such intellectual property rights which are related to its right to market and sell Namzaric and NAMENDA XR for the treatment of moderate to severe dementia related to Alzheimer's disease. Adamas has a right to participate in, but not control, such enforcement actions by Forest.
Since 2018 multiple generic companies have launched generic versions of NAMENDA XR. A number of companies have submitted ANDAs including one or more certifications to the FDA, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(iv), requesting approval to manufacture and market generic versions of Namzaric, on which Adamas became entitled to receive royalties from Forest beginning in May 2020.

Table of Contents
Adamas and Forest have settled with all such Namzaric ANDA filers, including all first filers on all the available dosage forms of Namzaric. Subject to those agreements, the earliest date on which any of these agreements grant a license to market a Namzaric ANDA filer's generic version of Namzaric is January 1, 2025 (or earlier in certain circumstances). Alternatively, the Namzaric ANDA filers with the earliest date have the option to launch an authorized generic version of Namzaric beginning on January 1, 2026 instead of launching their own generic version of Namzaric on January 1, 2025. Adamas and Forest intend to continue to enforce the patents associated with Namzaric.
On April 1, 2019, Adamas was served with a complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (Case No. 3:18-cv-03018-JCS) against it and several Forest and Allergan entities alleging violations of federal and state false claims acts (FCA) in connection with the commercialization of NAMENDA XR and Namzaric by Allergan. The lawsuit is a qui tam complaint brought by a named individual, Zachary Silbersher, asserting rights of the Federal government and various state governments. The lawsuit was originally filed in May 2018 under seal, and Adamas became aware of the lawsuit when it was served. The complaint alleges that patents held by Allergan and Adamas covering NAMENDA XR and Namzaric were procured through fraud on the United States Patent and Trademark Office and that these patents were asserted against potential generic manufacturers of NAMENDA XR and Namzaric to prevent the generic manufacturers from entering the market, thereby wrongfully excluding generic competition resulting in artificially high prices being charged to government payors.
Adamas's patents in question were licensed exclusively to Forest. The complaint includes a claim for damages of “potentially more than $2.5 billion dollars,” treble damages and statutory penalties. To date the federal and state governments have declined to intervene in this action. This case is currently stayed pending Adamas's and Allergan's interlocutory appeal of the District Court's December 11, 2020 order denying Adamas's and Allergan's motions to dismiss the complaint. The appeal was heard by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (Case No. 21-80005). Argument was held on January 10, 2022. On August 25, 2022, the Ninth Circuit sided with the defendants by reversing the District Court’s public disclosure bar rulings and remanding the case back to the District Court to decide certain issues in the first instance. On October 11, 2022, the plaintiff filed a petition for rehearing with the Ninth Circuit, which was denied. On December 23, 2022, defendants filed renewed motions to dismiss directed to the remaining unresolved issue. On March 20, 2023, the District Court entered an order and final judgment dismissing with prejudice the FCA claim while declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state false claims act claims which were dismissed without prejudice. On April 19, 2023, the plaintiff appealed the District Court's dismissal of the Federal False Claims Act claim. On February 20, 2024, the plaintiff filed a motion for an indicative ruling and to set aside the judgment in the District Court, based on the same arguments raised in his appeal. That motion was fully briefed and the District Court determined that the motion for an indicative ruling was suitable for determination without a hearing. On May 7, 2024, the District Court denied the plaintiff’s motion for an indicative ruling. The appeal is fully briefed, and the Ninth Circuit heard oral argument on November 21, 2024. On January 29, 2025, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court’s order dismissing the litigation. The plaintiff intends to file a Petition for Panel and En Banc Rehearing and has asked the Ninth Circuit to extend his filing deadline until March 31, 2025.
On December 10, 2019, a putative class action lawsuit alleging violations of the federal securities laws was filed by Ali Zaidi against Adamas and certain of Adamas's former directors and officers in federal court in the Northern District of California (Case No. 4:19-cv-08051). This lawsuit alleges violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by Adamas and certain of Adamas's former directors and officers. On October 8, 2021, the presiding judge dismissed the litigation, and granted Plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint. On November 5, 2021, Plaintiffs filed their second amended class action complaint. On December 10, 2021, Adamas filed a motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint. Plaintiffs opposed the motion to dismiss. On January 13, 2023, the Court granted in part and denied in part Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss. All claims against Adamas have been dismissed with prejudice, but claims against one of the individual defendants, who may have certain rights to indemnification, remain. On February 27, 2023, Plaintiffs advised the Court that Plaintiffs would proceed only on the remaining claim against one of the individual defendants. The individual defendant filed an answer denying the claim on April 28, 2023. On September 21, 2023, the parties reached an agreement in principle to settle the Zaidi litigation, subject to court approval. On October 31, 2023, the Court granted the parties' stipulation staying all proceedings and vacating all existing deadlines. On April 2, 2024, the Court preliminarily approved the settlement of the case, including a $4.7 million payment from insurers, subject to further consideration at a settlement hearing to be held in September 2024. On September 27, 2024, the Court granted final approval of the class action settlement, dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice, and final judgment was entered.   
Adamas believes it has strong factual and legal defenses to all actions and intends to defend itself vigorously.
