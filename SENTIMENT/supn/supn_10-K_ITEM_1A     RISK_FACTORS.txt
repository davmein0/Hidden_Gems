Our failure to successfully develop and market our product candidates would impair our ability to grow.

Our clinical trials for our product candidates may fail to demonstrate acceptable levels of safety, efficacy, or other requirements, which could prevent or significantly delay regulatory approval.

•
Delays or failures in the completion of clinical development of our product candidates would increase our costs, delay, or limit our ability to generate revenues.

Healthcare reform measures could hinder or prevent the commercial success of our products or product candidates.
