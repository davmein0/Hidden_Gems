NAV per share is determined as of the last day in the relevant quarter and therefore may not reflect the NAV per share on the date of the high and low closing sales prices. The NAVs shown are based on outstanding shares at the end of each period.

On June 2, 2024, our board of directors declared a series of special distributions totaling $0.15 per share, distributed in three consecutive quarterly payments of $0.05 per share per quarter. The first and second special distributions were paid to stockholders on June 27, 2024 and September 13, 2024, respectively. The remaining special distribution is payable on December 13, 2024 to stockholders of record as of November 29, 2024.

The last reported price for our common stock on November 15, 2024 was $15.40 per share. As of November 15, 2024, we had 1,071 stockholders of record.
Distributions
Our distributions, if any, are determined by the board of directors. We elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. In order to be subject to tax as a RIC, we must distribute to our stockholders dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes each tax year of an amount at least equal to 90% of our net ordinary income and net short-term capital gains in excess of our net long-term capital losses, or investment company taxable income, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid. In addition, we are subject to ordinary income and capital gain distribution requirements under U.S. federal excise tax rules for each calendar year. If we do not meet the required distributions, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible federal excise tax on the undistributed amount.

On June 2, 2024, our board of directors declared a series of special distributions totaling $0.15 per share, distributed in three consecutive quarterly payments of $0.05 per share per quarter. The first and second special distributions were paid to stockholders of record as of June 13, 2024 and August 16, 2024, respectively, on June 27, 2024 and September 13, 2024, respectively. The remaining special distribution is payable on December 13, 2024 to stockholders of record as of November 29, 2024. On November 14, 2024, our board of directors declared a quarterly distribution of $0.39 per share, which is payable on December 27, 2024 to holders of record as of December 9, 2024, and a supplemental distribution of $0.04 per share, which is payable on December 13, 2024 to holders of record as of November 29, 2024.
We have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of our dividends and other distributions on behalf of our stockholders. As a result, if our board of directors authorizes, and we declare, a cash dividend or other distribution, then our stockholders who participate in our dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash distribution reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, rather than receiving the cash distribution.
