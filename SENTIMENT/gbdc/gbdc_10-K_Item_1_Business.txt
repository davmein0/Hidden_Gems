Interest payments on borrowed funds is based on our cost of funds on our outstanding indebtedness for the year ended September 30, 2024, which consisted of $1,368.1 million of indebtedness outstanding under revolving credit facilities, $1,242.5 million in notes issued through the Debt Securitizations, $500.0 million of 2024 Notes, that was redeemed on April 8, 2024, $600.0 million of 2026 Notes, $350.0 million of 2027 Notes, $450.0 million of 2028 Notes and $600.0 million of 2029 Notes. For the year ended September 30, 2024, the annualized cost of funds for our total debt outstanding, which includes all interest, accretion of discounts, and amortization of debt issuance costs on the Debt Securitizations, was 6.21%. Debt issuance costs represent fees and other direct incremental costs incurred in connection with our Debt Securitizations. These fees include a structuring and placement fee paid to Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC for its services in connection with the initial structuring of the 2018 Debt Securitization and legal fees, accounting fees, rating agency fees and all other costs associated with the 2018 Debt Securitization. In addition, the GBDC 3 2021 Issuer and the GBDC 3 2022 Issuer paid Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch, structuring and placement fees for its services in connection with the structuring of the GBDC 3 2021 Debt Securitization, and the GBDC 3 2022 Debt Securitization, respectively. The GBDC 3 2022-2 Issuer paid GreensLedge Capital Markets LLC and KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. structuring and placement fees for its services in connection with the structuring of the GBDC 3 2022-2 Debt Securitization.

Includes our overhead expenses, including payments under the Administration Agreement based on our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator, and any acquired fund fees and expenses that are not required to be disclosed separately. See “Item 1. Management Agreements - Administration Agreements”, as well as any amendments reflected in subsequent filings with the SEC. “Other expenses” also includes the ongoing administrative expenses to the trustee, collateral manager, independent accountants, legal counsel, rating agencies and independent managers in connection with developing and maintaining reports and providing required services in connection with the administration of each of the Debt Securitizations. Additionally, “Other expenses” includes the actual amount incurred for U.S. federal excise tax. “Other expenses” are based on actual amounts incurred for the year ended September 30, 2024. The administrative expenses of each of the Securitization Issuers are paid on each payment date in two parts: (1) a component that is paid in a priority to other amounts distributed by the applicable Securitization Issuer, subject to a cap equal to the sum of 0.04% per annum of the adjusted principal balance of the portfolio loans and other assets held by the applicable Securitization Issuer on the last day of the collection period relating to such payment date, plus $150,000 per annum, and (2) a component that is paid in a subordinated position relative to other amounts distributed by the applicable Securitization Issuer equal to any amounts that exceed the aforementioned administrative expense cap.
(8)
All of our expenses, including all expenses of each of the Debt Securitizations, are disclosed in the appropriate line items under “Annual Expenses (as a percentage of net assets attributable to common stock).” “Total annual expenses” as a percentage of consolidated net assets attributable to common stock are higher than the total annual expenses percentage would be for a company that is not leveraged. We borrow money to leverage our net assets and increase our total assets. The SEC requires that the “Total annual expenses” percentage be calculated as a percentage of net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness and after taking into account any incentive fees payable during the period), rather than the total assets, including assets that have been funded with borrowed monies. The reason for presenting expenses as a percentage of net assets attributable to common stockholders is that our common stockholders bear all of our fees and expenses.
Example
The following example demonstrates the projected dollar amount of total cumulative expenses that would be incurred over various periods with respect to a hypothetical investment in our common stock. This example and the expenses in the table above should not be considered a representation of our future expenses, and actual expenses (including the cost of debt, if any, and other expenses) could be greater or less than those shown.
You would pay the following expenses on a $1,000 investment

$722
The foregoing table is to assist you in understanding the various costs and expenses that an investor in our common stock will bear directly or indirectly. While the example assumes, as required by the SEC, a 5% annual return, our performance will vary and could result in a return greater or less than 5%. The incentive fee under the Investment Advisory Agreement, which, assuming a 5% annual return, would either not be payable or have an immaterial impact on the expense amounts shown above, is not included in the example. Under our Investment Advisory Agreement, no incentive fee would be payable if we have a 5% annual return. If we achieve sufficient returns on our investments, including through the realization of capital gains, to trigger an incentive fee of a material amount, our expenses, and returns to our investors, would be higher. The example assumes that all dividends and other distributions are reinvested at net asset value. Under certain circumstances, reinvestment of dividends and other distributions under our dividend reinvestment plan could occur at a price per share that differs from net asset value. See “Dividend Reinvestment Plan” for more information.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Overview
We are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company under the 1940 Act. In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a business development company and a RIC, we are also subject to certain constraints, including limitations imposed by the 1940 Act and the Code. 
Our shares are currently listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “GBDC.”
Our investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation by investing primarily in one stop (a loan that combines characteristics of traditional first lien senior secured loans and second lien or subordinated loans and that are often referred to by other middle-market lenders as unitranche loans) and other senior secured loans of U.S. middle-market companies. We also selectively invest in second lien and subordinated loans of, and warrants and minority equity securities in U.S. middle-market companies. We intend to achieve our investment objective by (1) accessing the established loan origination channels developed by Golub Capital, a leading lender to U.S. middle-market companies with over $70.0 billion in capital under management as of October 1, 2024, (2) selecting investments within our core middle-market company focus, (3) partnering with experienced private equity firms, or sponsors, in many cases with whom Golub Capital has invested alongside in the past, (4) implementing the disciplined underwriting standards of Golub Capital and (5) drawing upon the aggregate experience and resources of Golub Capital.
Our investment activities are managed by GC Advisors and supervised by our board of directors of which a majority of the members are independent of us, GC Advisors and its affiliates.
Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, we have agreed to pay GC Advisors an annual base management fee based on our average adjusted gross assets as well as an incentive fee based on our investment performance. The Investment Advisory Agreement was most recently approved by our board of directors in June 2024. Under the Administration Agreement, we are provided with certain administrative services by an administrator, or the Administrator, which is currently Golub Capital LLC. Under the Administration Agreement, we have agreed to reimburse the Administrator for our allocable portion (subject to the review and approval of our independent directors) of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement.
We seek to create a portfolio that includes primarily one stop and other senior secured loans by primarily investing approximately $10.0 million to $80.0 million of capital, on average, in the securities of U.S. middle-market companies. We also selectively invest more than $80.0 million in some of our portfolio companies and generally expect that the size of our individual investments will vary proportionately with the size of our capital base.
We generally invest in securities that have been rated below investment grade by independent rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. These securities, which are often referred to as “junk,” have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. In addition, many of our debt investments have floating interest rates that reset on a periodic basis and typically do not fully pay down principal prior to maturity, which could increase our risk of losing part or all of our investment.
As of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, our portfolio at fair value was comprised of the following:

TABLE OF CONTENTS
One stop loans include loans to technology companies undergoing strong growth due to new services, increased adoption and/or entry into new markets. We refer to loans to these companies as recurring revenue loans. Other targeted characteristics of recurring revenue businesses include strong customer revenue retention rates, a diversified customer base and backing from growth equity or venture capital firms. In some cases, the borrower’s high revenue growth is supported by a high level of discretionary spending. As part of the underwriting of such loans and consistent with industry practice, we adjust our characterization of the earnings of such borrowers for a reduction or elimination of such discretionary expenses, if appropriate. As of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, one stop loans included $1,021.3 million and $782.6 million, respectively, of recurring revenue loans at fair value. 
As of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we had debt and equity investments in 381 and 342 portfolio companies, respectively.
The following table shows the weighted average income yield and weighted average investment income yield of our earning portfolio company investments, which represented nearly 100% of our debt investments, as well as the total return based on our average net asset value, and the total return based on the change in the quoted market price of our stock and assuming distributions were reinvested in accordance with our dividend reinvestment plan, or DRIP, in each case for years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Total return based on market value assumes distributions are reinvested in accordance with the DRIP. Total return does not include sales load.
Revenues:
  We generate revenue in the form of interest and fee income on debt investments and capital gains and distributions, if any, on portfolio company investments that we originate or acquire. Our debt investments, whether in the form of senior secured, one stop, second lien or subordinated loans, typically have a term of three to seven years and bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these repayments fluctuates significantly from period to period. Our portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of securities. In some 
98
TABLE OF CONTENTS
cases, our investments provide for deferred interest payments or PIK interest. The principal amount of loans and any accrued but unpaid interest generally become due at the maturity date. 
In addition, we generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, amendment, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance, administrative agent fees and consulting fees. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans as fee income. For additional details on revenues, see “Critical Accounting Policies—Revenue Recognition.” We recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of the investment or derivative instrument, without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments and derivative instruments that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investment transactions in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Expenses:
  Our primary operating expenses include the payment of fees to GC Advisors under the Investment Advisory Agreement and interest expense on our outstanding debt. We bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including:
•
calculating our NAV (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firm);
•
fees and expenses incurred by GC Advisors payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisors, in monitoring financial and legal affairs for us and in monitoring our investments and performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies or otherwise relating to, or associated with, evaluating and making

investments
, 
which fees and expenses include, among other items, due diligence reports, appraisal reports, any studies commissioned by GC Advisors and travel and lodging expenses;
•
expenses related to unsuccessful portfolio acquisition efforts;
•
offerings of our common stock and other securities;
•
administration fees and expenses, if any, payable under the Administration Agreement (including payments based upon our allocable portion of the Administrator’s overhead in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and the allocable portion of the cost of our chief compliance officer, chief financial officer and their respective staffs);
•
fees payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisors, relating to, or associated with, evaluating and making investments in portfolio companies, including costs associated with meeting financial sponsors;
•
transfer agent, dividend agent and custodial fees and expenses;
•
U.S. federal and state registration and franchise fees;
•
all costs of registration and listing our shares on any securities exchange;
•
U.S. federal, state and local taxes;
•
independent directors’ fees and expenses;
•
costs of preparing and filing reports or other documents required by the SEC or other regulators;
•
costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to stockholders, including printing costs;
•
costs associated with individual or group stockholders;
•
costs associated with compliance under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;
•
our allocable portion of any fidelity bond, directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums;
•
direct costs and expenses of administration, including printing, mailing, long distance telephone, copying, secretarial and other staff, independent auditors and outside legal costs;
•
proxy voting expenses; and
•
all other expenses incurred by us or the Administrator in connection with administering our business.
We expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or decline as a percentage of total assets during periods of asset growth and to increase during periods of asset declines.

The 2018 Issuer paid Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC structuring and placement fees for its services in connection with the structuring of the 2018 Debt Securitization. Before we acquired the GCIC 2018 Issuer as part of our acquisition of Golub Capital Investment Corporation, a Maryland corporation, or GCIC, on September 6, 2019, the GCIC 2018 Issuer paid Wells Fargo Securities, LLC structuring and placement fees for its services in connection with the initial structuring of the GCIC 2018 Debt Securitization.

Term debt securitizations are also known as CLOs, and are a form of secured financing incurred by us, which are consolidated by us and subject to our overall asset coverage requirement. The 2018 Issuer, GCIC 2018 Issuer, GBDC 3 2021 Issuer, GBDC 3 2022 Issuer and GBDC 3 2022-2 Issuer also agreed to pay ongoing administrative expenses to the trustee, collateral manager, independent accountants, legal counsel, rating agencies and independent managers in connection with developing and

maintaining reports, and providing required services in connection with the administration of the 2018 Debt Securitization, GCIC 2018 Debt Securitization, the GBDC 3 2021 Debt Securitization, the GBDC 3 2022 Debt Securitization and the GBDC 3 2022-2 Debt Securitization and collectively the Debt Securitizations, as applicable.
We believe that these administrative expenses approximate the amount of ongoing fees and expenses that we would be required to pay in connection with a traditional secured credit facility. Our common stockholders indirectly bear all of these expenses.
GBDC 3 Acquisition
On June 3, 2024, we completed our acquisition of GBDC 3, pursuant to the GBDC 3 Merger Agreement. Pursuant to the GBDC 3 Merger Agreement, and, immediately following the Initial GBDC 3 Merger, GBDC 3 was then merged with and into us, with us as the surviving company. As a result of, and as of the effective time of, the GBDC 3 Merger, GBDC 3’s separate existence ceased. 
In accordance with the terms of the GBDC 3 Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the GBDC 3 Merger, each outstanding share of GBDC 3’s common stock was converted into the right to receive 0.9138 shares of our common stock (with GBDC 3’s stockholders receiving cash in lieu of fractional shares of our common stock). As a result of the GBDC 3 Merger, we issued an aggregate of 92,115,308 shares of our common stock to former stockholders of GBDC 3. 
Upon the consummation of the GBDC 3 Merger, we entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement, with GC Advisors, which replaced the Fourth Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement by and between the Company and the Investment Adviser dated as of July 1, 2023 (the “Prior Investment Advisory Agreement”).
Recent Developments
On November 14, 2024, our Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.39 per share, which is payable on December 27, 2024 to holders of record as of December 9, 2024, and a supplemental distribution of $0.04 per share, which is payable on December 13, 2024 to holders of record as of November 29, 2024.
On November 15, 2024, we entered into an agreement with a new lender to increase the aggregate commitments outstanding under the JPM Credit Facility to $1.9 billion from $1.8 billion as of September 30, 2024.
On November 15, 2024, we issued a notice of redemption to the holders of the GBDC 3 2022-2 Notes. The redemption is expected to occur on December 16, 2024 pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing such GBDC 3 2022-2 Notes. See Note 7 for a description of the outstanding GBDC 3 2022-2 Notes, including the interest rates and maturity date of such notes.
On November 18, 2024, GBDC completed a $2.2 billion term debt securitization, (the“2024 Debt Securitization”). In connection with the 2024 Debt Securitization closing, GBDC fully redeemed each of its (1) 2018 Debt Securitization, (2) GCIC 2018 Debt Securitization and (3) GBDC 3 2021 Debt Securitization. See Note 7 for a description of the outstanding 2018 Securitization Notes, GCIC 2018 Debt Securitization Notes and the GBDC 3 2021 Debt Securitization Notes, including the interest rates and maturity date of such notes.

Net income can vary substantially from period to period for various reasons, including the recognition of realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation. As a result, quarterly and year-to-date comparisons of operating results may not be meaningful.
On September 16, 2019, and June 3, 2024, we completed our acquisitions of GCIC and GBDC 3, respectively. Each acquisition was accounted for under the asset acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805-50, 
Business Combinations — Related Issues
. Under asset acquisition accounting, where the consideration paid to GCIC and GBDC 3’s stockholders exceeded the relative fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the premium paid by us was allocated to the cost of the GCIC and GBDC 3 investments acquired by us pro-rata based on their relative fair value. Immediately following each acquisition of GCIC and GBDC 3, we recorded its assets at their respective fair values and, as a result, the purchase premium allocated to the cost basis of the GCIC and GBDC 3 assets acquired was immediately recognized as unrealized depreciation on our Consolidated Statement of Operations. The purchase premium allocated to investments in loan securities will amortize over the life of the loans through interest income with a corresponding reversal of the unrealized depreciation on such loans acquired through their ultimate disposition. The purchase premium allocated to investments in equity securities will not amortize over the life of the equity securities through interest income and, assuming no subsequent change to the fair value of the equity securities acquired from GCIC and GBDC 3 and disposition of such equity securities at fair value, we will recognize a realized loss with a corresponding reversal of the unrealized depreciation upon disposition of the equity securities acquired.
As a supplement to our GAAP financial measures, we have provided the following non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful for the reasons described below:
•
“Adjusted Net Investment Income” - excludes the amortization of the purchase price premium from net investment income calculated in accordance with GAAP;
102
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
“Adjusted Net Investment Income Before Accrual for Capital Gain Incentive Fee” - Adjusted Net Investment Income excluding the accrual or reversal for the capital gain incentive fee under GAAP; 
•
“Adjusted Net Realized and Unrealized Gain/(Loss)” - excludes the unrealized loss resulting from the purchase premium write-down and the corresponding reversal of the unrealized loss resulting from the amortization of the premium on loans or from the sale of equity investments from the determination of realized and unrealized gain/(loss) determined in accordance with GAAP; and
•
“Adjusted Net Income” – calculates net income and earnings per share based on Adjusted Net Investment Income and Adjusted Net Realized and Unrealized Gain/(Loss).

We believe that excluding the financial impact of the purchase premium in the above non-GAAP financial measures is useful for investors as this is a non-cash expense/loss and is one method we use to measure our results of operations. In addition, we believe that providing the Adjusted Net Investment Income Before Accrual for Capital Gain Incentive Fee is a useful non-GAAP financial measure as such accrual is not contractually payable under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement. 
Although these non-GAAP financial measures are intended to enhance investors’ understanding of our business and performance, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP.
Investment Income 
Investment income increased from the year ended September 30, 2023 to the year ended September 30, 2024 by $121.6 million, primarily due to an increase in interest and PIK interest income as a result of (1) an increase in the average earning debt investments balance of $532.5 million driven by our acquisition of GBDC 3, and (2) rising interest base rates coupled with an increase in non-cash dividend income driven by an increase in the average earning preferred equity investments balance of $47.7 million.

Income yields on senior secured loans and one stop loans increased for the year ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to rising interest base rates. Our loan portfolio is partially insulated from a drop in floating interest rates, as 98.1% of the loan portfolio at fair value is subject to an interest rate floor. As of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the weighted average base rate floor of our loans was 0.81% and 0.80%, respectively.
As of September 30, 2024, we have second lien investments in four portfolio companies and subordinated debt investments in seven portfolio companies as shown in the Consolidated Schedule of Investments. Due to the limited number of second lien and subordinated debt investments, income yields on second lien and subordinated debt investments can be significantly impacted by the addition, subtraction or refinancing of one investment.

Interest Expense
Interest and other debt financing expenses, including amortization of debt issuance costs, increased from the year ended September 30, 2023 to the year ended September 30, 2024 by $61.8 million, primarily due to (i) the issuance of the 2028 Notes and 2029 Notes, (ii) rising interest base rates on borrowings from our floating rate debt facilities, and (iii) an increase in average debt outstanding of $423.2 million primarily due to the assumption of GBDC 3’s debt facilities that was partially offset by $4.6 million of net unrealized gains related to the fair value hedge of the interest rate swaps on the 2028 and 2029 Notes. For more information about our outstanding borrowings for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, including the terms thereof, see “Note 7. Borrowings” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements and the “
Liquidity and Capital Resources”
 section below. 
For the year ended September 30, 2024, the effective average interest rate, which includes amortization of debt financing costs, amortization of discounts on notes issued non-usage facility fees and the net contractual interest rate swap expense on the 2028 and 2029 Notes but excluding the net gain/(loss) related to the fair value hedges associated with the 2028 and 2029 Notes interest rate swaps, on our total debt was 6.2%. For the year ended September 30, 2023, the effective average interest rate, which includes amortization of debt financing costs, amortization of discounts on notes issued and non-usage facility fees, on our total debt was 4.9%. The effective average interest rate increased for the year ended September 30, 2024 compared to the year ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the 2028 Notes and 2029 Notes issuances, the redemption of the 2024 Notes that bore interest at a rate of 3.375% and rising interest rates on our borrowings from floating rate debt facilities.
Management Fee
The base management fee decreased from the year ended September 30, 2023 to the year ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to the base management fee rate reduction to 1.0% from 1.375% effective July 1, 2023 under the  Investment Advisory Agreement, as compared to the Prior Investment Advisory Agreement that was partially offset by increased base management fees incurred due to an increase in average adjusted gross assets from 2023 to 2024.
Incentive Fees
The incentive fee payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement consists of two parts: (1) the Income Incentive Fee and (2) the Capital Gain Incentive Fee. 
The Income Incentive Fee decreased by $24.2 million from the year ended September 30, 2023 to the year ended September 30, 2024 primarily as a result of $27.3 million in aggregate waivers of Income Incentive Fees during the year ended September 30, 2024 that offset an increase in Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income and a greater rate of return on the value of our net assets driven by net funds growth, the impact of rising interest base rates and an increase in non-cash dividend income during fiscal year 2024. For each of years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we were fully through the Income Incentive Fee “catch-up” provision. The Income Incentive Fee was equal to 15% of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, net of the GBDC 3 Merger Waiver, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 20% of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the three months ended December 31, 2023.
105
TABLE OF CONTENTS
As of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, there was no Capital Gain Incentive Fee payable as calculated under the Investment Advisory Agreement. In accordance with GAAP, we are required to include the aggregate unrealized capital appreciation on investments in the calculation and accrue a capital gain incentive fee as if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee actually payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement. As of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, there was no capital gain incentive fee accrual calculated in accordance with GAAP. Any payment due under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement is calculated in arrears at the end of each calendar year. No Capital Gain Incentive Fees as calculated under the Investment Advisory Agreement or any prior investment advisory agreements, as applicable, have been payable since December 31, 2018.

Professional Fees, Administrative Service Fee and General and Administrative Expenses
In total, professional fees, the administrative service fee and general and administrative expenses increased by $1.5 million from the year ended September 30, 2023 to the year ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to an increase in the administrative service fee and professional fees. 
The Administrator pays for certain expenses incurred by us. These expenses are subsequently reimbursed in cash. Total expenses reimbursed to the Administrator during the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were $13.0 million and $8.2 million, respectively.
As of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, included in accounts payable and other liabilities were $2.7 million and $2.0 million, respectively, of expenses paid on behalf of us by the Administrator.

During the year ended September 30, 2024, we had a net realized loss of $79.9 million, primarily attributable to realized losses recognized on (i) the restructure of equity and debt investments of multiple portfolio companies during the year ended September 30, 2024 and (ii) the disposition of equity and debt investments of a portfolio company that were partially offset by (i) realized gains recognized on the sale of equity investments in multiple portfolio companies throughout the year ended September 30, 2024 and, to a lesser extent, (ii) net realized gains recognized on the settlement of forward currency contracts and the translation of foreign currency amounts and transactions into U.S. dollars. During the year ended September 30, 2023, we had a net realized loss of $44.1 million primarily attributable to the realized loss recognized on the restructuring of debt investments of multiple portfolio companies and the disposition of equity and debt investments of multiple portfolio company investments that were 
106
TABLE OF CONTENTS
partially offset by realized gains on the sale of equity investments in multiple portfolio companies and gains on the settlement of forward currency contracts.
For the year ended September 30, 2024, we had $78.6 million in unrealized appreciation on 190 portfolio company investments, which was offset by $59.0 million in unrealized depreciation on 230 portfolio company investments. For the year ended September 30, 2023, we had $100.4 million in unrealized appreciation on 191 portfolio company investments, which was offset by $86.2 million in unrealized depreciation on 179 portfolio company investments. 
Unrealized appreciation for the year ended September 30, 2024 primarily resulted from the reversal of unrealized depreciation on the disposition or restructuring of portfolio company investments, improved performance of certain portfolio companies and the reversal of unrealized depreciation due to spread tightening in the market during the 2024 fiscal year. Unrealized appreciation for the year ended September 30, 2023 primarily resulted from the reversal of unrealized depreciation on the sale, restructuring or disposition of portfolio company investments, loan repayments and improved performance of certain portfolio companies. Unrealized depreciation for the year ended September 30, 2024 primarily resulted from isolated deterioration in the credit performance of certain portfolio companies that were moved to or on non-accrual status as well as certain portfolio companies with pre-existing credit challenges. Unrealized depreciation for the year ended September 30, 2023 primarily resulted from decreases in the fair value across our portfolio company investments due to incremental spread widening in the market during the first quarter of the 2023 fiscal year and isolated deterioration in the credit performance of a small number of portfolio companies. 
During the year ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a $51.7 million net change in unrealized depreciation on investments due to a one-time purchase premium write-down in connection to the GBDC 3 Merger. 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
For the year ended September 30, 2024, we experienced a net increase in cash and cash equivalents, foreign currencies, restricted cash and cash equivalents and restricted foreign currencies of $219.7 million. During the year, cash provided by operating activities was $343.9 million, primarily driven by proceeds from principal payments and sales of portfolio investments of $1,262.9 million and net investment income after tax of $382.4 million, offset by fundings of portfolio investments of $1,299.9 million. Lastly, cash used in financing activities was $124.2 million, primarily driven by borrowings on debt of $2,928.6 million, offset by repayments of debt of $2,690.9 million and distributions paid of $338.2 million.
For the year ended September 30, 2023, we experienced a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents, foreign currencies, restricted cash and cash equivalents and restricted foreign currencies of $40.2 million. During the year, cash provided by operating activities was $195.4 million, primarily driven by proceeds from principal payments and sales of portfolio investments of $670.2 million and net investment income after excise tax of $289.1 million, offset by fundings of portfolio investments of $675.3 million. Lastly, cash used by financing activities was $235.5 million, primarily driven by repayments of debt of $627.1 million, distributions paid of $191.5 million and purchases of common stock under the DRIP of $46.9 million, offset by borrowings on debt of $652.6 million.
As of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $123.1 million and $65.6 million, respectively. In addition, we had foreign currencies of $8.0 million and $4.2 million as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, restricted cash and cash equivalents of $227.2 million and $70.4 million as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, and restricted foreign currencies of $1.2 million as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2023, we had no restricted foreign currencies. Cash and cash equivalents and foreign currencies are available to fund new investments, pay operating expenses and pay distributions. Restricted cash and cash equivalents and restricted foreign currencies can be used to pay principal and interest on borrowings and to fund new investments that meet the guidelines under our debt securitizations or credit facilities, as applicable. As of September 30, 2024, $136.3 million of restricted cash was retained for partial repayments on the notes of certain of our debt securitizations that are past their reinvestment period term.

As of September 30, 2024, we had debt outstanding under the GBDC 3 2022 Debt Securitization of $236.8 million.
GBDC 3 2022-2 Debt Securitization - 
Effective June 3, 2024, we assumed as a result of the GBDC 3 Merger, the GBDC 3 2022-2 Debt Securitization. The Class A 2022-2 Notes and Class A GBDC 3 2022-2 Loan are included in the September 30, 2024 Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as our debt and Subordinated GBDC 3 2022-2 Notes were eliminated in consolidation. As of September 30, 2024, we had debt outstanding under the GBDC 3 2022-2 Debt Securitization of $225.0 million.
Due to the interplay of the 1940 Act restrictions on principal and joint transactions and the U.S. risk retention rules adopted pursuant to Section 941 of Dodd-Frank, as a business development company, we sought and received no action relief from the SEC to ensure we could engage in CLO financings in which assets are transferred through GC Advisors.

2026 Notes
On February 24, 2021, we issued $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes. On October 13, 2021, we issued an additional $200.0 million in aggregate principal of the 2026 Notes. As of both September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we had $600.0 million of outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes.
2027 Notes
On July 27, 2021, we issued $350.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Notes, all of which remained outstanding as our debt as of both September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.
2028 Notes
On December 5, 2023, we issued $450.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Notes, all of which remained outstanding as our debt as of September 30, 2024.
On December 5, 2023, we entered into an interest rate swap on the 2028 Notes pursuant to which we agreed to receive a fixed rate of 7.310% and pay a rate of one-month Term SOFR plus 3.327%. The interest rate swap is designated as an effective hedge accounting instrument. The notional amount of the swap is $225.0 million and terminates on November 5, 2028. The carrying value of the 2028 Notes is inclusive of an adjustment for the change in fair value 
of an effective hedge accounting relationship.
On April 11, 2024, we entered into an interest rate swap on the remaining portion of the 2028 Notes pursuant to which we agreed to receive a fixed rate of 7.310% and pay a rate of one-month SOFR plus 2.835%. The interest rate swap is designated as an effective hedge accounting instrument. The notional amount of the swap is $225.0 million and terminates on November 5, 2028.
2029 Notes
On February 1, 2024, we issued $600.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes, all of which remained outstanding as our debt as of September 30, 2024.
On February 1, 2024, we entered into an interest rate swap on the 2029 Notes pursuant to which we agreed to receive a fixed rate of 6.248% and pay a rate of one-month Term SOFR plus 2.444%. The interest rate swap is designated as an effective hedge accounting instrument. The notional amount of the swap is $600.0 million and terminates on July 15, 2029. 
Equity Distribution Agreement
On October 6, 2023, we entered into an equity distribution agreement, or the 2023 Equity Distribution Agreement, in connection with an at the market program to sell up to $250.0 million of shares of our common stock. An at the market offering is a registered offering by a publicly traded issuer of its listed equity securities that allows the issuer to sell shares directly into the market at market prices. During the three months ended December 31, 2023, we terminated the equity distribution agreement entered into on May 28, 2021, or the 2021 Equity Distribution Agreement. As of both September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, there have been no common stock issuances under either the 2021 or 2023 Equity Distribution Agreements. 
Asset Coverage, Contractual Obligations, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Liquidity Considerations 
As of September 30, 2024, in accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we were allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least 150% after such borrowing. Prior to February 6, 2019, in accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we were allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, was at least 200% after such borrowing. We currently intend to continue to target a GAAP debt-to-equity ratio between 0.85x to 1.25x. As of September 30, 2024, our asset coverage for borrowed amounts and GAAP debt-to-equity ratio was 186.0% and 1.16x, respectively, 
109
TABLE OF CONTENTS
and our GAAP debt-to-equity ratio, net, which reduces total debt by cash and cash equivalents and foreign currencies, was 1.12x as of September 30, 2024.
On August 2, 2024, our board of directors reapproved the Program (as defined in Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements), which allows us to repurchase up to $150 million of our outstanding common stock, exclusive of shares repurchased prior to the date of such authorization, on the open market at prices below the NAV per share as reported in our then most recently published consolidated financial statements. The Program is implemented at the discretion of management with shares to be purchased from time to time at prevailing market prices, through open market transactions, including block transactions, pursuant to Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. During the year ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 331,928 shares of our common stock for an aggregate repurchase price of approximately $4.8 million. During the year ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased 1,300,928 shares of our common stock for an aggregate repurchase price of approximately $16.9 million.
As of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we had outstanding commitments to fund investments totaling $717.9 million and $189.4 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, total commitments of $717.9 million included $157.6 million of unfunded commitments on revolvers. There is no guarantee that these amounts will be funded to the borrowing party now or in the future. The unfunded commitments relate to loans with various maturity dates, but the entire amount was eligible for funding to the borrowers, subject to the terms of each loan’s respective credit agreement. A summary of maturity requirements for our principal borrowings as of September 30, 2024 is included in Note 7 of our consolidated financial statements. We did not have any other material contractual payment obligations as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we believe that we had sufficient assets and liquidity to adequately cover future obligations under our unfunded commitments based on historical rates of drawings upon unfunded commitments, cash and restricted cash balances that we maintain, availability under the Adviser Revolver, GBDC 3 DB Credit Facility and JPM Credit Facility, as well as ongoing principal repayments on debt investments. In addition, we generally hold some syndicated loans in larger portfolio companies that are saleable over a relatively short period to generate cash.
In addition, we have entered and, in the future, could again enter into derivative instruments that contain elements of off-balance sheet market and credit risk. Refer to Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for outstanding forward currency contracts and interest rate swap agreements as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. Derivative instruments can be affected by market conditions, such as interest rate volatility, which could impact the fair value of the derivative instruments. If market conditions move against us, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the derivative instruments and could realize a loss. We minimize market risk through monitoring its investments and borrowings.
Although we expect to fund the growth of our investment portfolio through the net proceeds from future securities offerings and future borrowings, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, we cannot assure you that our efforts to raise capital will be successful. In addition, from time to time, we can amend or refinance our leverage facilities and securitization financings, to the extent permitted by applicable law. In addition to capital not being available, it also could not be available on favorable terms. To the extent we are not able to raise capital on what we believe are favorable terms, we will focus on optimizing returns by investing capital generated from repayments into new investments we believe are attractive from a risk/reward perspective. Furthermore, to the extent we are not able to raise capital and are at or near our targeted leverage ratios, we expect to receive smaller allocations, if any, on new investment opportunities under GC Advisors’ allocation policy and have, in the past, received such smaller allocations under similar circumstances.

We refer to a loan as non-accrual when we cease recognizing interest income on the loan because we have stopped pursuing repayment of the loan or, in certain circumstances, it is past due 90 days or more on principal and interest or our management has reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected. See “— Critical Accounting Policies — Revenue Recognition.”

 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for our portfolio companies was $63.7 million and $58.8 million, respectively. The portfolio median EBITDA is based on the most recently reported trailing twelve-month EBITDA received from the portfolio company.
As part of the monitoring process, GC Advisors regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our investments and rates each of them based on an internal system developed by Golub Capital and its affiliates. This system is not generally accepted in our industry or used by our competitors. It is based on the following categories, which we refer to as GC Advisors’ internal performance ratings:

Internal Performance Ratings
Rating

Definition
5

Involves the least amount of risk in our portfolio. The borrower is performing above expectations, and the trends and risk factors are generally favorable.
4

Involves an acceptable level of risk that is similar to the risk at the time of origination. The borrower is generally performing as expected, and the risk factors are neutral to favorable.
3

Involves a borrower performing below expectations and indicates that the loan’s risk has increased somewhat since origination. The borrower could be out of compliance with debt covenants; however, loan payments are generally not past due.
2

Involves a borrower performing materially below expectations and indicates that the loan’s risk has increased materially since origination. In addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments could be past due (but generally not more than 180 days past due).
1

Involves a borrower performing substantially below expectations and indicates that the loan’s risk has substantially increased since origination. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. Loans rated 1 are not anticipated to be repaid in full and we will reduce the fair market value of the loan to the amount we anticipate will be recovered.
Our internal performance ratings do not constitute any rating of investments by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or represent or reflect any third-party assessment of any of our investments. 
For any investment rated 1, 2 or 3, GC Advisors will increase its monitoring intensity and prepare regular updates for the investment committee, summarizing current operating results and material impending events and suggesting recommended actions.
GC Advisors monitors and, when appropriate, changes the internal performance ratings assigned to each investment in our portfolio. In connection with our valuation process, GC Advisors and our board of directors review these internal performance ratings on a quarterly basis.

 The portfolio median EBITDA is based on our portfolio of debt investments and excludes (i) portfolio companies with negative or de minimis EBITDA, (ii) investments designated as recurring revenue loans and (iii) portfolio companies with any loans on non-accrual status.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Distributions
We intend to make quarterly distributions to our stockholders as determined by our board of directors. For additional details on distributions, see “Income taxes” in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.
We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of our distributions from time to time. In addition, the asset coverage requirements applicable to us as a business development company under the 1940 Act could limit our ability to make distributions. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences, including the possible loss of our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions.
Because federal income tax regulations differ from GAAP, distributions in accordance with tax regulations can differ from net investment income and realized gains recognized for financial reporting purposes. Differences are permanent or temporary. Permanent differences are reclassified within capital accounts in the financial statements to reflect their tax character. For example, permanent differences in classification result from the treatment of distributions paid from short-term gains as ordinary income dividends for tax purposes. Temporary differences arise when certain items of income, expense, gain or loss are recognized at some time in the future. 
To the extent our taxable earnings fall below the total amount of our distributions for any tax year, a portion of those distributions could be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, the source of a distribution to our stockholders could be the original capital invested by the stockholder rather than our income or gains. Stockholders should read any written disclosure accompanying a distribution payment carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our ordinary income or gains.
We have adopted an “opt out” dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a distribution, our stockholders’ cash distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock unless a stockholder specifically “opts out” of our dividend reinvestment plan. If a stockholder opts out, that stockholder will receive cash distributions. Although distributions paid in the form of additional shares of our common stock will generally be subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes in the same manner as cash distributions, stockholders participating in our dividend reinvestment plan will not receive any corresponding cash distributions with which to pay any such applicable taxes.

Related Party Transactions
We have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following:
•
We entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with GC Advisors. Mr. Lawrence Golub, our chairman, is a manager of GC Advisors, and Mr. David Golub, our chief executive officer, is a manager of GC Advisors, and each of Messrs. Lawrence Golub and David Golub owns an indirect pecuniary interest in GC Advisors. The Board most recently approved an amended and restated Investment Advisory Agreement on June 3, 2024. The Investment Advisory Agreement amended the Prior Investment Advisory Agreement in order to incorporate changes to the calculation of the incentive fee rates and the incentive fee cap. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the incentive fee rates were reduced from 20.0% to 15.0%, and the incentive fee cap was reduced from 20.0% to 15.0%. None of the other material terms changed in the Investment Advisory Agreement as compared to the Prior Investment Advisory Agreement, including the services to be provided and the calculation of the base management fee. On August 3, 2023, effective July 1, 2023 the Board approved an amended and restated Investment Advisory Agreement, pursuant to which the base management fee rate was reduced from 1.375% to 1.0%.
•
GC Advisors agreed to irrevocably waive any incentive fees in excess of 15% and waive incentive fees in excess of an incentive fee cap that is also reduced to 15%, in each case effective as of January 1, 2024 for periods ending on or prior to the earlier of (i) the closing of the acquisition of GBDC 3 pursuant to the GBDC 3 Merger Agreement or (ii) the termination of the GBDC 3 Merger Agreement (the “Waiver Period”), in accordance with the terms of a waiver letter agreement (the “ GBDC 3 Merger Waiver”) to the Investment Advisory Agreement. During the Waiver Period, as a result of the  GBDC 3 Merger Waiver, fees payable to the Investment Adviser under the Investment Advisory Agreement, net of the GBDC 3 Merger Waiver, will equal those that would be payable under the investment advisory agreement that would be entered into and effective upon closing of the GBDC 3 Merger Agreement. 
•
Golub Capital LLC provides, and other affiliates of Golub Capital have historically provided, us with the office facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct day-to-day operations pursuant to our Administration Agreement.
•
We have entered into a license agreement with Golub Capital LLC, pursuant to which Golub Capital LLC has granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name “Golub Capital.”
•
Under the Staffing Agreement, Golub Capital LLC has agreed to provide GC Advisors with the resources necessary to fulfill its obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement. The Staffing Agreement provides that Golub Capital LLC will make available to GC Advisors experienced investment professionals and provide access to the senior investment personnel of Golub Capital LLC for purposes of evaluating, negotiating, structuring, closing and monitoring our investments. The Staffing Agreement also includes a commitment that the members of GC Advisors’ investment committee will serve in such capacity. Services under the Staffing Agreement are provided on a direct cost reimbursement basis. We are not a party to the Staffing Agreement.
•
GC Advisors serves as collateral manager to the 2018 Issuer, the GCIC 2018 Issuer, the GBDC 3 2021 Issuer, the GBDC 3 2022 Issuer and the GBDC 3 2022-2 Issuer under the 2018 Collateral Management Agreement, the GCIC 2018 Collateral Management Agreement the 2021 Collateral Management Agreement, the 2022 Collateral Management Agreement and the 2022-2 Collateral Management Agreement, respectively. Fees payable to GC Advisors for providing these services offset against the base management fee payable by us under the Investment Advisory Agreement.
•
We have entered into the Adviser Revolver with GC Advisors in order to have the ability to borrow funds on a short-term basis. On June 11, 2024, we amended the Adviser Revolver to increase the borrowing capacity under the Adviser Revolver from $100.0 million to $200.0 million.
•
During the third calendar quarter of 2024, the Golub Capital Employee Grant Program Rabbi Trust, or the Trust, purchased approximately $8.1 million, or 539,702, shares of our common stock for the purpose of awarding incentive compensation to employees of Golub Capital. Through the first three calendar quarters 
116
TABLE OF CONTENTS
of 2024, the Trust purchased approximately $8.2 million, or 544,702 shares of our common stock, for the purpose of awarding incentive compensation to employees of Golub Capital. During calendar year 2023, the Trust purchased approximately $18.0 million, or 1,306,855 shares of our common stock, for the purpose of awarding incentive compensation to employees of Golub Capital. 
•
Effective June 3, 2024, we assumed in the GBDC 3 Merger an unsecured line of credit with GC Advisors that allowed for borrowing up to $100.0 million, which we subsequently terminated effective June 11, 2024.
•
On September 16, 2019, we completed our acquisition of GCIC pursuant to the GCIC Merger Agreement. 
•
On June 3, 2024, we completed our acquisition of GBDC 3, pursuant to the GBDC 3 Merger Agreement, GBDC 3 was merged with and into us, with us as the surviving company. As a result of, and as of the effective time of the GBDC 3 Merger, GBDC 3’s separate existence ceased. 
GC Advisors also sponsors or manages, and expects in the future to sponsor or manage, other investment funds, accounts or investment vehicles (together referred to as “accounts”) that have investment mandates that are similar, in whole and in part, with ours. For example, GC Advisors presently serves as the investment adviser to Golub Capital Direct Lending Corporation, or GDLC, Golub Capital Direct Lending Unlevered Corporation, or GDLCU, Golub Capital BDC 4, Inc., or GBDC 4, and Golub Capital Private Credit Fund, or GCRED, all of which are unlisted business development companies that primarily focus on investing in one stop and other senior secured loans. In addition, our officers and directors serve in similar capacities for GDLC, GDLCU, GBDC 4 and GCRED. If GC Advisors and its affiliates determine that an investment is appropriate for us, GDLC, GDLCU, GBDC 4, GCRED and other accounts, depending on the availability of such investment and other appropriate factors, and pursuant to GC Advisors’ allocation policy, GC Advisors or its affiliates could determine that we should invest side-by-side with one or more other accounts. We do not intend to make any investments if they are not permitted by applicable law and interpretive positions of the SEC and its staff, or if they are inconsistent with GC Advisors’ allocation procedures.
In addition, we have adopted a formal code of ethics that governs the conduct of our and GC Advisors’ officers, directors and employees. Our officers and directors also remain subject to the duties imposed by both the 1940 Act and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following items as critical accounting policies.
Fair Value Measurements
We value investments for which market quotations are readily available at their market quotations. However, a readily available market value is not expected to exist for many of the investments in our portfolio, and we value these portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith. 
Pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, as recently amended, effective August 2, 2024, our board of directors, as permitted, has designated GC Advisors as the Company’s valuation designee (the “Valuation Designee”) to perform the determination of fair value of our investments for which market quotations are not readily available, or valued by a third-party pricing service, in accordance with our valuation policies and procedures, subject to the oversight of the board of directors.
Valuation methods include comparisons of the portfolio companies to peer companies that are public, determination of the enterprise value of a portfolio company, discounted cash flow analysis and a market interest rate approach. The factors that are taken into account in fair value pricing investments include: available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables; applicable market yields and multiples; security covenants; call protection provisions; information rights; the nature and realizable value of any

TABLE OF CONTENTS
collateral; the portfolio company’s ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows and the markets in which it does business; comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public; comparable merger and acquisition transactions; and the principal market and enterprise values. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we will consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate the private equity valuation. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments can differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments and differ materially from values that are ultimately received or settled.
Our valuation designee is ultimately and solely responsible for determining, in good faith, the fair value of investments that are not publicly traded, whose market prices are not readily available on a quarterly basis or any other situation where portfolio investments require a fair value determination.
With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, the valuation designee undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:
Our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of GC Advisors responsible for the valuation function. Preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with our senior management and GC Advisors. The valuation designee reviews these preliminary valuations. At least every other quarter, the valuation for each portfolio investment, subject to a de minimis threshold, is reviewed by an independent valuation firm. The valuation designee discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith.
Determination of fair values involves subjective judgments and estimates. Under current accounting standards, the notes to our consolidated financial statements refer to the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations, on our consolidated financial statements.
We follow ASC Topic 820 for measuring fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters, or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices or inputs are not available, valuation models are applied. These valuation models involve some level of estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the assets or liabilities or market and the assets’ or liabilities’ complexity. Our fair value analysis, currently undertaken by the Valuation Designee, includes an analysis of the value of any unfunded loan commitments. Assets and liabilities are categorized for disclosure purposes based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their value. The valuation hierarchical levels are based upon the transparency of the inputs to the valuation of the asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows:
Level 1:
 Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.
Level 2:
 Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3:
 Inputs include significant unobservable inputs for the assets or liabilities and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the assets or liabilities. The inputs into the determination of fair value are based upon the best information available and could require significant management judgment or estimation.
In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value could fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an asset’s or a liability’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and we consider factors specific to the asset or liability. The Valuation Designee assesses the levels of assets and liabilities at each measurement date, and transfers between levels are recognized on the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfers. There were no transfers among Level 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities during the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The following section describes the valuation techniques used by us to measure different assets and liabilities at fair value and includes the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the assets and liabilities are categorized.

Valuation of Investments
Level 1 investments are valued using quoted market prices. Level 2 investments are valued using market consensus prices that are corroborated by observable market data and quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities. Level 3 investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Valuation Designee, based on input of the Valuation Designee’s personnel and independent valuation firms that have been engaged by or at the direction of the Valuation Designee to assist in the valuation of each portfolio investment without a readily available market quotation at least every other quarter under a valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. This valuation process is conducted at the end of each fiscal quarter, with each portfolio investment being reviewed at least every other quarter (subject to a de minimis threshold) with approximately 50% (based on the fair value of portfolio company investments) of the Company’s valuations of debt and equity investments without readily available market quotations subject to review by an independent valuation firm.  Al
l investments a
s of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, with the exception of one portfolio company investment (Level 1 investments), were valued using Level 3 inputs. As of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, all money market funds included in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents were valued using Level 1 inputs and all forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps were valued using Level 2 inputs.
When determining fair value of Level 3 debt and equity investments, the Valuation Designee could take into account the following factors, where relevant: the enterprise value of a portfolio company, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company’s ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons to publicly traded securities, and changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets generally that could affect the price at which similar investments could be made and other relevant factors. The primary method for determining enterprise value uses a multiple analysis whereby appropriate multiples are applied to the portfolio company’s EBITDA. A portfolio company’s EBITDA could include pro-forma adjustments for items such as acquisitions, divestitures, or expense reductions. The enterprise value analysis is performed to determine the value of equity investments and to determine if debt investments are credit impaired. If debt investments are credit impaired, the Valuation Designee will use the enterprise value analysis or a liquidation basis analysis to determine fair value. For debt investments that are not determined to be credit impaired, the Valuation Designee uses a market interest rate yield analysis to determine fair value.
In addition, for certain debt investments, the Valuation Designee could base its valuation on indicative bid and ask prices provided by an independent third-party pricing service. Bid prices reflect the highest price that we and others could be willing to pay. Ask prices represent the lowest price that we and others may be willing to accept. The Valuation Designee generally uses the midpoint of the bid/ask range as our best estimate of fair value of such investment.
Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of Level 3 investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments could differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a market existed for such investments and could differ materially from the values that could ultimately be received or settled. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded instruments. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we could realize significantly less than the value at which such investment had previously been recorded.
Our investments are subject to market risk. Market risk is the potential for changes in the value due to market changes. Market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the investments are traded.

Valuation of Other Financial Assets and Liabilities
The fair value of the 2026 Notes, 2027 Notes, 2028 Notes and 2029 Notes is based on vendor pricing received by the Company, which is considered a Level 2 input. The fair value of our remaining debt is estimated using Level 3 inputs by discounting remaining payments using comparable market rates or market quotes for similar instruments at the measurement date, if available.
Revenue Recognition:
Our revenue recognition policies are as follows:
Investments and Related Investment Income:
  Interest income is accrued based upon the outstanding principal amount and contractual interest terms of debt investments. Original issue discount, market discount or premium and certain loan origination or amendment fees that are deemed to be an adjustment to yield (“Loan Origination Fees”) are capitalized and we accrete or amortize such amounts over the life of the loan as interest income (“Discount Amortization”). For investments with contractual PIK interest, which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the principal balance that generally becomes due at maturity, we do not accrue PIK interest if the portfolio company valuation indicates that the PIK interest is not likely to be collectible. In addition, we could generate revenue in the form of amendment, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance, administrative agent fees, consulting fees and prepayment premiums on loans that are not deemed to be an adjustment to yield and record these fees as fee income when earned. We record prepayment premiums on loans as fee income. Dividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. We have certain preferred equity securities in our portfolio that contain a PIK dividend provision that are accrued and recorded as income at the contractual rates, if deemed collectible. The accrued PIK and non-cash dividends are capitalized to the cost basis of the preferred equity security and are generally collected when redeemed by the issuer. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. Distributions received from limited liability company, or LLC, and limited partnership, or LP, investments are evaluated to determine if the distribution should be recorded as dividend income or a return of capital. Generally, we will not record distributions from equity investments in LLCs and LPs as dividend income unless there are sufficient accumulated tax-basis earnings and profits in the LLC or LP prior to the distribution. Distributions that are classified as a return of capital are recorded as a reduction in the cost basis of the investment. 
We account for investment transactions on a trade-date basis. Realized gains or losses on investments are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the cost basis of investment, without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We report changes in fair value of investments from the prior period that is measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investment transactions in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and fluctuations arising from the translation of foreign exchange rates on investments in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on translation of assets and liabilities in foreign currencies on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Non-accrual loans:
  Loans may be left on accrual status during the period we are pursuing repayment of the loan. Management reviews all loans that become past due 90 days or more on principal and interest or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected for possible placement on non-accrual status. We generally reverse accrued interest when a loan is placed on non-accrual. Additionally, any original issue discount and market discount are no longer accreted to interest income as of the date the loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans could be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management’s judgment. We restore non-accrual loans to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in our management’s judgment, are likely to remain current. The total fair value of our non-accrual loans was $93.2 million and $62.9 million as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
Income taxes:
  We

have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and operate in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. In order to be subject to tax as a RIC, we are required to meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements, as well as timely distribute to our stockholders dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes of an amount generally at least equal to 90% of investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code and determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid, for each 
120
TABLE OF CONTENTS
tax year. We have made and intend to continue to make the requisite distributions to our stockholders, which will generally relieve us from U.S. federal income taxes.
Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we could choose to retain taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions and would distribute such taxable income in the next tax year. We could then be required to incur a 4% excise tax on such income. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income, determined on a calendar year basis, could exceed estimated current calendar year dividend distributions, we accrue excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned. For the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, $1.1 million and $3.7 million, respectively, was recorded for U.S. federal excise tax. For the year ended September 20, 2022, we did not incur U.S. federal excise tax.
We have consolidated subsidiaries that are subject to U.S. federal and state corporate-level income taxes. For the year ended September 30, 2024, $0.1 million was recorded for U.S. income taxes. For the year ended
 September 30, 2023
, we recorded a net tax benefit of $0.1 million for taxable subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we recorded a net deferred tax liability, reported within accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition, of $0.8 million and $1.1 million, respectively, for taxable subsidiaries, primarily due to unrealized appreciation on the investments held at the taxable subsidiaries.
Because federal income tax regulations differ from GAAP, distributions in accordance with tax regulations could differ from net investment income and realized gains recognized for financial reporting purposes. Differences could be permanent or temporary. Permanent differences are reclassified within capital accounts in the financial statements to reflect their tax character. For example, permanent differences in classification could result from the treatment of distributions paid from short-term gains as ordinary income dividends for tax purposes. Temporary differences arise when certain items of income, expense, gain, or loss are recognized at some time in the future.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
We are subject to financial market risks, including valuation risk and changes in interest rates. 
Valuation Risk. 
Most of our investments will not have a readily available market price. To ensure accurate valuations, our investments are valued at fair value in good faith by the Investment Adviser, as our valuation designee, subject to the oversight of our board of trustees based on, among other things, the input of independent third-party valuation firms engaged at the direction of the valuation designee, and in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the investments we hold. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments could fluctuate from period to period, if we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded it.
Interest Rate Ris
k. Many of the loans in our portfolio have floating interest rates, and we expect that our loans in the future could also have floating interest rates. These loans are usually based on floating SOFR or another base rate and typically have interest rate reset provisions that adjust applicable interest rates under such loans to current market rates on a daily, monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, or annual basis. The loans that are subject to floating SOFR or another base rate are also typically subject to a minimum base rate, or floor, that we charge on our loans if the current market rates are below the respective floors. As of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the weighted average floor on loans subject to floating interest rates was 0.81% and 0.80%, respectively. The Class A, B and C-1 2018 Notes issued in connection with the 2018 Debt Securitization have floating rate interest provisions based on three-month SOFR that reset quarterly, as do the Class A-1 and B-1 GCIC 2018 Notes as issued as part of the GCIC 2018 Debt Securitization. The Class A GBDC 3 Notes and Class A GBDC 3 Loans issued in connection with the GBDC 3 2022-2 Debt Securitization have floating rate provisions based on three-month term SOFR, the Class A Senior Secured GBDC 3 Notes issued in connection with the GBDC 3 2022 Debt Securitization have floating rate interest provisions based on three-month term SOFR and the Class A, B, and C-1 GBDC 3 2021 Notes issued in connection with the GBDC 3 2021 Debt Securitization have floating rate interest provisions based on three-month SOFR plus a spread adjustment. The JPM Credit Facility has a floating interest rate provision that, as of September 30, 2024, is primarily based on an applicable base rate (as defined in Note 7) plus a spread that ranges from 1.75% to 1.875% plus a spread adjustment of 0.10% on SOFR borrowings. The GBDC 3 DB Credit Facility has a floating interest rate provision equal to three-month term SOFR plus a spread of 2.30%. We have entered into two interest rate swaps on the 2028 Notes and one interest rate swap on the 2029 Notes, these swaps have floating rate provisions based on one-month SOFR plus a spread of 3.327%, one-month SOFR plus a spread of 2.835% and one-month SOFR plus a spread of 2.444%, respectively. We expect that other credit facilities into which we enter in the future could have floating interest rate provisions.
Assuming that the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition as of September 30, 2024 were to remain constant and that we took no actions to alter interest rate sensitivity as of such date, the following table shows the annualized impact of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Although we believe that this analysis is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes as of September 30, 2024, it does not adjust for changes in the credit market, credit quality, the size and composition of the assets in our portfolio and other business developments, including borrowings under the Debt Securitizations, the JPM Credit Facility, the GBDC 3 DB Credit Facility, Adviser Revolver, or other borrowings, that could affect net increase in net assets resulting from operations, or net income. Accordingly, we can offer no assurances that actual results would not differ materially from the analysis above.
We have and, in the future, could hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as interest rate swaps, futures, options and forward contracts to the limited extent permitted under the 1940 Act and applicable commodities laws. While hedging activities could insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they could also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to the investments in our portfolio with fixed interest rates.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
The management of Golub Capital BDC, Inc. (“GBDC,” and collectively with its subsidiaries, the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” and “Golub Capital BDC”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control system is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.
Golub Capital BDC’s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions recorded necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our policies and procedures also provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of Golub Capital BDC, and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness as to future periods are subject to the risk that controls could become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures could deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of Golub Capital BDC’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework
 issued in 2013. Based on the assessment, management believes that, as of September 30, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
Golub Capital BDC’s independent registered public accounting firm that audited the financial statements has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. This report appears on page

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Golub Capital BDC, Inc. and Subsidiaries 
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of Golub Capital BDC, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company), including the consolidated schedules of investments, as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in net assets, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations, changes in its net assets, and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission

(2013 framework), and our report dated November 19, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.  Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.  Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  Our procedures included confirmation of investments owned as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, by correspondence with the custodians, the underlying investees and brokers.  Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosures to which it relates.

Valuation of investments using significant unobservable inputs and assumptions
Description of the Matter
At September 30, 2024, the fair value of the Company’s investments categorized as Level 3 investments within the fair value hierarchy (Level 3 investments) totaled $8,235,293 thousand. Management determines the fair value of the Company’s Level 3 investments by applying the methodologies outlined in Notes 2 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements and using significant unobservable inputs and assumptions. Determining the fair value of the Level 3 investments requires management to make judgments about the valuation methodologies (i.e., market approach or income approach) and significant unobservable inputs and assumptions including, among others, EBITDA multiples, revenue multiples, and market interest rates for similar loans with similar credit profiles, used in determining the fair value measurements.  
Auditing the fair value of the Company’s Level 3 investments was complex, as the unobservable inputs and assumptions used by the Company are highly judgmental, are sensitive to economic dislocations, and could have a significant effect on the fair value measurements of such investments.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s investment valuation process. This included controls over management’s assessment of the valuation methodologies and significant unobservable inputs and assumptions used in determining the fair value measurements of the Level 3 investments. 
Our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the Company’s valuation methodologies, testing the significant unobservable inputs and assumptions used by the Company in determining the fair value of the Company’s Level 3 investments, and testing the mathematical accuracy of the Company’s valuation calculations. For a sample of the Company’s Level 3 investments, and in some cases, with the involvement of our valuation specialists, we independently developed fair value estimates and compared them to the Company’s estimates. We developed our independent fair value estimates by using borrower financial information, which we compared to confirmations sent to the borrowers or agreements or underlying source documents provided to the Company by the borrowers, and available market information from third-party sources, such as market spreads, market multiples, and leverage. In developing our independent fair value estimates, we considered the impact of current economic conditions on trends in borrower financial information and the resulting fair value estimates. We also evaluated subsequent events and other available information and considered whether they corroborated or contradicted the Company’s year-end valuations.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Golub Capital BDC, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Golub Capital BDC, Inc. and Subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Golub Capital BDC, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on the COSO criteria. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated statements of financial condition, including the consolidated schedules of investments, of the Company as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in net assets, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated November 19, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

For each, the Company has provided the spread over the applicable index and the weighted average current interest rate in effect as of September 30, 2024. Certain investments are subject to an interest rate floor. For fixed rate loans, a spread above a reference rate is not applicable. For positions with multiple outstanding contracts, the spread for the largest outstanding contract is shown. Listed below are the index rates as of September 30, 2024, which was the last business day of the period on which the applicable index rates were determined. The actual index rate for each loan listed could not be the applicable index rate outstanding as of September 30, 2024, as the loan could have priced or repriced based on an index rate prior to September 30, 2024.

(4)
The fair values of investments were valued using significant unobservable inputs, unless noted otherwise. See “Note 6. Fair Value Measurements”.

The majority of the investments bear interest at a rate that is permitted to be determined by reference to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR” or “SF”), Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR” or “E”), Prime (“P”), Sterling Overnight Index Average ("SONIA" or “SN”), Australian Interbank Rate (”AUD” or ”A”), Canadian Bankers Acceptance Rate (”CDOR” or "C”) or London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR” or “L”) denominated in U.S. dollars which reset daily, monthly, quarterly, semiannually, or annually. For each, the Company has provided the spread over the applicable index and the weighted average current interest rate in effect as of September 30, 2023. Certain investments are subject to an interest rate floor. For fixed rate loans, a spread above a reference rate is not applicable. For positions with multiple outstanding contracts, the spread for the largest outstanding contract is shown. Listed below are the index rates as of September 30, 2023, which was the last business day of the period on which the applicable index rates were determined.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  
(In thousands, except shares and per share data)
Note 1. Organization 
Golub Capital BDC, Inc. (“GBDC” and, collectively with its consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company”) is an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company. GBDC has elected to be regulated as a business development company (“BDC”) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, GBDC has elected to be treated as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). 
The Company’s investment strategy is to invest primarily in one stop (a loan that combines characteristics of traditional first lien senior secured loans and second lien or subordinated loans and that are often referred to by other middle-market lenders as unitranche loans) and other senior secured loans of U.S. middle-market companies that are, in most cases, sponsored by private equity firms. The Company also selectively invests in second lien and subordinated (a loan that ranks senior only to a borrower’s equity securities and ranks junior to all of such borrower’s other indebtedness in priority of payment) loans of, and warrants and minority equity securities in, U.S. middle-market companies. The Company has entered into the Fifth Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement effective as of June 3, 2024 (the “Investment Advisory Agreement” or “Post-GBDC 3 Merger Advisory Agreement”) with GC Advisors LLC (the “Investment Adviser”), under which the Investment Adviser manages the day-to-day operations of, and provides investment advisory services to, the Company. Under an administration agreement (the “Administration Agreement”) the Company is provided with certain services by an administrator (the “Administrator”), which is currently Golub Capital LLC.
On September 16, 2019, the Company completed its acquisition of Golub Capital Investment Corporation (“GCIC”), a Maryland corporation, pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the “GCIC Merger Agreement”), dated as of November 27, 2018, by and among the Company, GCIC, Fifth Ave Subsidiary Inc., a Maryland corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, the Investment Adviser, and, for certain limited purposes, the Administrator. 
On June 3, 2024, the Company completed its acquisition of Golub Capital BDC 3, Inc. (“GBDC 3”), a Maryland corporation pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the “GBDC 3 Merger Agreement”), dated as of January 16, 2024, by and among the Company, GBDC 3, Park Avenue Subsidiary Inc., a Maryland corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), GC Advisors, a Delaware limited liability company and investment adviser to each of the Company and GBDC 3, and, for certain limited purposes, Golub Capital LLC. Pursuant to the GBDC 3 Merger Agreement, Merger Sub was first merged with and into GBDC 3, with GBDC 3 as the surviving corporation (the “Initial GBDC 3 Merger”), and immediately following the Initial GBDC 3 Merger, GBDC 3 was then merged with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving company (the Initial GBDC 3 Merger and the subsequent merger, collectively, the “GBDC 3 Merger”). Upon consummation of the GBDC 3 Merger, the Company entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement. The Investment Advisory Agreement replaced the Fourth Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement by and between the Company and the Investment Adviser dated as of July 1, 2023 (the “Prior Investment Advisory Agreement”). Refer to Note 3 for more information on the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Prior Investment Advisory Agreement and refer to Note 15. Acquisition of Golub Capital BDC 3, Inc for discussion of the GBDC 3 Merger.
Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Updates 
Basis of presentation:
  The Company is an investment company as defined in the accounting and reporting guidance under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 946 — 
Financial Services 
—
 Investment Companies
 (“ASC Topic 946”).
The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company and related financial information have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) as established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) for financial information and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-K and Regulation S-X. In the opinion of management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments and reclassifications consisting solely of normal accruals that are necessary for the fair presentation of financial results as of and for the periods presented. All intercompany balances

and transactions have been eliminated. 
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

Fair value of financial instruments:
 The Company applies fair value to all of its financial instruments in accordance with ASC Topic 820 — 
Fair Value Measurement 
(“ASC Topic 820”). ASC Topic 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework used to measure fair value and requires disclosures for fair value measurements. On August 2, 2024, the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”) designated the Investment Adviser as the Company’s valuation designee (“Valuation Designee”) in accordance with Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act. As of such date, the Valuation Designee is responsible for determining the fair value of the Company’s portfolio investments, subject to oversight of the Board. In accordance with ASC Topic 820, the Valuation Designee has categorized the Company’s financial instruments carried at fair value, based on the priority of the valuation technique, into a three-level fair value hierarchy. Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of the market participant who holds the financial instrument rather than an entity-specific measure. Therefore, when market assumptions are not readily available, the Investment Adviser’s own assumptions are set to reflect those that management believes market participants would use in pricing the financial instrument at the measurement date. 
The availability of observable inputs can vary depending on the financial instrument and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the type of product, whether the product is new, whether the product is traded on an active exchange or in the secondary market and the current market conditions. To the extent that the valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Valuation Designee in determining fair value is greatest for financial instruments classified as Level 3.
Any changes to the valuation methodology are reviewed by management and the Board to confirm that the changes are appropriate. As markets change, new products develop and the pricing for products becomes more or less transparent, the Valuation Designee will continue to refine its valuation methodologies.
 See further description of fair value methodology in Note 6 Fair Value Measurements.
Use of estimates:
  The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Consolidation:
  As provided under Regulation S-X and ASC Topic 946, the Company will generally not consolidate its investment in a company other than an investment company subsidiary or a controlled operating company whose business consists of providing services to the Company.

Accordingly, the Company consolidated the results of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries listed in the table below in its consolidated financial statements:

Assets related to transactions that do not meet ASC Topic 860 requirements for accounting sale treatment are reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as investments. Those assets are owned by special purpose entities, including BDC Holdings, 2018 Issuer, Funding II, GCIC Holdings, GCIC 2018 Issuer, GBDC 3 Holdings, GBDC 3 Funding, GBDC 3 2021 Issuer, GBDC 3 2022 Issuer and the GBDC 3 2022-2 Issuer, that are consolidated in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The creditors of the special purpose entities have received security interests in such assets and such assets are not intended to be available to the creditors of GBDC (or any affiliate of GBDC).
Cash and cash equivalents and foreign currencies:
  Cash and cash equivalents and foreign currencies are highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition. The Company deposits its cash in financial institutions and, at times, such balances exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits.
Restricted cash and cash equivalents and restricted foreign currencies:
  Restricted cash and cash equivalents and restricted foreign currencies include amounts that are collected and are held by trustees who have been appointed as custodians of the assets securing certain of the Company’s financing transactions. Restricted cash and cash equivalents and restricted foreign currencies are held by the trustees for payment of interest expense and principal on the outstanding borrowings or reinvestment into new assets.
Foreign currency translation: 
The Company’s books and records are maintained in U.S. dollars. Any foreign currency amounts are translated into U.S. dollars. Non-U.S. dollar transactions during the year are valued at the prevailing spot rates on the applicable transaction date and the related assets and liabilities are revalued at the prevailing spot rates as of year-end. 
Net assets and fair values are presented based on the applicable foreign exchange rates and fluctuations arising from the translation of assets and liabilities are included with the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on translation of assets and liabilities in foreign currencies on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
226
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Golub Capital BDC, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  
(In thousands, except shares and per share data)
Foreign security and currency transactions involve certain considerations and risks not typically associated with investing in U.S. companies. These risks include, but are not limited to, currency fluctuations and revaluations and future adverse political, social and economic developments, which could cause investments in foreign markets to be less liquid and prices more volatile than those of comparable U.S. companies or U.S. government securities.
Derivative Instruments:
The Company follows the guidance in ASC Topic 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging
 (“ASC Topic 815”), when accounting for derivative instruments.
Forward currency contracts:

A forward currency contract is an obligation between two parties to purchase or sell a specific currency for an agreed-upon price at a future date. The Company utilized forward currency contracts to economically hedge the currency exposure associated with certain foreign-denominated investments. The use of forward currency contracts does not eliminate fluctuations in the price of the underlying securities the Company owns or intends to acquire but establishes a rate of exchange in advance. Fluctuations in the value of these contracts are measured by the difference in the exchange rates on the contract date and reporting date and are recorded as unrealized appreciation (depreciation) until the contracts are closed. When the contracts are closed, realized gains (losses) are recorded. Realized gains (losses) and unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on the contracts are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on forward currency contracts is recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition by counterparty on a net basis, not taking into account collateral posted which is recorded separately, if applicable.
The primary risks associated with forward currency contracts include failure of the counterparty to meet the terms of the contract and the value of the foreign currency changing unfavorably. These risks can exceed the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. 
Refer to Note 5 for more information regarding the forward currency contracts.
Interest rate swaps:

The Company designated interest rate swaps as the hedging instrument in qualifying fair value hedge accounting relationships, and as a result, the change in fair value of the hedging instruments and hedged items are recorded in interest expense and recognized as components of “interest expense” in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations. The fair value of the interest rate swaps is included as a component of “Net unrealized appreciation on derivatives” on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Refer to Note 5 for more information regarding the interest rate swaps.

Revenue recognition:
Investments and related investment income:
  Interest income is accrued based upon the outstanding principal amount and contractual interest terms of debt investments.
Original issue discount, market discount or premium and certain loan origination or amendment fees that are deemed to be an adjustment to yield (“Loan Origination Fees”) are capitalized and the Company accretes or amortizes such amounts over the life of the loan as interest income (“Discount Amortization”).
 For the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company received Loan Origination Fees that were capitalized of $
19,817
, $
17,692
, and $
27,023
, respectively. For the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, interest income included $
22,074
, $
19,951
 and $
24,679
, respectively, of Discount Amortization. 
For investments with contractual payment-in-kind (“PIK”) interest, which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the principal balance that generally becomes due at maturity, the Company will not accrue PIK interest if the portfolio company valuation indicates that the PIK interest is not collectible.
 For the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, investment income included $
49,715
, $
40,590
 and $
23,354
, respectively, of PIK interest and the Company capitalized PIK interest of $
52,552
, $
38,844
 and $
21,506
, respectively, into the principal balance of certain debt investments.
In addition, the Company generates revenue in the form of amendment, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance, consulting fees, administrative agent fees, and prepayment premiums on loans. The 
227
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Golub Capital BDC, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  
(In thousands, except shares and per share data)
Company records these fees that are not deemed to be an adjustment to yield as fee income when earned. 
For the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, fee income included $
606
, $
79
 and $
3,040
 from non-recurring prepayment premiums, respectively. Other income is recorded into income when earned. 
For the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company received interest and fee income in cash, which excludes capitalized loan origination fees, in the amounts of $
626,622
, $
496,114
 and $
354,032
, respectively.
Dividend income on equity securities is recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. The Company has certain preferred equity securities in the portfolio that contain a PIK dividend provision that are accrued and recorded as income at the contractual rates, if deemed collectible. The accrued PIK and non-cash dividends are capitalized to the cost basis of the preferred equity security and are generally collected when redeemed by the issuer. 
For the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized PIK and non-cash dividend income of $
21,264
 and $
14,901
, respectively, which were capitalized into the cost basis of certain preferred equity investments. For the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company had 
no
 capitalized PIK and non-cash dividends. For the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company received $
47
 and $
10
, respectively, of cash payments of accrued and capitalized preferred dividends. For the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company received 
no
 cash payments of accrued and capitalized preferred dividends in cash.
Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. Each distribution received from limited liability company (“LLC”) and limited partnership (“LP”) investments is evaluated to determine if the distribution should be recorded as dividend income or a return of capital. Generally, the Company will not record distributions from equity investments in LLCs and LPs as dividend income unless there are sufficient accumulated tax-basis earnings and profits in the LLC or LP prior to the distribution. Distributions that are classified as a return of capital are recorded as a reduction in the cost basis of the investment.

For the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded dividend income received in cash of $
691
, $
1,340
 and $
684
, respectively, and return of capital distributions received in cash of $
1,622
, $
373
 and $
1,146
, respectively.
Investment transactions are accounted for on a trade-date basis. Realized gains or losses on investments are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of investment, without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. The Company reports current period changes in fair value of investments that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investment transactions in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Non-accrual loans:
  A loan can be left on accrual status during the year the Company is pursuing repayment of the loan. Management reviews all loans that become 90 days or more past due on principal and interest, or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected, for possible placement on non-accrual status. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, unpaid interest credited to income is reversed. Additionally, any original issue discount and market discount are no longer accreted to interest income as of the date the loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans are recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management’s judgment. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in management’s judgment, payments are likely to remain current.
 The total fair value of non-accrual loans was $
93,204

Asset Acquisition: 
Pursuant to the GCIC Merger Agreement, the GCIC Merger Sub was first merged with and into GCIC, with GCIC as the surviving company (the “Initial GCIC Merger”), and, immediately following the Initial GCIC Merger, GCIC was then merged with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving company (the Initial GCIC Merger and the subsequent merger, collectively, the “GCIC Merger”). Pursuant to the GBDC 3 Merger Agreement, the GBDC 3 Merger Sub was first merged with and into GBDC 3, with GBDC 3 as the surviving company in the Initial GBDC 3 Merger and, immediately following the Initial GBDC 3 Merger, GBDC 3 was then merged with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving company. The GCIC Merger and the GBDC 3 Merger were accounted for under the asset acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805 —

 (“ASC Topic 805”), also referred to as “asset acquisition.” Under the asset acquisition method of accounting, acquiring assets in groups not only requires ascertaining the cost of the asset (or net assets), but also allocating that cost to the individual assets (or individual assets and liabilities) that make up the group. Per ASC Topic 805, assets are recognized based on their cost to the acquiring entity, which generally includes transaction costs of the asset acquisition, and no gain or loss is recognized unless the fair value of non-cash assets given as consideration differs from the assets carrying amounts on the acquiring entity’s books.
The cost of the group of assets acquired in an asset acquisition is allocated to the individual assets acquired or liabilities assumed based on the relative fair values of net identifiable assets acquired other than “non-qualifying” assets (for example cash) and does not give rise to goodwill. To the extent that the consideration paid to GCIC or GBDC 3’s stockholders exceeded the relative fair values of the net identifiable assets of GCIC or GBDC 3 acquired other than “non-qualifying” assets, any such premium paid by the Company was further allocated to the cost of the GCIC or GBDC 3 assets acquired by the Company pro-rata to their relative fair value, other than “non-qualifying” assets. As both GCIC and GBDC 3 did not have any “qualifying” assets at the time of acquisition, the premium was allocated to “non-qualifying” assets, which are GCIC and GBDC 3’s investments in loans and equity securities, including its investment in GCIC SLF. Immediately following the acquisitions of GCIC and GBDC 3, the Company recorded its assets at their respective fair values and, as a result, the purchase premium allocated to the cost basis of the GCIC and GBDC 3 assets acquired were immediately recognized as unrealized depreciation on the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations. The purchase premium allocated to investments in loan securities will amortize over the life of the loans through interest income, with a corresponding reversal of the unrealized depreciation on the loans acquired from GCIC and GBDC 3 through their ultimate disposition.
 Amortization expense of purchase premium for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $
11,671
, $
7,073
 and $
15,632
, respectively. 
The purchase premium allocated to investments in equity securities will not amortize over the life of the equity securities through interest income and, assuming no subsequent change to the fair value of the equity securities acquired from GCIC or GBDC 3 and disposition of such equity securities at fair value, the Company will recognize a realized loss with a corresponding reversal of the unrealized depreciation upon disposition of the equity securities acquired from GCIC or GBDC 3.
Income taxes:
  The Company has elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and operates in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. In order to qualify and be subject to tax as a RIC, among other things, the Company is required to meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements and timely distribute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to its stockholders of an amount generally at least equal to 90% of investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code and determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid, for each tax year. The Company has made, and intends to continue to make, the requisite distributions to its stockholders, which will generally relieve the Company from U.S. federal income taxes with respect to all income distributed to its stockholders.
Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, the Company can determine to retain taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions and distribute such taxable income in the next tax year. The Company could then be required to incur a 4% excise tax on such income. To the extent that the Company determines that its estimated current year annual taxable income, determined on a calendar year basis, could exceed estimated current calendar year dividend distributions, the Company accrues excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned. For the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, $
1,124
 and $
3,682
, respectively, was recorded for U.S. federal excise tax. For the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company did 
not
 record any U.S. federal excise tax. 
The Company accounts for income taxes in conformity with ASC Topic 740 — 
Income Taxes
 (“ASC Topic 740”). ASC Topic 740 provides guidelines for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. ASC Topic 740 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken in the course of preparing the Company’s tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are “more-likely-than-not” to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax benefits of positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax expense or tax benefit in the current year. It is the Company’s policy to recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits in income tax expense. There were no material unrecognized tax benefits or unrecognized tax liabilities related to uncertain income tax positions through September 30, 2024. The Company's tax returns for the 
2021 through 2023 
tax years remain subject to examination by U.S. federal and most state tax authorities.

Certain of the Company's consolidated subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal and state corporate-level income taxes. Income tax expense, if any, is included under the income category for which it applies in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Dividends and distributions:
  Dividends and distributions to common stockholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The amount to be paid out as a dividend or distribution is determined by the Board each quarter and is generally based upon the earnings estimated by management. Net realized capital gains, if any, are distributed at least annually, although the Company can retain such capital gains for investment in its discretion.
The Company has adopted a dividend reinvestment plan (“DRIP”) that provides for reinvestment of any distributions the Company declares in cash on behalf of its stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash. As a result, if the Board authorizes and the Company declares a cash distribution, then stockholders who participate in the DRIP will have their cash distribution reinvested in additional shares of the Company’s common stock, rather than receiving the cash distribution. The Company expects to use newly issued shares under the guidelines of the DRIP if the Company’s shares are trading at a premium to net asset value. The Company can purchase shares in the open market in connection with the obligations under the plan, and in particular, if the Company’s shares are trading at a significant discount to net asset value (“NAV”) and the Company is otherwise permitted under applicable law to purchase such shares, the Company intends to purchase shares in the open market in connection with any obligations under the DRIP.
In the event the market price per share of the Company’s common stock on the date of a distribution exceeds the most recently computed NAV per share of the common stock, the Company will issue shares of common stock to participants in the DRIP at the greater of the most recently computed NAV per share of common stock or 95% of the current market price per share of common stock (or such lesser discount to the current market price per share that still exceeds the most recently computed NAV per share of common stock).
Share repurchase plan:
 The Company has a share repurchase program (the “Program”) which allows the Company to repurchase the Company’s outstanding common stock on the open market at prices below the Company’s NAV as reported in its most recently published consolidated financial statements. The Board reapproved the Program in August 2024 and the Program is implemented at the discretion of management. Shares can be purchased from time to time at prevailing market prices, through open market transactions, including block transactions. 
The Program permits repurchases up to $
150,000
 of the Company's common stock. Refer to Note 13 for more information on the share repurchases under the Program. 
Equity Distribution Agreemen
t: On October 6, 2023, the Company entered into a new equity distribution agreement (the “2023 Equity Distribution Agreement”), by and among the Company, the Investment Adviser, Golub Capital LLC and Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. and Regions Securities LLC (the “Placement Agents”), in connection with the sale by the Company of shares of its common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $
250,000
, in an “at the market offering,” in amounts and at times to be determined by the Company. Actual sales, if any, will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the Company from time to time, including, among others, market conditions and the market price of the Company’s common stock. The 2023 Equity Distribution Agreement provides that the Company could offer and sell shares from time to time through, or to, the Placement Agents, or to it. Sales of the shares, if any, could be made in negotiated transactions or transactions that are deemed to be “at the market,” as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including sales made directly on The Nasdaq Global Select Market or any similar securities exchange or sales made to or through a market maker other than on a securities exchange, at prices related to the prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices. Pursuant to the terms of the 2023 Equity Distribution Agreement, the Placement Agents will receive a commission from the Company of up to 
1.50
% of the gross sales price of any shares sold through the Placement Agents under the 2023 Equity Distribution Agreement. Offering costs for the 2023 Equity Distribution Agreement are charged against the proceeds from equity offerings when proceeds are received.
 During the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company terminated the equity distribution agreement entered into on May 28, 2021 by and among the Company, the Investment Adviser, Golub Capital LLC and SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc. (the “2021 Equity Distribution Agreement”). During the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company did 
not
 issue any shares of common stock under the 2021 or 2023 Equity Distribution Agreements.

Investment Advisory Agreement:
  Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Investment Adviser manages the day-to-day operations of, and provides investment advisory services to, GBDC. The Board approved the Investment Advisory Agreement on January 16, 2024. The Investment Advisory Agreement amended the Prior Investment Advisory Agreement in order to incorporate changes to the calculation of the incentive fee rates and the incentive fee cap. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the incentive fee rates were reduced from 
20.0
% to 
15.0
%, and the incentive fee cap was reduced from 
20.0
% to 
15.0
%. None of the other material terms changed in the  Investment Advisory Agreement as compared to the Prior Investment Advisory Agreement, including the services to be provided and the calculation of the base management fee. The Investment Advisory Agreement was entered into and effective as of June 3, 2024, the closing of the GBDC 3 Merger. On August 3, 2023, effective as of July 1, 2023, the Board approved the Prior Investment Advisory Agreement, pursuant to which the base management fee rate was reduced from 
1.375
% to 
1.0
%. The Investment Adviser is a registered investment adviser with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The Investment Adviser receives fees for providing services, consisting of 
two
 components, a base management fee and an Incentive Fee (as defined below).
The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate equal to 
1.0
% (or 
1.375
% for periods ending on or before June 30, 2023) of the fair value of the average adjusted gross assets of the Company at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters (including assets purchased with borrowed funds and securitization-related assets, leverage, unrealized depreciation or appreciation on derivative instruments and cash collateral on deposit for such derivative instruments with custodian but adjusted to exclude cash and cash equivalents so that investors do not pay the base management fee on such assets) and is payable quarterly in arrears. Additionally, the Investment Adviser voluntarily excludes any assets funded with secured borrowing proceeds from the base management fee calculation. The base management fee is adjusted, based on the actual number of days elapsed relative to the total number of days in such calendar quarter, for any share issuances or repurchases during such calendar quarter. For purposes of the Investment Advisory Agreement, cash equivalents mean U.S. government securities and commercial paper instruments maturing within 
270
 days of purchase (which is different than the GAAP definition, which defines cash equivalents as U.S. government securities and commercial paper instruments maturing within 90 days of purchase). To the extent that the Investment Adviser or any of its affiliates provides investment advisory, collateral

management or other similar services to a subsidiary of the Company, the base management fee will be reduced by an amount equal to the product of (1) the total fees paid to the Investment Adviser by such subsidiary for such services and (2) the percentage of such subsidiary’s total equity, including membership interests and any class of notes not exclusively held by one or more third parties, that is owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company. 
The Investment Adviser serves as collateral manager under the 2018 Collateral Management Agreement (as described in Note 7), the GCIC 2018 Collateral Management Agreement (as described in Note 7), the 2021 Collateral Management Agreement (as described in Note 7), the 2022 Collateral Management Agreement (as described in Note 7) and the 2022-2 Collateral Management Agreement (as described in Note 7). Fees payable to the Investment Adviser for providing these services are offset against the base management fee payable by the Company under the Investment Advisory Agreement.
The base management fee incurred for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $
62,514
 and $
70,802
, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Investment Adviser irrevocably waived $
1,904
 of base management fees. After taking into account the waiver by the Investment Adviser, the base management fee incurred was $
71,962
 rather than $
73,866
 for the year ended September 30, 2022.
The Company has structured the calculation of the Incentive Fee to include a fee limitation such that an Incentive Fee for any quarter can only be paid to the Investment Adviser if, after such payment, the cumulative Incentive Fees paid to the Investment Adviser, calculated on a per share basis, since April 13, 2010, the effective date of the Company’s election to become a BDC, would be less than or equal to 
15.0
% of the Company’s Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Income (as defined below).
The Company accomplishes this limitation by subjecting each quarterly Incentive Fee payable under the Income and Capital Gain Incentive Fee Calculation (as defined below) to a cap (the “Incentive Fee Cap”). Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Incentive Fee Cap in any quarter is equal to the difference between (a) 
15.0
% of Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Income Per Share (as defined below) and (b) Cumulative Incentive Fees Paid Per Share (as defined below). To the extent the Incentive Fee Cap is zero or a negative value in any quarter, no Incentive Fee would be payable in that quarter. If, for any relevant period, the Incentive Fee Cap calculation results in the Company paying less than the amount of the Incentive Fee calculated above, then the difference between the Incentive Fee and the Incentive Fee Cap will not be paid by GBDC and will not be received by the Investment Adviser as an Incentive Fee either at the end of such relevant period or at the end of any future period. “Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Income Per Share” equals the sum of “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Income Per Share” (as defined below) for each quarterly period since April 13, 2010. “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Income Per Share” equals the sum of (i) Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (as defined below) and (ii) Adjusted Capital Returns for the applicable period, divided by (b) the weighted average number of shares of GBDC common stock outstanding during such period. “Adjusted Capital Returns” for any period is the sum of the realized aggregate capital gains, realized aggregate capital losses, aggregate unrealized capital depreciation and aggregate unrealized capital appreciation for such period; provided that the calculation of realized aggregate capital gains, realized aggregate capital losses, aggregate unrealized capital depreciation and aggregate unrealized capital appreciation shall not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation resulting solely from the asset acquisition for any premium or discount paid for the acquisition of assets in a merger. “Cumulative Incentive Fees Paid Per Share” is equal to the sum of Incentive Fees Paid Per Share since April 13, 2010. “Incentive Fees Paid Per Share” for any period is equal to the Incentive Fees accrued and/or payable to the Company for such period, divided by the weighted average number of shares of common stock of GBDC during such period.
“Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income” means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Company receives from portfolio companies but excluding fees for providing managerial assistance) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus operating expenses for the calendar quarter (including the base management fee, taxes, any expenses payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement, any expenses of securitizations and any interest expense and dividends paid on any outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the Incentive Fee). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature such as market discount, debt instruments with PIK interest, preferred stock with PIK dividends and zero coupon securities, accrued income that the Company has not yet received in cash.

Incentive Fees are calculated and payable quarterly in arrears (or, upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date).
The income and capital gains incentive fee calculation (the “Income and Capital Gain Incentive Fee Calculation”) has two parts, the income component (the “Income Incentive Fee”) and the capital gains component (the “Capital Gain Incentive Fee” and, together with the Income Incentive Fee, the “Incentive Fee”). The Income Incentive Fee is calculated quarterly in arrears based on the Company’s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter.
For the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Income Incentive Fee incurred was $
77,163
, $
74,066
 and $
17,756
, respectively.
On January 16, 2024, the Investment Adviser agreed to irrevocably waive any incentive fees in excess of 
15
% and waive incentive fees in excess of an incentive fee cap that is also reduced to 
15
%, in each case effective as of January 1, 2024, for periods ending on or prior to the earlier of (i) the closing of the acquisition of GBDC 3 pursuant to the GBDC 3 Merger Agreement or (ii) the termination of the GBDC 3 Merger Agreement (the “Waiver Period”), in accordance with the terms of a waiver letter agreement (the “GBDC 3 Merger Waiver”) to the Prior Investment Advisory Agreement. During the Waiver Period, as a result of the GBDC 3 Merger Waiver, fees payable to the Investment Adviser under the Prior Investment Advisory Agreement, net of the GBDC 3 Merger Waiver, will equal those that would be payable under the Post-GBDC 3 Merger Advisory Agreement. During the year ended September 30, 2024, the Investment Adviser irrevocably waived $
5,157
 of income incentive fees under the GBDC 3 Merger Waiver.
In addition, the Investment Adviser unilaterally agreed to irrevocably waive 100% of the Income Incentive Fee payable to the Investment Advisor under the Investment Advisory Agreement for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and $
7,767
 for the three months ended September 30, 2024.
For the year ended September 30, 2024, the Investment Adviser irrevocably waived income incentive fees, including the GBDC 3 Merger Waiver, of $
27,324
.  For the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Investment Adviser waived 
no
 income incentive fees.
The Investment Advisory Agreement excludes the impact of asset acquisition resulting from a merger, including the GCIC Merger and GBDC 3 Merger, from the calculation of income subject to the Income Incentive Fee and the calculation of the Incentive Fee Cap. As a result, under the Investment Advisory Agreement, Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation or any amortization or accretion of any purchase premium or discount to interest income solely from the asset acquisition for any premium or discount paid for the acquisition of assets in a merger, such as the premium to net asset value paid for the shares of GCIC and GBDC 3 common stock in the GCIC Merger and GBDC 3 Merger. Because of the structure of the Income Incentive Fee, it is possible that an Incentive Fee is calculated under this formula with respect to a period in which the Company has incurred a loss. For example, if the Company receives Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income in excess of the hurdle rate (as defined below) for a calendar quarter, the Income Incentive Fee will result in a positive value and an Incentive Fee will be paid even if the Company has incurred a loss in such period due to realized and/or unrealized capital losses unless the payment of such Incentive Fee would cause the Company to pay Incentive Fees on a cumulative basis that exceed the Incentive Fee Cap. 
Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of the Company’s net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness and before taking into account any Incentive Fees payable during the period) at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to a fixed “hurdle rate” of 
2.0
% quarterly. 
If market interest rates rise, it is possible that the Company will be able to invest funds in debt instruments that provide for a higher return, which would increase Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income and make it easier for the Investment Adviser to surpass the fixed hurdle rate and receive an Incentive Fee based on such net investment income.

The Company’s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income used to calculate this part of the Incentive Fee is also included in the amount of the Company’s total assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed funds and securitization-related assets, unrealized depreciation or appreciation on derivative instruments and cash collateral on deposit with custodian) used to calculate the base management fee annua
l rate.
For periods ending on or before March 31, 2024, the Company calculates the Income Incentive Fee with respect to its Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income quarterly, in arrears, as follows:
•
Zero
 in any calendar quarter in which the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed the hurdle rate;
•
100
% of the Company’s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 
2.5
% in any calendar quarter. This portion of the Company’s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 
2.5
%) is referred to as the “catch-up” provision. The catch-up is meant to provide the Investment Adviser with 
20.0
% of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income as if a hurdle rate did not apply if the Company’s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds 
2.5
% in any calendar quarter; and
•
20.0
% of the amount of the Company’s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds 
2.5
% in any calendar quarter.
For periods ending after June 3, 2024, including the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company calculates the Income Incentive Fee with respect to its Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income quarterly, in arrea
rs, as follows:
•
Zero
 in any calendar quarter in which the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed the hurdle rate;
•
100
% of the Company’s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than the percentage at which amounts payable to the Adviser equals 
15.0
% of the Company's Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income as if a hurdle rate did not apply. This portion of the Company’s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income is referred to as the “catch-up” provision. The catch-up is meant to provide the Investment Adviser with 
15.0
% of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income as if a hurdle rate did not apply; and
•
15.0
% of the amount of the Company’s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the catch-up provision in any calendar quarter.
The Capital Gain Incentive Fee equals (a) 
15.0
% of the Company’s Capital Gain Incentive Fee Base (as defined below), if any, calculated in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), which commenced with the calendar year ending December 31, 2010, less (b) the aggregate amount of any previously paid Capital Gain Incentive Fees. The Company’s “Capital Gain Incentive Fee Base” equals (1) the sum of (A) realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative positive basis from the date the Company elected to become a BDC through the end of each calendar year, (B) all realized capital losses on a cumulative basis and (C) all unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis less (2) all unamortized deferred debt issuance costs, if and to the extent such costs exceed all unrealized capital appreciation on a cumulative basis.
•
The cumulative aggregate realized capital losses are calculated as the sum of the amounts by which (a) the net sales price of each investment in the Company’s portfolio when sold is less than (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment.
•
The cumulative aggregate realized capital gains are calculated as the sum of the differences, if positive, between (a) the net sales price of each investment in the Company’s portfolio when sold and (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment.
•
The aggregate unrealized capital depreciation is calculated as the sum of the differences, if negative, between (a) the valuation of each investment in the Company’s portfolio as of the applicable Capital Gain Incentive Fee calculation date and (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  
(In thousands, except shares and per share data)
Realized capital gains and losses include gains and losses on investments, foreign currencies, including gains and losses on borrowings in foreign currencies, derivative contracts and any income tax related to cumulative aggregate realized gains and losses. 
For the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company did 
no
t accrue a Capital Gain Incentive Fee. As of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, there was 
no
 Capital Gain Incentive Fee payable as calculated under the Investment Advisory Agreement as described above. Any payment due for a Capital Gain Incentive Fee under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement is calculated in arrears at the end of each calendar year. 
In accordance with GAAP, the Company also is required to include the aggregate unrealized capital appreciation on investments in the calculation and accrue a capital gain incentive fee on a quarterly basis as if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee actually payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement, as applicable. If the Capital Gain Incentive Fee Base, adjusted as required by GAAP to include unrealized capital appreciation, is positive at the end of a period, then GAAP requires the Company to accrue a capital gain incentive fee equal to 
15
% of such amount, less the aggregate amount of the actual Capital Gain Incentive Fees paid and capital gain incentive fees accrued under GAAP in all prior periods. If such amount is negative, then there is no accrual for such period. The resulting accrual under GAAP in a given period results in additional expense if such cumulative amount is greater than in the prior period or a reversal of previously recorded expense if such cumulative amount is less than in the prior period. There can be no assurance that such unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future. For the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company did 
not

In order to better define its contractual rights and to secure rights that will help the Company mitigate its counterparty risk, the Company has entered into an International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. Master Agreement (“ISDA Master Agreement”) with each of its derivative counterparties, Macquarie Bank Limited (“Macquarie”) and SMBC Capital Markets, Inc. (“SMBC” and, together with Macquarie, the “Counterparties” and each a “Counterparty”). Each ISDA Master Agreement is a bilateral agreement between the Company and each Counterparty that governs over the counter (“OTC”) derivatives, including forward currency contracts, and contains, among other things, collateral posting terms and netting provisions in the event of a default and/or termination event. The provisions of each ISDA Master Agreements with each of the Counterparties permits a single net payment in the event of a default (close-out netting) or similar event, including the bankruptcy or insolvency of the counterparty. 
For financial reporting purposes, cash collateral that has been pledged to cover obligations of the Company and cash collateral received from either Counterparty, if any, is included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as cash collateral held at broker for forward currency contracts or cash collateral received from broker for forward currency contracts. The Company minimizes counterparty credit risk by only entering into agreements with counterparties that it believes to be of good standing and by monitoring the financial stability of those counterparties.
The following table is intended to provide additional information about the effect of the forward currency contracts on the consolidated financial statements of the Company including: the fair value of derivatives by risk category, the location of those fair values on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, and the Company’s gross and net amount of assets and liabilities available for offset under netting arrangements as well as any related collateral received or pledged by the Company as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.

Exclusion of the Investment Adviser from Commodity Pool Operator Definition
Engaging in commodity interest transactions such as swap transactions or futures contracts for the Company could cause the Investment Adviser to fall within the definition of “commodity pool operator” under the Commodity Exchange Act (the “CEA”) and related Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) regulations. The Investment Adviser has claimed an exclusion from the definition of the term “commodity pool operator” under the CEA and the CFTC regulations in connection with its management of the Company and, therefore, is not subject to CFTC registration or regulation under the CEA as a commodity pool operator with respect to its management of the Company.
Note 6. Fair Value Measurements 
The Company follows ASC Topic 820 for measuring fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters, or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices or inputs are not available, valuation models are applied. These valuation models involve some level of estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price 
243
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  
(In thousands, except shares and per share data)
transparency for the assets or liabilities or market and the assets’ or liabilities’ complexity. Effective August 2, 2024, the Board designated the Investment Adviser as the Company’s Valuation Designee in accordance with Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act. The Company’s fair value analysis, currently undertaken by the Valuation Designee, includes an analysis of the value of any unfunded loan commitments. Assets and liabilities are categorized for disclosure purposes based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their value. The valuation hierarchical levels are based upon the transparency of the inputs to the valuation of the asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows:
Level 1:
      Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.
Level 2:
      Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3:  
Inputs include significant unobservable inputs for the assets or liabilities and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the assets or liabilities. The inputs into the determination of fair value are based upon the best information available and require significant management judgment or estimation.
In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an asset’s or a liability’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. Currently, the Valuation Designee assesses the levels of assets and liabilities at each measurement date, and transfers between levels are recognized on the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfers. There were no transfers among Level 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities during the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The following section describes the valuation techniques used to measure different assets and liabilities at fair value and includes the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the assets and liabilities are categorized.
Investments
Level 1 investments are valued using quoted market prices. Level 2 investments are valued using market consensus prices that are corroborated by observable market data and quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities. Level 3 investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Valuation Designee, based on input of the Valuation Designee’s personnel and independent valuation firms that have been engaged at the direction of the Valuation Designee to assist in the valuation of each portfolio investment without a readily available market quotation at least every other quarter under a valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. This valuation process is conducted at the end of each fiscal quarter, with each portfolio investment being reviewed at least every other quarter (subject to a de minimis threshold) with approximately 50% (based on the fair value of the portfolio company investments) of the Company’s valuations of debt and equity investments without readily available market quotations subject to review by an independent valuation firm. All investments as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, with the exception of one portfolio company investment (Level 1 investments), were valued using Level 3 inputs. As of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, all money market funds included in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents were valued using Level 1 inputs and all forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps were valued using Level 2 inputs.
When determining fair value of Level 3 debt and equity investments, the Valuation Designee takes into account the following factors, where relevant: the enterprise value of a portfolio company, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company’s ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons to publicly traded securities, and changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets generally that affect the price at which similar investments are made and other relevant factors. The primary method for determining enterprise value uses a multiple analysis whereby appropriate multiples are applied to the portfolio company’s net income before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”). A portfolio company’s EBITDA can include pro forma 
244
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Golub Capital BDC, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  
(In thousands, except shares and per share data)
adjustments for items such as acquisitions, divestitures, or expense reductions. The enterprise value analysis is performed to determine the value of equity investments and to determine if debt investments are credit impaired. If debt investments are credit impaired, the Valuation Designee will use the enterprise value analysis or a liquidation basis analysis to determine fair value. For debt investments that are not determined to be credit impaired, the Valuation Designee uses a market interest rate yield analysis to determine fair value.
In addition, for certain debt investments, the Valuation Designee bases its valuation on indicative bid and ask prices provided by an independent third party pricing service. Bid prices reflect the highest price that the Company and others could be willing to pay. Ask prices represent the lowest price that the Company and others could be willing to accept. The Valuation Designee generally uses the midpoint of the bid/ask range as its best estimate of fair value of such investment.
Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of Level 3 investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments could differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and could differ materially from the values that are ultimately received or settled. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded instruments. If the Company were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, the Company could realize significantly less than the value at which such investment had previously been recorded. The Company’s investments are subject to market risk. Market risk is the potential for changes in the value due to market changes. Market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the investments are traded.
The following tables present fair value measurements of the Company’s investments and indicate the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized to determine such fair value as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023:

The above tables are not intended to be all-inclusive but rather to provide information on significant unobservable inputs and valuation techniques used by the Valuation Designee.
The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company’s debt and equity investments are EBITDA multiples, revenue multiples and market interest rates. The Valuation Designee uses EBITDA multiples and, to a lesser extent, revenue multiples on the Company’s debt and equity investments to determine any credit gains or losses. Increases or decreases in either of these inputs in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement. The Valuation Designee uses market interest rates for loans to determine if the effective yield on a loan is commensurate with the market yields for that type of loan. If a loan’s effective yield was significantly less than the market yield for a similar loan with a similar credit profile, then the resulting fair value of the loan could have been lower.
Other Financial Assets and Liabilities
ASC Topic 820 requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments for which it is practical to estimate such value. As a result, with the exception of the line item titled “debt” which is reported at cost, all assets and liabilities approximate fair value on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition due to their short maturity. The fair value of the Company's 2024 Notes, 2026 Notes, 2027 Notes, 2028 Notes and 2029 Notes (as defined in Note 7. Borrowings) is based on vendor pricing received by the Company, which is considered a Level 2 input. The fair value of the Company’s remaining debt is estimated using Level 3 inputs by discounting remaining payments using comparable market rates or market quotes for similar instruments at the measurement date, if available.
The following are the carrying values and fair values of the Company’s debt as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.

Note 7. Borrowings

In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, prior to February 6, 2019, the Company was allowed to borrow amounts such that its asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, was at least 200% after such borrowing. On February 5, 2019, the Company’s stockholders voted to approve the asset coverage requirement decrease to 
150
% from 200% in accordance with Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act. Effective February 6, 2019, the reduced asset coverage requirement permits the Company to have a ratio of total consolidated assets to outstanding indebtedness of 2:1 as compared to a maximum of 1:1 under the 200% asset coverage requirement. As of September 30, 2024, the Company’s asset coverage for borrowed amounts was

 in aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes (the “
2028 Notes
”). As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Notes was $
450,000
. The 2028 Notes bear interest at a rate of 
7.050
% per year payable semi-annually in arrears on June 5 and December 5 of each year, commencing on June 5, 2024. The 2028 Notes mature on December 5, 2028.
The 2028 Notes are the Company’s general unsecured obligations that rank senior in right of payment to all of the Company’s future indebtedness or other obligations that are expressly subordinated, or junior, in right of payment to the 2028 Notes; equal in right of payment to the Company’s existing and future indebtedness or other obligations that are not so subordinated or junior; effectively junior to any of the Company’s secured indebtedness or other obligations (including unsecured indebtedness that the Company later secures) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations (including trade payables) incurred by the Company’s subsidiaries, financing vehicles or similar facilities.
At any time or from time to time, the Company could redeem some or all of the 2028 Notes at a redemption price equal to the greater of (1) 
100
% of the principal amount of the 2028 Notes to be redeemed or (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the redemption date on the 2028 Notes on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) using the applicable Treasury Rate plus 
45
 basis points less interest accrued to the date of redemption. If the Company redeems any 2028 Notes on or after November 5, 2028 (the date falling one month prior to the maturity date of the 2028 Notes), the redemption price for the 2028 Notes will be equal to 
100

Note 8. Federal Income Tax Matters 
The Company has elected to be treated and intends to be subject to tax as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a result, the Company must distribute substantially all of its net taxable income each tax year as dividends to its stockholders which will generally relieve the Company from U.S. federal income tax. 
Dividends from net investment income and distributions from net realized capital gains are determined in accordance with U.S. federal tax regulations, which could differ from amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and those differences could be material. These book-to-tax differences are either temporary or permanent in nature. Reclassifications due to permanent book-tax differences have no impact on net assets.
The following permanent differences were reclassified for tax purposes among the components of net assets for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022:

Taxable income generally differs from net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses and generally excludes unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investment transactions as investment gains and losses are not included in taxable income until they are realized. 
The following table reconciles net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations to taxable income for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022:

Capital losses in excess of capital gains earned in a tax year may generally be carried forward and used to offset capital gains, subject to certain limitations. Capital losses incurred by the Company in tax years beginning after September 30, 2011 are not subject to expiration and retain their character as either short-term or long-term capital losses. As of September 30, 2024, the Company estimates that it will have $
22,399
 of capital loss carryforward available for use in subsequent tax years.
For tax purposes, the Company may elect to defer any portion of a post-October capital loss or late-year ordinary loss to the first day of the following fiscal year. As of September 30, 2024, September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the Company did 
not
 elect to defer ordinary losses, short-term capital losses or long-term capital losses.
For the tax year ended September 30, 2024, the Company estimates taxable income in excess of the distributions made from such taxable income during the tax year, and therefore, the Company has elected to carry forward the excess for distribution to stockholders in the tax year ended September 30, 2025. The amount carried forward to the tax year ended September 30, 2025 is estimated to be approximately $
19,151
 of ordinary income, although these amounts will not be finalized until the September 30, 2024 tax returns are filed in 2025.
As of September 30, 2024, the federal tax cost of investments was $
8,379,659
 resulting in estimated gross unrealized gains and losses of $
193,847
 and $
338,095
, respectively. 
The Company has consolidated subsidiaries that are subject to U.S. federal and state corporate-level income taxes.  For the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded a net tax benefit for taxable subsidiaries of $
549
 and $
101
, respectively. For the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company recorded a tax expense for taxable subsidiaries of $
1,229
. As of September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a net deferred tax liability of $
780
 for taxable subsidiaries, which is included in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The deferred tax liability primarily resulted from unrealized appreciation on the investments held at the taxable subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2023, the Company recorded a net deferred tax liability of $
1,090
 for taxable subsidiaries, which is included in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The deferred tax liability primarily resulted from unrealized appreciation on the investments held at the taxable subsidiaries.

Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies

Commitments:  
As of September 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding commitments to fund investments totaling $
717,869
, including $
157,618
 of commitments on undrawn revolvers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding commitments to fund investments totaling $
189,378
, including $
39,650
 of commitments on undrawn revolvers. 
Indemnifications:
  In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties that provide general indemnifications. The Company’s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as these involve future claims against the Company that have not occurred. The Company expects the risk of any future obligations under these indemnifications to be remote.
Off-balance sheet risk:  
Off-balance sheet risk refers to an unrecorded potential liability that could result in a future obligation or loss, even though it does not appear on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The Company has entered and, in the future, could again enter into derivative instruments that contain elements of off-balance sheet market and credit risk. Refer to Note 5 for outstanding forward currency contracts and interest rate swap agreements as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. Derivative instruments can be affected by market conditions, such as interest rate and foreign currency volatility, which could impact the fair value of the derivative instruments. If market conditions move against the Company, it could not achieve the anticipated benefits of the derivative instruments and could realize a loss. The Company minimizes market risk through monitoring its investments and borrowings.
Concentration of credit and counterparty risk:
  Credit risk arises primarily from the potential inability of counterparties to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract. The Company has engaged and, in the future, may engage again in derivative transactions with counterparties. In the event that the counterparties do not fulfill their obligations, the Company could be exposed to risk. The risk of default depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparties or issuers of the instruments. The Company’s maximum loss that it could incur related to counterparty risk on its derivative instruments is the value of the collateral for that respective derivative instrument. It is the Company’s policy to review, as necessary, the credit standing of each counterparty.
Legal proceedings:
  In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to legal and regulatory proceedings that are generally incidental to its ongoing operations. While there can be no assurance of the ultimate disposition of any such proceedings, the Company does not believe any disposition will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Note 15. Acquisition of Golub Capital BDC 3, Inc.
On June 3, 2024, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of GBDC 3. In accordance with the terms of the GBDC 3 Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the GBDC 3 Merger, each outstanding share of GBDC 3 common stock was converted into the right to receive 
0.9138
 shares of common stock, par value $
0.001
 per share of the Company (with GBDC 3 stockholders receiving cash in lieu of fractional shares of the Company’s common stock). As a result of the GBDC 3 Merger, the Company issued an aggregate of 
92,115,308
 shares of its common stock to former GBDC 3 stockholders.
The GBDC 3 Merger was accounted for in accordance with the asset acquisition method of accounting as detailed in ASC Topic 805. The fair value of the merger consideration paid and transaction costs incurred to complete the GBDC 3 Merger by the Company was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their relative fair values as of the date of acquisition and did not give rise to goodwill. The excess of merger consideration paid over the fair value of net assets acquired is considered the purchase premium. Immediately following the acquisition of GBDC 3, the Company recorded its assets at their respective fair values and, as a result, the purchase premium allocated to the cost basis of the GBDC 3 assets acquired was immediately recognized as unrealized depreciation on the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations. The purchase premium allocated to investments in loan securities will amortize over the life of the loans through interest income with a corresponding reversal of the unrealized depreciation on the GBDC 3 loans acquired through their ultimate disposition. The purchase premium allocated to investments in equity securities, will not amortize over the life of the equity securities through interest income and, assuming no subsequent change to the fair value of the GBDC 3 equity securities acquired and disposition of such equity securities at fair value, the Company will recognize a realized loss or a reduction in realized gains with a corresponding reversal of the unrealized depreciation upon disposition of the GBDC 3 equity securities acquired.
The merger was considered a tax-free reorganization and the Company has elected to carry forward the historical cost basis of the GBDC 3 investments for tax purposes. 
The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as a result of the GBDC 3 Merger:
