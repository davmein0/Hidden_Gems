and growth opportunities. Our actual future fleet size and/or mix of aircraft types and future aircraft scheduled utilization will likely vary, and may vary materially, from our current fleet size and/or mix and aircraft utilization. The number of leased aircraft in the table above are aircraft we lease from our major airline partners for a de minimis monthly cost under capacity purchase agreements (also referred to as partner-financed aircraft).
Ground Facilities
We lease many of the buildings and associated land that we occupy. Most of these leases are for facilities at airports with various government agencies that control the use of the airport. We lease maintenance, training and office facilities in Salt Lake City, Utah, and we lease additional maintenance facilities in Boise, Idaho; Fresno, California; Tucson, Arizona; Chicago, Illinois; Detroit, Michigan; Nashville, Tennessee; South Bend, Indiana; and Fort Wayne, Indiana. We also lease ticket counters, passenger hold rooms, operating areas and other terminal space in many of the airports that we serve.
We own our corporate headquarters facilities located in St. George, Utah and a maintenance accessory shop facility in Salt Lake City, Utah. We also own maintenance facilities on land leases with airport authorities in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and Colorado Springs, Colorado.
