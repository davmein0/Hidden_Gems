Overview
We have the largest regional airline operation in the United States. As of December 31, 2024, we offered scheduled passenger and air freight service with approximately 2,190 total daily departures to destinations in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Our fleet of E175, CRJ900, CRJ700 and CRJ550 have a multiple-class seat configuration, whereas our CRJ200 have a single-class seat configuration. During 2022, we formed SWC, which offers on-demand charter services using CRJ200 aircraft in a 30-seat configuration. As of December 31, 2024, we had 624 total aircraft in our fleet, including 492 aircraft in scheduled service or under contract pursuant to our code-share agreements, summarized as follows:

As of December 31, 2024, other aircraft included: supplemental spare aircraft supporting our code-share agreements that may be placed under future code-share or leasing arrangements, aircraft transitioning between code-share agreements with our major airline partners or aircraft that are scheduled to be disassembled for use as spare parts.
Our business model is based on providing scheduled regional airline service under code-share agreements (commercial agreements between airlines that, among other things, allow one airline to use another airline’s flight designator codes on its flights) with our major airline partners. Our success is principally centered on our ability to meet the needs of our major airline partners by providing a reliable and safe operation at attractive economics. During the year 
32

Table of Contents
ended December 31, 2024, we made changes to our fleet, including the addition of five new E175 aircraft and 20 partner-financed E175 aircraft.
We anticipate our fleet will continue to evolve, as we are scheduled to add a total of 15 new E175 aircraft with United from 2025 to 2026 and one new E175 aircraft with Alaska in 2025. 
We also have multiple agreements with United to place 30 used CRJ550 aircraft into service throughout 2025 and 2026. 
Timing of placing these additional aircraft into service, including delivery timing on acquired aircraft, may be subject to change as we are coordinating with our major airline partners in response to labor availability or other factors. Our primary objective in the fleet changes is to improve our profitability by adding new E175 aircraft and used 
CRJ700, CRJ550, CRJ900 and E175 aircraft, commonly referred to as “
dual-class CRJ aircraft,” to capacity purchase agreements or prorate agreements, and potentially removing older aircraft from service that typically require higher maintenance costs.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, approximately 43.9% of our aircraft in scheduled service or under contract were operated for United, approximately 29.1% were operated for Delta, approximately 18.5% were operated for American and approximately 8.5% were operated for Alaska.
Historically, multiple contractual relationships with major airlines have enabled us to reduce our reliance on any single major airline code and to enhance and stabilize operating results through a mix of our capacity purchase agreements and our prorate flying agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2024, our capacity purchase revenue represented approximately 86.6% of our total flying agreements revenue and our prorate and SWC revenue, combined, represented approximately 13.4% of our total flying agreements revenue. On capacity purchase routes, the major airline partner controls scheduling, ticketing, pricing and seat inventories and we are compensated by the major airline partner at contracted rates based on completed block hours (measured from takeoff to landing, including taxi time), flight departures, the number of aircraft under contract and other operating measures. We control scheduling, pricing and seat inventories on certain prorate routes, and we share passenger fares with our major airline partners according to prorate formulas. We are also responsible for the operating costs of the prorate flights, including fuel and airport costs.
Financial Highlights
We had total operating revenues of $3.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, a 20.2% increase compared to total operating revenues of $2.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. We had net income of $323.0 million, or $7.77 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to net income of $34.3 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2023. The significant items affecting our revenue and operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2024, are outlined below:
Revenue
The number of aircraft we have in scheduled service or under contract pursuant to our code-share agreements and the number of block hours we incur on our flights are primary drivers of our flying agreements revenue under our capacity purchase agreements. The number of flights we operate and the corresponding number of passengers we carry are the primary drivers of our revenue under our prorate flying agreements. The number of aircraft we have in scheduled service or under contract pursuant to our code-share agreements increased from 485 as of December 31, 2023, to 492 as of December 31, 2024, or by 1.4%; and the number of block hours increased from 1.14 million in 2023 to 1.29 million in 2024, or by 13.3%,
 due to an increase in scheduled daily utilization of our aircraft driven by an increase in the number of available captains.
Our capacity purchase revenue increased $502.4 million, or 20.5%, from 2023 to 2024, primarily as a result of an increase in completed block hours for the comparable period and recognizing previously deferred revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to deferring the recognition of revenue on fixed monthly payments we received during the year ended December 31, 2023. As a result of a higher number of passengers carried on our prorate routes and an increase in the number of prorate and charter flights operated year-over-year, our prorate and SWC revenue increased $76.0 million, or 19.9%, in 2024, as compared to 2023.
Operating Expenses 
Our total operating expenses increased $201.9 million, or 7.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to an increase 
in 
33

Table of Contents
our direct operating expenses associated with the increase in the number of flights we operated
 for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. 
Departures increased from 691,962 for the year ended December 31, 2023 to 766,742 for the year ended December 31, 2024, or by 10.8%, and our total block hours increased 13.3% in 2024, as compared to 2023. 
Additional details regarding the increase in our operating expenses are described in the section of this Report entitled “Results of Operations.”

During 2024, we took delivery of five new E175 aircraft and placed the aircraft into service under capacity purchase agreements and we placed 20 partner-financed E175 aircraft into service under a capacity purchase agreement. We placed 23 SkyWest owned CRJ550 aircraft into service under a capacity purchase agreement or prorate agreement, while removing 22 CRJ700 aircraft from flying agreements. We also removed 14 CRJ200 aircraft from service during 2024. We are 
evaluating alternative uses for the CRJ200 aircraft removed from service.

The increase in “Capacity purchase agreements flight operations revenue” of $438.9 million, or 22.2%, 
was primarily due to a 13.3% increase in block hour production and a decrease in deferred revenue related to fixed monthly payments for flight 
operations received under our capacity purchase agreements for the
 year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. Under our capacity purchase agreements, we are paid a fixed amount per month per aircraft over the contract term. We recognize the total projected fixed monthly payments per aircraft as revenue proportionately to the number of block hours we complete for each reporting period, relative to the estimated number of block hours we anticipate completing over the remaining contract term. Under our capacity purchase agreements, the performance obligation of each completed flight is measured in block hours incurred for each completed flight. Beginning January 1, 2024, certain scheduled fixed monthly payments under our capacity purchase agreements transitioned to variable payments, which was the primary driver in recognizing previously deferred revenue during the year ended December 31, 2024, whereas we deferred recognizing revenue associated with the fixed monthly payments for the year ended December 31, 2023. Based on the number of completed block hours during the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized $43.4 million of previously deferred revenue, net of unbilled revenue, related to the non-lease fixed monthly payments we received associated with our flight operations revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we deferred recognizing $164.0 million of revenue, net of unbilled revenue, related to the non-lease fixed monthly payments received associated with our flight operations revenues. The timing of our revenue recognition related to the fixed payments associated with our flight operations will be adjusted over the remaining contract term for each capacity purchase agreement based on the number of block hours we complete each reporting period relative to the number of block hours we anticipate completing over the remaining contract term of each capacity purchase agreement.
The increase in “Capacity purchase agreements aircraft lease revenue” of $63.5 million, or 13.3%, was primarily due to a transition from certain scheduled fixed monthly lease payments to variable lease payments under our capacity purchase agreements beginning January 1, 2024. Under our capacity purchase agreements, a portion of the consideration we are paid is designed as reimbursement for certain aircraft ownership costs and is considered lease revenue, including fixed monthly payments and variable payments. We recognize the fixed monthly lease payments as lease revenue using the straight-line basis over the capacity purchase agreement term and variable lease payments are recognized in the period when the block hours are completed. We recognized $1.5 million of previously deferred lease revenue during the year ended December 31, 2024, using the straight-line basis for fixed monthly lease payments, whereas we deferred recognizing $78.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2023.
The deferred revenue balance applicable to each contract will be recorded as revenue over the term of each respective contract. 
For clarity, under our “Capacity purchase agreements flight operations revenue” and “Capacity purchase agreements aircraft lease revenue” combined, we recognized $44.9 million of previously deferred revenue, net of unbilled revenue, during the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to deferring revenue, net of unbilled revenue, of $242.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. 
Our total deferred revenue balance, associated with our “Capacity purchase agreements flight operations revenue” and our “Capacity purchase agreements aircraft lease revenue,” net of unbilled revenue, was $322.4 million as of December 31, 2024, compared to total deferred revenue, net of unbilled revenue of $367.3 million as of December 31, 2023. 
The increase in prorate agreements and SWC revenue of $76.0 million, or 19.9%, was 
primarily due to 
an increase in prorate passengers and passenger revenue we received on routes we operated under our prorate agreements during the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.
 Additionally, a portion of 
35

Table of Contents
the increase was attributed to an increase in SWC revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, as SWC began operations in 2023.
The increase in lease, airport services and other revenues of $14.1 million, or 13.9%, 
was primarily due to an incr
ease in the number of leased assets and lease rates for leases to third parties during 2024 compared to 2023.

​
Salaries, wages and benefits. 
 The $141.3 million, or 10.7%, increase in salaries, wages and benefits was due to
 an increase in 
direct labor costs that resulted from the higher number of flights we operated during
 the
 year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. 
Aircraft maintenance, materials and repairs.

The $39.2 million, or 5.8%, increase in aircraft maintenance expense was
 primarily due to
 h
igher flight volume, which increased our maintenance activity and related expenses,
 for the 
year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.

Depreciation and amortization. 
 The $0.8 million, or 0.2%, increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense related to the acquisition of five new E175 aircraft and spare engines since December 31, 2023, significantly offset by lower depreciation on our older CRJ fleet that reached our previously estimated useful life estimates during the 2024 year.
Aircraft fuel.

The $1.5 million, or 1.7%, increase in fuel cost was primarily due to an increase in the number of flights we operated under our prorate agreements and under SWC and the corresponding increase in gallons of fuel we purchased, offset by a decrease in our average fuel cost per gallon from $3.70 in 2023 to $3.19 in 2024.

We purchase and incur expense for all fuel on flights operated under our prorate agreements and SWC. All fuel costs incurred under our capacity purchase agreements are either purchased directly by our major airline partner, or if purchased by us, we record the direct reimbursement as a reduction to our fuel expense. The following table summarizes the gallons of fuel we purchased under our prorate agreements and SWC, for the periods indicated:

Airport-related expenses
.

Airport-related expenses include airport-related customer service costs such as outsourced airport gate and ramp agent services, airport security fees, passenger interruption costs, deicing, landing fees and station rents. For clarity, our employee airport customer service labor costs are reflected in salaries, wages and benefits and customer service labor costs we outsource to third parties are included in airport-related expenses. The $13.2 million, or 18.2%, increase in airport-related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, 
was primarily 
due to an increase in subcontracted airport services, weather related aircraft deicing costs and landing fees as a result of an increase in the number of flights we operated under our prorate agreements.
36

Table of Contents
Aircraft rentals.  
The $20.3 million, or 79.4%, decrease in aircraft rentals was primarily related to early lease buyouts we executed during 2023
. During 2023,
 we acquired 26 CRJ700 aircraft, eight CRJ200 aircraft and one CRJ900 aircraft under early lease buyouts.
Other operating expenses.

Other operating expenses primarily consist of property taxes, hull and liability insurance, simulator costs, crew per diem, crew hotel costs and credit loss reserves. The $26.2 million, or 9.8%, increase in other operating expenses 
was primarily related to an increase in other operating costs, such as crew per diem and crew hotel costs, as a result of the higher number of flights we operated during 2024, compared to 2023.
Summary of interest expense, interest income, other income (expense) and provision for income taxes:
Interest Expense.

The $16.6 million, or 12.7%, decrease in interest expense was primarily related to a decrease in outstanding debt from $3.0 billion at December 31, 2023 to $2.7 billion at December 31, 2024. Our average effective interest rate for 2024 and 2023 was 4.2% and 4.1%, respectively.
Interest income.
  Interest income increased $4.0 million, from $43.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 to $47.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2024. Our interest income increased primarily from an increase in 
average interest rates attributed to our marketable securities for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.
Other income, net.
 Other income, net decreased $19.4 million in 2024, compared to 2023. Other income, net primarily consists of the realized and unrealized gains or losses on our investments in other companies, income or loss related to our equity method investments and gains or losses on the sale of assets. The decrease in other income, net was primarily due to a decrease in gains from the sale of assets and a decrease in unrealized gains on our investments in other companies for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.
Provision for income taxes.
 For the years ended December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, our effective income tax rates were 25.3% and 14.8%, respectively, which included the statutory federal income tax rate of 21% and other reconciling income tax items, including state income taxes and the impact of non-deductible expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the lower effective tax rate was primarily related to a benefit of $7.6 million for the release of a previously recorded uncertain tax position liability. Our income tax provision rate may fluctuate each reporting period based on various factors including, but not limited to, the amount of our non-deductible operating expenses, relative to our income before income taxes.
Net Inc
ome.
  Primarily due to the factors described above, we generated net income of $323.0 million, or $7.77 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to net income of $34.3 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2023.
Our Business Segments 2024 compared to 2023
:
Our reporting segments consist of (1) the operations of SkyWest Airlines and SWC, which had its first revenue generating flight in 2023, (collectively, “SkyWest Airlines and SWC”) and (2) SkyWest Leasing activities.
Our chief operating decision maker analyzes the profitability of operating aircraft under our code-share agreements separately from the profitability of financing new aircraft acquired through debt and cash placed under our capacity purchase agreements, currently consisting of our E175 fleet, and our return on such aircraft financing. The SkyWest Airlines and SWC segment includes revenue earned under the applicable capacity purchase agreements attributed to operating such aircraft and the respective operating costs, and revenue and operating expenses attributed to other flying or airport services agreements and charter flight services. The SkyWest Leasing segment includes applicable revenue earned under the applicable capacity purchase agreements attributed to the ownership of new aircraft acquired through the issuance of debt and the respective depreciation and interest expense of such aircraft. The SkyWest Leasing segment also includes the activity of acquiring and leasing used regional jet aircraft and spare engines to third parties and other activities. The SkyWest Leasing segment’s total assets and capital expenditures include new aircraft acquired through the issuance of debt and our aircraft and engines leased to third parties. Additionally, aircraft removed from SkyWest Airlines operations and held for sale are included in the SkyWest Leasing segment.

SkyWest Airlines and SWC Segment Profit (Loss).
  SkyWest Airlines and SWC segment profit was $138.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to a segment loss of $165.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.
SkyWest Airlines and SWC block hour production increased 13.3%, from 1,140,443 for the year ended December 31, 2023 to 1,292,040 for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily due to an increase in the number of available captains, which allowed for a higher scheduled utilization of our aircraft. Significant items contributing to the SkyWest Airlines and SWC segment profit for the year ended December 31, 2024 are set forth below.
SkyWest Airlines and SWC operating revenues increased $513.2 million, or 21.5%, from 2024 to 2023. SkyWest Airlines recognizes 
revenue attributed to flight operations received as fixed monthly payments per aircraft proportionate to the number of block hours completed during each reporting period, relative to the estimated number of block hours we anticipate completing over the remaining contract term. 
During the year ended December 31, 2024, SkyWest Airlines recognized $43.4 million of previously deferred revenue, net of unbilled revenue, related to fixed monthly payments we received associated with our flight operations revenues, compared to deferring $164.0 million of revenue, net of unbilled revenue, related to fixed monthly payments received associated with our flight operations revenues during the year ended December 31, 2023. 
Additionally, the increase in SkyWest Airlines and SWC operating revenues was attributed to an increase in block hour production during the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.
SkyWest Airlines and SWC’s salaries, wages and benefits expense increased $141.3 million, or 10.7%, primarily due to an increase in direct labor costs that resulted from the higher number of flights we operated during the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.
SkyWest Airlines and SWC’s aircraft maintenance, materials and repairs expense increased $27.4 million, or 4.2%, primarily due to higher flight volume, which increased the maintenance activity and related expenses, for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.
38

Table of Contents
SkyWest Airlines and SWC’s depreciation and amortization expense decreased $4.2 million, or 2.8%, primarily due to lower depreciation on our older CRJ fleet that reached our previously estimated useful life estimates during the 2024 year.
SkyWest Airlines and SWC’s interest expense decreased $4.1 million, or 24.3%, primarily due a decrease in outstanding debt from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024.
SkyWest Airlines and SWC’s other segment items increased $48.7 million, or 11.8%, primarily related to 
an increase in other operating costs, such as crew per diem and crew hotel costs, as a result of the higher number of flights we operated during the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, offset by a decrease in aircraft rent expense due to the early lease buyouts of 35 CRJ aircraft in 2023.

SkyWest Leasing Segment Profit.
  SkyWest Leasing profit increased $87.7 million, or 42.7%, during 2024, compared to 2023. 
For the year ended December 31, 2024, SkyWest Leasing recognized $1.5 million of previously deferred lease revenue, compared to deferring $78.5 million of lease revenue on the fixed monthly lease payments received for the year ended December 31, 2023, under the straight-line basis. Additionally, SkyWest Leasing profit increased due to additional lease revenue from the E175 aircraft placed under contract since December 31, 2023, a decrease in interest expense as a result of a lower outstanding debt balance for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, and a gain related to reclassifying assets held for sale as held and used during the year ended December 31, 2024.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2024, we had $801.6 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and $75.1 million available for borrowings under our line of credit. Given our available liquidity as of December 31, 2024, we believe the working capital currently available to us will be sufficient to meet our present financial requirements, including planned capital expenditures, scheduled lease payments and debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months. 
Our total of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased from $835.2 million as of December 31, 2023, to $801.6 million as of December 31, 2024, or by $33.6 million. Our total long-term debt, including current maturities decreased from $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2023, to $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2024, or by $0.3 billion, primarily due to scheduled debt payments for the 2024 year, partially offset by debt issued to finance five new E175 aircraft. Additionally, we used $43.3 million to repurchase 0.6 million shares of our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2024. At December 31, 2024, our total capital mix (measured as a ratio of total stockholder equity 
39

Table of Contents
and total long-term debt, including current maturities) was 47.4% equity and 52.6% total long-term debt, compared to 41.3% equity and 58.7% total long-term debt at December 31, 2023.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $47.1 million and $49.1 million, respectively, in letters of credit and surety bonds outstanding with various banks and surety institutions. We had no restricted cash as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Cash Flows provided by Operating Activities
Our cash flows provided by operating activities was $692.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $736.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our operating cash flows are typically impacted by various factors including our net income, adjusted for non-cash expenses and gains such as depreciation expense, asset impairment charges, stock-based compensation expense and gains or losses on the disposal of assets; and timing of cash payments and cash receipts attributed to our various current asset and liability accounts, such as accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, deferred revenue and unbilled revenue. 
The decrease in our cash flow from operations for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, was primarily due to the timing of cash payments on our current liability accounts, timing of cash receipts on our accounts receivables and a decrease in cash received in excess of revenue recognized for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, offset by an increase in net income, adjusted for non-cash items and deferred income taxes, for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. 
Cash Flows used in Investing Activities
Our cash flows used in investing activities was $228.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $23.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our investing cash flows are typically impacted by various factors including our capital expenditures, such as the acquisition of aircraft and spare engines; deposit payments; purchase and sales of marketable securities; proceeds from the sale of assets; and timing of cash payments and cash receipts attributed to our various long-term asset and long-term liability accounts.
Excluding the purchase and sale of marketable securities, which results in the transfer of dollars between our investments in marketable securities and our cash accounts, our cash used in investing activities increased from $284.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, to $341.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. The increase in cash used in investing activities, excluding the transfer of dollars between our investments in marketable securities and our cash accounts, was primarily due to an increase of $59.4 million used in the acquisition of property and equipment for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to the acquisition of five new E175 aircraft in 2024. Additionally, there was an increase in our cash used to acquire other long-term assets, 
40

Table of Contents
including our investment in Contour, for the year ended December 31, 2024, offset by a decrease of $47.5 million in aircraft deposits in 2024, compared to 2023.
Cash Flows used in Financing Activities
Our cash flows used in financing activities was $384.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to cash used in financing activities of $667.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our financing cash flows are typically impacted by various factors including proceeds from issuance of debt, principal payments on debt obligations, repurchases of our common stock and payment of cash dividends.
The $283.1 million decrease in cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, w
as primarily due to a decrease of $248.6 million in cash used to purchase treasury stock and an increase of $46.5 million in proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, offset by an increase of $5.3 million in principal payments on long-term debt and an increase of $6.3 million for employee income taxes paid on vested equity awards during the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.

At December 31, 2024, all of our total long-term debt had fixed interest rates. 
In addition to the table above, in 2024, we entered into a master equipment purchase agreement with another airline to acquire certain airframes and engines and lease the assets back to the airline under a five-year term. At December 31, 2024, we estimate the remaining financing obligation under the agreement will be between $60.0 million and $70.0 million and anticipate closing on the remaining financings during 2025.
Purchase Commitments and Options
We are coordinating with our major airline partners and aircraft manufacturers on the timing of upcoming fleet deliveries under previously announced deals. The anticipated future aircraft delivery dates are subject to change. As of December 31, 2024, we had a firm purchase commitment for 16 new E175 aircraft from Embraer with delivery dates anticipated into 2026. 
 We also have a firm purchase commitment to purchase four used CRJ550 aircraft with anticipated delivery dates in 2025.
At the time of each aircraft acquisition, we evaluate the financing alternatives available to us, and select one or more of these methods to fund the acquisition. In recent years, we have issued long-term debt to finance our new aircraft. At present, we intend to fund our aircraft purchase commitments through a combination of cash on hand and debt financing. Based on current market conditions and discussions with prospective leasing organizations and financial institutions, we currently believe that we will be able to obtain financing for our committed acquisitions, as well as additional aircraft. We intend to finance the firm purchase commitment for 16 E175 aircraft with approximately 75-85% 
41

Table of Contents
debt and the remaining balance with cash. 
We intend to fund the purchase of the four used CRJ550 aircraft through cash on hand.
Aircraft Lease and Facility Obligations
We also have long-term lease obligations, primarily relating to our facilities, aircraft and engines. Excluding aircraft financed by our major airline partners that we operate for them under contract, we had eight aircraft under lease with remaining terms ranging from four to six years as of December 31, 2024. These eight leased aircraft are subleased to a third party. Future minimum lease payments due under all long-term operating leases were approximately $129.3 million at December 31, 2024. Assuming a 6.2% discount rate, which is the average incremental borrowing rate we anticipate we would have incurred on debt obtained over a similar term to acquire these assets, the present value of these lease obligations would have been equal to approximately $87.7 million at December 31, 2024.
Long-term Debt Obligations
As of December 31, 2024, we had $2.7 billion of long-term debt, which consisted of $2.5 billion of debt used to finance aircraft and spare engines and $200.6 million of unsecured debt payable to Treasury. The average effective interest rate on our debt obligations was approximately 4.2% at December 31, 2024.
Under our capacity purchase agreements, our major airline partners compensate us for our costs of owning the aircraft on a monthly basis. The aircraft compensation structure varies by agreement but is intended to cover either our aircraft principal and interest debt service costs, our aircraft depreciation and interest expense or our aircraft lease expense costs while the aircraft is under contract.
Guarantees
We have guaranteed the obligations of SkyWest Airlines under the Delta Connection Agreement and the United Express Agreement for the E175 aircraft. In addition, we have guaranteed certain other obligations under our aircraft financing and leasing agreements.
We have guaranteed $24.7 million in promissory notes of third parties in event the third parties default on their payments. The third parties’ loans are secured by aircraft and engines.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Critical accounting policies are those policies that are most important to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and require management’s subjective and complex judgments due to the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, long-lived assets and income tax as discussed below. The application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results will likely differ, and could differ materially, from such estimates.
Revenue Recognition
Flying agreements and airport customer service and other revenues are recognized when service is provided. Under our capacity purchase and prorate flying agreements with our major airline partners, our performance obligation is determined on a per completed flight basis. Under our capacity purchase agreements, the performance obligation of each completed flight is measured using block hours incurred for each completed flight, which factors the duration of each flight. Under our airport customer service agreements, our performance obligation is measured on a per departure basis for each flight we provide customer service. 
A portion of our compensation under our capacity purchase agreements is designed to reimburse us for the use of the aircraft we provide under such agreements. This compensation is deemed to be lease revenue, because the agreements identify the “right of use” or a specific type and number of aircraft over the agreement term. We allocate the total consideration received under our capacity purchase agreements between the lease and non-lease components based on stand-alone selling prices. A portion of the consideration received for the use of the aircraft is a fixed monthly payment per aircraft. We recognize the fixed monthly lease payments as lease revenue using the straight-line basis over 
42

Table of Contents
the capacity purchase agreement term and variable lease payments in the period when the block hours are completed. We recognized $1.5 million of previously deferred lease revenue during the year ended December 31, 2024, under the straight-line basis.
Additionally, a portion of our compensation under our capacity purchase agreements relates to operating the aircraft, identified as the non-lease component of the capacity purchase agreement. We recognize revenue attributed to the non-lease component received as fixed monthly payments per aircraft proportionate to the number of block hours completed during each reporting period, relative to the estimated number of block hours we anticipate completing over the remaining contract term. In 2024, we recognized $35.5 million of previously deferred fixed monthly payments and unbilled revenue increased $7.9 million. The amount of deferred revenue and unbilled revenue from fixed monthly payments we recognize will increase or decrease in future reporting periods depending on the number of block hours we complete during such reporting period and our then-current forecast of block hours we anticipate completing over the remaining contract term based on information available to us as that time.
Our revenues could be impacted by several factors, such as our flight schedules, passenger fares we receive under our prorate agreements, terminations, extensions or other amendments to our code-share agreements, our estimates used to determine the amount of revenue we defer under our capacity purchase agreements, and our ability to earn incentive payments contemplated under applicable agreements. In the event contracted rates are not finalized at a quarterly or annual financial statement date, we record that period’s revenues based on the lower of the prior period’s approved rates or our estimate of rates that will be implemented upon completion of negotiations. Also, in the event we have a reimbursement dispute with a major airline partner at a quarterly or annual financial statement date, we evaluate the dispute under established revenue recognition criteria and, provided the revenue recognition criteria have been met, we recognize revenue for that period based on our estimate of the resolution of the dispute. Our rates were finalized under our code-share agreements as of December 31, 2024.
Long-Lived Assets
As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $5.6 billion of property and equipment and related assets net of accumulated depreciation. In accounting for these long-lived assets, we make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets, the expected residual values of certain of these assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate. Factors indicating potential impairment include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of the long-lived assets, a significant change in the condition of the long-lived assets and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the long-lived assets. When considering whether or not impairment of long-lived assets exists, we group similar assets together at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and compare the undiscounted cash flows for each asset group to the net carrying amount of the assets supporting the asset group. Asset groupings are done at the fleet type or contract level. 
During 2023, we recorded a non-cash impairment loss of $2.3 million related to a change in the estimate of fair value for 14 CRJ700 aircraft that were classified as held for sale in 2022. We 
presented the $54.3 million of assets held for sale at the lower of their current carrying value or their fair market value less costs to sell and included the amount in “Other current assets” on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. In March 2024, we decided not to sell the 14 CRJ700 aircraft based on improved pilot availability and reclassified the aircraft as held for use assets in “Aircraft and rotable spares” on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. 
We remeasured the fair value of the held for use assets at the time of the reclassification and, 
as a result, we recorded a $4.2 million gain (pre-tax) for the year ended December 31, 2024, 
as an offset to “Other Operating Expenses” in our consolidated statement of income,
 primarily due to the elimination of the estimated costs to sell the assets. The fair values were based upon observable and unobservable inputs, including market trends and conditions. The gain of $4.2 million is included in “Other operating expenses” on the Company’s consolidated statements of comprehensive income and in the SkyWest Leasing segment for the year ended December 31, 2024. The impairment of $2.3 million is included in “Other operating expenses” on the Company’s consolidated statements of comprehensive income and in the SkyWest Leasing segment for the year ended December 31, 2023.
Factors that may impact our estimates used for depreciation include anticipated useful lives of each aircraft type and estimated residual values of each aircraft. As we operate our aircraft under code-share agreements with our major 
43

Table of Contents
airline partners, changes in anticipated demand by our major airline partners for regional aircraft may impact our estimated useful lives and residual values for our aircraft, spare engines and other long-lived assets.
Income Tax
Deferred income taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Estimating our tax liabilities involves judgments related to uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We make certain estimates and judgments to determine tax expense for financial statement purposes as we evaluate the effect of tax credits, tax benefits and deductions, some of which result from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue or expense for tax and financial statement purposes. Changes to these estimates may result in significant changes to our tax provision in future periods. Each fiscal quarter we re-evaluate our tax provision and reconsider our estimates and assumptions related to specific tax assets and liabilities, making adjustments as circumstances change.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for a description of recent accounting pronouncements.
ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Aircraft Fuel
In the past, we have not experienced sustained material difficulties with fuel availability, and we currently expect to be able to obtain fuel at prevailing prices in quantities sufficient to meet our future needs. Pursuant to our contract flying agreements, United, Delta, American and Alaska have agreed to bear the economic risk of fuel price fluctuations on our contracted flights. We bear the economic risk of fuel price fluctuations on our prorate and SWC operations. For each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, approximately 13%, 13% and 12% of our total flying agreements revenue was derived from prorate agreements and SWC. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the average price per gallon of aircraft fuel was $3.19, $3.70 and $4.14, respectively. For illustrative purposes only, we have estimated the impact of the market risk of fuel price fluctuations on our prorate and SWC operations using a hypothetical increase of 25% in the price per gallon we purchase. Based on this hypothetical assumption, we would have incurred an additional $21.9 million, $21.5 million and $27.1 million in fuel expense for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Interest Rates
As of December 31, 2024, our long-term debt had fixed interest rates. We currently intend to finance the acquisition of aircraft through long-term debt. Changes in interest rates may impact our actual cost to acquire future aircraft. To the extent we place new aircraft in service under our capacity purchase agreements with United, Delta, American, Alaska or other carriers, our capacity purchase agreements currently provide that reimbursement rates will be adjusted to reflect the interest rates effective at the closing of the respective aircraft financing. As such, a hypothetical 50 basis point change in market interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results. 
Labor and Inflation Risk
The global economy has experienced, and continues to experience high rates of inflation. We cannot predict how long these inflationary pressures will continue, or how they may change over time, but we expect to see continued impacts on the global economy and our Company.
As a result, our costs have become, and we expect they will continue to be, subject to inflationary pressures, and we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases under our capacity purchase agreements. Salaries, wages and benefits expense represented 48.3% of our total operating expense for year ended December 31, 2024. For illustrative purposes, a hypothetical increase of 25% to our salaries, wages and benefits during the year ended December 31, 2024, would have increased our operating expenses by approximately $366.0 million.

Our inability or failure to offset a material increase in costs due to inflation and/or labor costs could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Additionally, in the event we are unable to hire and retain qualified pilots or other operational personnel, including flight attendants and maintenance technicians, we may be unable to operate requested flight schedules under our capacity purchase agreements, which could result in a reduction in revenue and operating inefficiencies, such as incremental new-hire training costs, and could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. 
ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of SkyWest, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of SkyWest, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2 (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 13, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Calculation of deferred revenue
Description of the Matter
At December 31, 2024, the Company’s deferred revenue balance totaled $337.5 million, of which $54.8 million was presented as a component of other current liabilities and $282.7 million was included in other long-term liabilities on the balance sheet. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, under the Company’s capacity purchase agreements, the Company is paid a fixed amount per aircraft each month over the contract term. The Company recognizes revenue related to the fixed amount per aircraft each month based upon completed block hours proportionate to total forecasted block hours over the remaining contract term. To calculate the amount of revenue 
46

Table of Contents
to be recognized, the Company estimates revenue per block hour using historical data and forecasted block hour activity. 

​
Auditing the forecasted block hours over the remaining term of the contract, which is the primary input used in the deferred revenue calculation, required extensive audit effort due to the estimation uncertainty of the forecasted block hours over the remaining contract term. 
​
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of management’s controls over recognition and deferral of revenue related to block hours flown. This included controls over the forecasting process used to develop the estimated future block hours used in the calculation. We also tested controls over management’s review of the data used in the deferred revenue calculation.

​
To test the Company’s deferred revenue liability, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the methodology and assumptions used by the Company in the deferred revenue calculation, including testing of the forecasted block hours and validating completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by the Company. Specifically, we compared management’s forecasted block hours to historical flight activity and existing flight schedules with partner airlines. We evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast flight activity by performing hindsight analyses comparing actual historical results to past forecasts. We also performed sensitivity analyses to understand the impact of fluctuations in forecasted block hours to the deferred revenue liability.

Table of Contents
In preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company has reviewed, as determined necessary by the Company’s management, events that have occurred after December 31, 2024, through the filing date of the Company’s annual report with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates and assumptions.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company had 
no
 restricted cash as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Marketable Securities
The Company’s investments in debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair market value with the net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity. At the time of sale, any realized appreciation or depreciation, calculated by the specific identification method, is recognized in other income and expense. The Company’s position in marketable securities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was as follows (in thousands):

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had classified $
574.3
 million and $
686.9
 million of marketable securities, respectively, as short-term because it had the intent to maintain a liquid portfolio and the ability to redeem the securities within 
one year
.  
Inventories
Inventories include expendable parts, fuel and supplies and are valued at cost (FIFO basis) less an allowance for obsolescence based on historical part turnover, excess parts and management’s expectations of future operations. Expendable inventory parts are charged to expense as used. An obsolescence allowance for flight equipment expendable parts is accrued based on estimated lives of the corresponding fleet types, anticipated part usage and salvage values. The inventory allowance as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, was $
28.8
 million and $
26.1
 million, respectively.

Table of Contents
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over their useful lives to their estimated residual values using the straight-line basis. The Company revises its estimated useful life and residual values assumptions when facts and circumstances occur, particularly as the Company’s CRJ fleet ages. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company extended the CRJ700 contract with American and entered into agreements with United to place 
40
 CRJ550s under contract. As a result, the Company extended the estimated useful lives of its CRJ700/CRJ550 fleet an average of 
three years
 and revised the residual values of the assets accordingly. This resulted in a $
3.0
 million decrease in depreciation expense for the month ended December 31, 2024. The decrease in depreciation related to these CRJ assets is expected to be significantly offset in 2025 by any depreciation expense from new investments in capital expenditures, including the 
eight
 E175 aircraft the Company anticipates taking delivery of throughout 2025. The following summarizes the Company’s useful life and residual value assumptions as of December 31, 2024:

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately $
5.6
 billion of property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation. In accounting for these long-lived assets, the Company makes estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets, the expected residual values of such assets, and the potential for impairment based on projected future cash flows and estimated fair value of the assets. Factors indicating potential impairment include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of the long-lived assets, a significant change in the condition of the long-lived assets and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the long-lived assets. On a periodic basis, the Company evaluates whether impairment indicators are present. When considering whether or not impairment of long-lived assets exists, the Company groups similar assets together at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and compare the undiscounted cash flows for each asset group to the net carrying amount of the assets supporting the asset group. Asset groupings are done at the aircraft type level.
Capitalized Interest
Interest is capitalized on aircraft purchase deposits as a portion of the cost of the asset and is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company capitalized interest costs of approximately $
3.3
 million, $
1.5
 million and $
1.9
 million, respectively.
Maintenance
The Company operates under a U.S. Federal Aviation Administration approved continuous inspection and maintenance program. The Company uses the direct expense method of accounting for its regional jet engine overhauls. The Company has engine services agreements with third-party vendors to provide long-term engine services covering the scheduled and unscheduled repairs for most of its aircraft. Under the terms of the agreements, the Company pays a fixed dollar amount per engine hour flown per month and the third-party vendors will assume the responsibility to repair the engines at no additional cost to the Company, subject to certain specified exclusions. Maintenance costs under these contracts are recognized when the engine hour is flown pursuant to the terms of each contract. The repair costs for engines not covered by these hourly service agreements are expensed when repair services are incurred. The costs of maintenance for airframe and avionics components, landing gear and other recurring maintenance are expensed as incurred. 
Flying Agreements and Airport Customer Service and Other Revenues
The Company recognizes revenue under its flying agreements and under its lease, airport services and other service agreements when the service is provided under the applicable agreement. Under the Company’s capacity 
56

Table of Contents
purchase agreements with United, Delta, American and Alaska (each, a “major airline partner”), the major airline partner generally pays the Company a fixed-fee for each departure, flight hour (measured from takeoff to landing, excluding taxi time) or block hour (measured from takeoff to landing, including taxi time) incurred, and an amount per aircraft in service each month, with additional incentives based on flight completion, on-time performance or other performance metrics. The major airline partner also directly pays for or reimburses the Company for certain direct expenses incurred under the capacity purchase agreement, such as fuel, airport landing fees and airport rents. Under the capacity purchase agreements, the Company’s performance obligation is met when each flight is completed, measured in completed block hours, and is reflected in flying agreements revenue. The transaction price for the capacity purchase agreements is determined from the fixed-fee consideration, incentive consideration and directly reimbursed expenses earned as flights are completed over the agreement term. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, capacity purchase agreements represented approximately 
86.6
%, 
86.5
% and 
88.0
% of the Company’s flying agreements revenue, respectively.
Under the Company’s prorate agreements, the major airline partner and the Company negotiate a passenger fare proration formula, pursuant to which the Company receives a percentage of the ticket revenues for those passengers traveling for one portion of their trip on a Company airline and the other portion of their trip on the major airline partner. Under the Company’s prorate flying agreements, the performance obligation is met and revenue is recognized when each flight is completed based upon the portion of the prorate passenger fare the Company determines that it will receive for each completed flight. The transaction price for the prorate agreements is determined from the proration formula derived from each passenger ticket amount on each completed flight over the agreement term. Certain routes under the Company’s prorate agreements are subsidized by the U.S. Department of Transportation under the Essential Air Service (“EAS”) program, a program created to ensure small communities in the United States maintain a minimum level of scheduled air service. The EAS contracts are generally 
between two
 to 
three years
 in duration and the Company recognizes EAS revenue on a per-completed-flight basis pursuant to the terms of each contract. In the event the Company receives upfront consideration for an EAS contract, the Company recognizes the revenue on a per-completed flight basis over the EAS contract term. Under the Company’s charter operations, SWC, the Company negotiates a fare for the charter flight with the customer. The performance obligation is met and revenue is recognized upon completion of the flight. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, prorate flying agreements and SWC revenue represented approximately 
13.4
%, 
13.5
%, and 
12.0
% of the Company’s flying agreements revenue, respectively.

The Company allocates the total consideration received under its capacity purchase agreements between lease and non-lease components based on stand-alone selling prices. A portion of the Company’s compensation under its capacity purchase agreements relates to operating the aircraft, identified as the non-lease component of the capacity purchase agreement. The Company recognizes revenue attributed to the non-lease component received as fixed-fees for each departure, flight hour or block hour on an as-completed basis for each reporting period.
 The Company recognizes revenue attributed to the non-lease component received as fixed monthly payments per aircraft proportionate to the number of block hours completed during each reporting period, relative to the estimated number of block hours the Company anticipates completing over the remaining contract term. Accordingly, the Company’s revenue recognition will likely vary from the timing of cash receipts under the Company’s capacity purchase agreements. The Company refers to cash received under its capacity purchase agreements prior to recognizing revenue as “deferred revenue,” and the Company refers to revenue recognized prior to billing its major airline partners under its capacity purchase 
57

Table of Contents
agreements as “unbilled revenue” for each reporting period.
 In 2024, the Company recognized $
35.5
 million of previously deferred revenue associated with the non-lease fixed monthly payments under certain agreements and increased unbilled revenue by $
7.9
 million under certain other agreements, compared to deferring revenue of $
151.4
 million and decreasing unbilled revenue by $
12.6
 million in 2023, and deferring revenue of $
18.7
 million and recognizing $
11.5
 million of unbilled revenue in 2022.
A portion of the Company’s compensation under its capacity purchase agreements is designed to reimburse the Company for certain aircraft ownership costs. The consideration for aircraft ownership costs varies by agreement but is intended to cover either the Company’s aircraft principal and interest debt service costs, its aircraft depreciation and interest expense or its aircraft lease expense costs while the aircraft is under contract. The consideration received for the use of the aircraft under the Company’s capacity purchase agreements is accounted for as lease revenue, inasmuch as the agreements identify the “right of use” of a specific type and number of aircraft over a stated period of time. The lease revenue associated with the Company’s capacity purchase agreements is accounted for as an operating lease and is reflected as flying agreements revenue on the Company’s consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
 The Company recognizes fixed monthly lease payments as lease revenue using the straight-line basis over the capacity purchase agreement term and variable lease payments in the period when the block hours are completed. 
The Company recognized $
1.5
 million of previously deferred lease revenue during the year ended December 31, 2024, whereas the Company deferred recognizing lease revenue of $
78.5
 million and $
22.1
 million during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, for the fixed monthly lease payments under the straight-line basis. The Company has not separately stated aircraft rental income and aircraft rental expense in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income because the use of the aircraft is not a separate activity of the total service provided under the capacity purchase agreements.
The Company’s total deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2024, was $
337.5
 million, including $

The Company’s capacity purchase and prorate agreements include weekly provisional cash payments from the respective major airline partner based on a projected level of flying each month. The Company and each major airline partner subsequently reconcile these payments to the actual completed flight activity on a monthly or quarterly basis. 
In several of the Company’s agreements, the Company is eligible to receive incentive compensation upon the achievement of certain performance criteria. The incentives are defined in the agreements and are measured and determined on a monthly or annual basis. At the end of each period during the term of an agreement, the Company calculates the incentives achieved during that period and recognizes revenue attributable to that agreement accordingly, subject to the variable constraint guidance under Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606.
The following summarizes the significant provisions of each code-share agreement the Company has with each major airline partner through SkyWest Airlines:

The Company’s prorate agreements are based on specific routes, not a specific aircraft count. The number of aircraft listed above for each prorate agreement approximates the number of aircraft the Company uses to serve the prorate routes.
In addition to the contractual agreements described above, as of December 31, 2024, SkyWest Airlines reached agreements with certain major airline partners to place additional aircraft under capacity purchase agreements as summarized below. The Company is coordinating with its major airline partners to optimize the timing of upcoming fleet deliveries and the delivery timing referenced below is subject to change.
●
Capacity purchase agreement with United for 
15
 new E175 aircraft. 
Seven
 new E175 aircraft are currently scheduled for delivery in 2025 and 
eight
 new E175 aircraft are scheduled for delivery in 2026. The Company anticipates financing the aircraft through debt.
●
Capacity purchase agreement with Alaska for 
one
 new E175 aircraft. The delivery date for the new E175 aircraft is currently scheduled for 2025. The Company anticipates financing the aircraft through debt.
●
Capacity purchase agreement with United for 
30
 used CRJ550 aircraft. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company is in the process of acquiring 
four
 used CRJ550s and will convert 
26
 of its CRJ700s to CRJ550s. The aircraft are anticipated to be placed into service in 2025 through the end of 2026.
When an aircraft is scheduled for expiration from a capacity purchase agreement, the Company may, as practical under the circumstances, negotiate an extension with the respective major airline partner, negotiate the placement of the aircraft with another major airline partner, return the aircraft to the major airline partner when the aircraft is provided by the major airline partner, place owned aircraft for sale or pursue other uses for the aircraft. Other uses for the aircraft may include placing the aircraft in a prorate agreement, leasing the aircraft to a third party or disassembling aircraft components such as the engines and parts to be used as spare inventory.

Of the Company’s $
5.6
 billion of property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation as of December 31, 2024, $
202.3
 million of regional jet aircraft and spare engines were leased to third parties under operating leases. The Company’s mitigation strategy for the residual asset risks of these assets includes leasing aircraft and engine types that can be operated by the Company in the event of a default. Additionally, the operating leases typically have specified lease return condition requirements paid by the lessee to the Company and the Company typically maintains inspection rights under the leases. 
The transaction price for airport customer service agreements is determined from an agreed-upon rate by location applied to the applicable number of flights handled by the Company over the agreement term.
The Company’s operating revenues could be impacted by several factors, including changes to the Company’s code-share agreements with its major airline partners, changes in flight schedules, contract modifications resulting from contract renegotiations, the Company’s ability to earn incentive payments contemplated under the Company’s code-share agreements and settlement of reimbursement disputes with the Company’s major airline partners.
Other ancillary revenues commonly associated with airlines, such as baggage fee revenue, ticket change fee revenue and the marketing component of the sale of mileage credits, are retained by the Company’s major airline partners on flights that the Company operates under its code-share agreements.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $
122.8
 million in accounts receivable of which $
105.2
 million is related to flying agreements. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $
82.9
 million in accounts receivable of which $
73.6
 million is related to flying agreements.

The Company monitors publicly available credit ratings for entities for which the Company has a significant receivable balance or guarantee. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had gross receivables of $
125.9
 million in current assets and gross receivables of $
225.2
 million in other long-term assets. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had gross receivables of $
86.1

Income Taxes
The Company recognizes a net liability or asset for the deferred tax consequences of all temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements that are expected to result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled.
Net Income Per Common Share
Basic net income per common share (“Basic EPS”) excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per common share (“Diluted EPS”) reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. The computation of Diluted EPS does not assume exercise or conversion of securities that would have an anti-dilutive effect on net income per common share. 
Securities that could potentially dilute Basic EPS in the future, and which were excluded from the calculation of Diluted EPS because inclusion of such share would be anti-dilutive, are as follows (in thousands):

Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income includes charges and credits to stockholders’ equity that are not the result of transactions with the Company’s shareholders, including changes in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on marketable debt securities. 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for receivables and accounts payable approximate fair values because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments. Marketable securities are reported at fair value based on market quoted prices in the consolidated balance sheets. Certain investments in other companies are reported at fair value based on market quoted prices or using the Black Scholes Option Pricing model in the consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the Company’s long-term debt, as disclosed in Note 3, is estimated based on current rates offered to the Company for similar debt. 
Segment Reporting
GAAP requires disclosures related to components of a company for which separate financial information is available to, and regularly evaluated by, the Company’s chief operating decision maker when deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company’s 
two
 reportable segments consist of (1) the operations of SkyWest Airlines and SWC (collectively, “SkyWest Airlines and SWC”) and (2) SkyWest Leasing activities. I
nformation pertaining to the Company’s reportable segments is presented in Note 2, 
Segment Reporting
.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
At December 31, 2024, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (ASC Topic 280) – Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures,” issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The standard is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. 
This ASU also expands disclosure requirements to enable users of financial statements to better understand the entity’s measurement and assessment of segment performance and resource allocation. 
As required by the standard, the Company recast prior year segment disclosures to conform to the current year presentation. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. For further details, refer to 
Note
 2, “Segment Reporting.”
In December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-09, “Income Taxes (ASC Topic 740) – Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures”, which enhances the transparency, effectiveness and comparability of income tax disclosures by requiring consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information related to income tax rate reconciliations and the jurisdictions in which income taxes are paid. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this new guidance on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

Table of Contents
In March 2024, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2024-03, “Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income – Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (ASC Subtopic 220-40) – Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses”, which enhances the transparency and comparability of financial statements by requiring companies to disclose more granular information about expense components. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this new guidance on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
(2) Segment Reporting
GAAP requires disclosures related to components of a company for which separate financial information is available to, and regularly evaluated by, the Company’s chief operating decision maker when deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company’s chief operating decision maker is the chief executive officer.
The Company’s 
two
 reportable segments consist of (1) the operations of SkyWest Airlines and SWC and (2) SkyWest Leasing activities.
The Company’s chief operating decision maker analyzes the profitability of operating new aircraft financed through the issuance of debt, including the Company’s E175 fleet, separately from the profitability of the Company’s capital deployed for ownership and financing of such aircraft. The SkyWest Airlines and SWC segment includes revenue earned under the applicable capacity purchase agreements attributed to operating such aircraft and the respective operating costs, and revenue and operating expenses attributed to prorate agreements and airport services agreements. The SkyWest Leasing segment includes applicable revenue earned under the applicable capacity purchase agreements attributed to the ownership of new aircraft acquired through the issuance of debt and the respective depreciation and interest expense of such aircraft. The SkyWest Leasing segment also includes the activity of leasing regional jet aircraft and spare engines to third parties and other activities. The SkyWest Leasing segment’s total assets and capital expenditures include new aircraft acquired through the issuance of debt and assets leased to third parties. Additionally, aircraft removed from SkyWest Airlines’ operations and held for sale are included in the SkyWest Leasing segment.
The chief operating decision maker assesses performance for each segment and decides how to allocate resources based on income before income taxes. The chief operating decision maker uses the segment profit or loss measure when assessing performance of the segment and monitors budget versus actual results to allocate resources for each segment predominantly in the annual budget and forecasting process.
The following represents the Company’s segment data for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 (in thousands).

As required by the adoption of ASC 2023-07, the Company recast the 2023 and 2022 segment disclosures to conform to the current year presentation.

For the year ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company released a $
0.6
 million and $
1.1
 million, respectively, valuation allowance related to certain deferred tax assets associated with state net operating losses with a limited carry forward period. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a $
1.7
 mi
llion valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets associated with state net operating losses with a limited carry forward period.
 The decrease in this valuation allowance in 2024 was primarily based on changes in the Company's state income tax projections by jurisdiction which increased the amount of deferred tax assets that are anticipated to be utilized prior to the deferred tax assets expiring.
The Company recorded a $
0.9
 million benefit, a $

The Company’s deferred tax liabilities were primarily generated through accelerated depreciation, combined with shorter depreciable tax lives, allowed under the IRS tax code for purchased aircraft and support equipment compared to the Company’s depreciation policy under GAAP for such assets (see Note 1, “Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”).
At

December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had federal net operating losses of approximately $
377.9
 million and $
566.3
 million and state net operating losses of approximately $
280.3
 million and $
316.2
 million, respectively.  The estimated effective tax rate applicable to the federal and state net operating losses at December 31, 2024, was 
21.0
% and 
3.45
%, respectively. The Company anticipates that the federal and state net operating losses will start to expire in 2035 and 2025, respectively. The Company has no ongoing federal or state examinations. Federal tax years 2021, 2022 and 2023 are open to examination.
Under 
ASC 
Topic 740, the accounting guidance related to uncertainty in tax positions requires that the impact of a tax position be recognized in the financial statements if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position.

(5) Commitments and Contingencies
Self-Insurance
The Company self-insures a portion of its potential losses from claims related to workers’ compensation, environmental issues, property damage, medical insurance for employees and general liability. Losses are accrued based on an estimate of the ultimate aggregate liability for claims incurred, using standard industry practices and the Company’s actual experience. The Company uses judgment and estimates in determining the ultimate aggregate liabilities for claims incurred in its workers’ compensation liability. The Company also used assumptions in determining the workers compensation liability such as an estimation of loss payment and loss reporting development patterns. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s accrued workers’ compensation liability totaled $
18.5
 million and $
20.6
 million, respectively, of which $
9.0
 million and $
7.3
 million, respectively, was short-term and included in other current liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Legal Matters
The Company is subject to certain legal actions which it considers routine to its business activities. As of December 31, 2024, management believed, after consultation with legal counsel, that the ultimate outcome of such legal matters was not likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations.
Concentration Risk and Significant Customers
The Company requires no collateral from its major airline partners or customers, but monitors the financial condition of its major airline partners. Under the majority of the Company’s code-share agreements, the Company receives weekly payments from its major code-share partners that approximate a significant percentage of the compensation earned for such period. Additionally, the Company provides certain customer service functions at multiple airports for various airlines and the Company maintains a credit loss reserve based upon expected collectability of all accounts receivable. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company’s contractual relationships with Delta and United combined accounted for approximately 
72.3
%, 
70.9
% and 
72.5
%, respectively of the Company’s total revenues.
Employees Under Collective Bargaining Agreements
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately 
15,000
 employees. Although 
no
 SkyWest Airlines employees are represented by a national union, the majority of SkyWest Airline employees are covered by a written, stable and binding collective bargaining agreement under the Railway Labor Act, entered into between SkyWest Airlines and long-established labor associations, such as the SkyWest Airlines Pilot Association (“SAPA”). 
Aircraft and Other Purchase Commitments
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had a purchase commitment to purchase 
eight
 new E175 aircraft in 2025 and 
eight
 new E175 aircraft in 2026.
In addition to the above, in 2024, the Company entered into a master equipment purchase agreement with another airline to acquire certain airframes and engines and lease the assets back to the airline under a 
five-year
 term. At December 31, 2024, the Company estimates the remaining financing obligation under the agreement will be between $
60.0
 million and $
70.0
 million and anticipates closing on the remaining financings during 2025.
Guarantees
In 2022, the Company agreed to guarantee $
19.8
 million of debt for a 14 CFR Part 135 air carrier. The debt is secured by the Part 135 air carrier’s aircraft and engines and has a 
five-year
 term. In exchange for providing the guarantee, the Company received 
6.5
% of the guaranteed amount as consideration, payable in the estimated value of common stock of the Part 135 air carrier, all of which was sold in 2023. The balance of the debt under the guarantee was $
14.1
 million as of December 31, 2024. 
68

Table of Contents
In 2023, the Company agreed to guarantee up to 
$
12.0
 million of debt for an aviation school. The debt is secured by the school’s aircraft and engines and has a 
five-year
 term. 
In exchange for providing the guarantee, the Company receives 
2.0
% of the guaranteed amount annually as consideration in cash. The balance of the debt under the guarantee was $
10.6
 million as of December 31, 2024. 
The purpose of these guarantees is to help reduce the financing costs of aircraft for the third-parties in an effort to increase the potential number of commercial pilots in the Company’s hiring pipeline. The Company also recorded the estimated credit loss associated with the guarantees based on publicly available historical default rates issued by a third party for companies with similar credit ratings, factoring the collateral and guarantee term. 
(6) Leases
The Company leases property and equipment under operating leases. For leases with durations longer than 12 months, the Company recorded the related operating lease right-of-use asset and operating lease liability at the present value of lease payments over the term. The Company used its incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments based on information available at lease commencement.
Aircraft
As of December 31, 2024, excluding aircraft financed by the Company’s major airline partners that the Company operates for them under contract, the Company leased 
eight
 aircraft under long-term lease agreements with remaining terms ranging from 
four
 to 
six years
. These 
eight
 aircraft are subleased to a third-party. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company acquired 
35
 CRJ aircraft under early lease buyout arrangements with the lessors for $
142.4
 million. The aircraft were in the Company’s operating fleet when the lease buyouts occurred.
Airport facilities 
The Company has operating leases for facility space including airport terminals, office space, cargo warehouses and maintenance facilities. The Company generally leases this space from government agencies that control the use of the various airports. The remaining lease terms for facility space vary from 
one month
 to 
32 years
. The Company’s operating leases with lease rates that are variable based on airport operating costs, use of the facilities or other variable factors are excluded from the Company’s right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities in accordance with accounting guidance. 
Leases
As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s right-of-use assets were $
87.7
 million, the Company’s current maturities of operating lease liabilities were $
20.4
 million, and the Company’s noncurrent lease liabilities were $
67.3
 million. During 2024, the Company paid $
28.9
 million under operating leases reflected as a reduction from operating cash flows.

(7) Fair Value Measurements
The Company holds certain assets that are required to be measured at fair value in accordance with GAAP. The Company determined fair value of these assets based on the following three levels of inputs:
​
Level 1
—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2
—Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Some of the Company’s marketable securities primarily utilize broker quotes in a non-active market for valuation of these securities.
Level 3
—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.
​
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company held certain assets that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below (in thousands):

The Company did not make any significant transfers of securities between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company’s policy regarding the recording of transfers between levels is to record any such transfers at the end of the reporting period.
(8) Assets Held for Sal
e
In
 2022, the Company committed to a formal plan to sell 
14
 CRJ700 aircraft and determined the aircraft met the criteria to be classified as assets held for sale. In connection with the classification of these assets as held for sale, the Company recorded an impairment loss of 
$
51.4
 million, which is included in “Other operating expenses” on the Company’s consolidated statements of comprehensive income and in the SkyWest Leasing segment for the year ended December 31, 2022.
During 2023, the Company recorded a 
$
2.3
 million loss related to changes in the fair value of the 
14
 aircraft held for sale which is included in “Other operating expenses” on the Company’s consolidated statements of comprehensive income and in the SkyWest Leasing segment for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company presented the 
$
54.3
 million of assets held for sale at the lower of their current carrying value or their fair market value less costs to sell and included the amount in “Other current assets” on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. 
In March 2024, the Company decided not to sell the 
14
 CRJ700 aircraft based on improved pilot availability and reclassified them as held for use assets in “Aircraft and rotable spares” on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The Company remeasured the fair value of the held for use assets at the time of the reclassification and, as a result, in 2024, the Company recorded a 
$
4.2
 million gain (pre-tax), as an offset to “Other Operating Expenses” in the Company’s consolidated statement of income, primarily due to the elimination of the estimated costs to sell the assets.
The fair values were based upon observable and unobservable inputs, including a third-party valuation, market trends and condition of the airframes and engines. 
(9) Capital Transactions
Preferred Stock
The Company is authorized to issue 
5,000,000
 shares of preferred stock in one or more series without shareholder approval. 
No
 shares of preferred stock are presently outstanding. The Company’s Board of Directors is authorized, without any further action by the shareholders of the Company, to (i) divide the preferred stock into series; (ii) designate each such series; (iii) fix and determine dividend rights; (iv) determine the price, terms and conditions on which shares of preferred stock may be redeemed; (v) determine the amount payable to holders of preferred stock in the event of voluntary or involuntary liquidation; (vi) determine any sinking fund provisions; and (vii) establish any conversion privileges.
Stock Compensation
On May 7, 2019, the Company’s shareholders approved the adoption of the SkyWest, Inc. 2019 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which provided for the issuance of up to 
4,500,000
 shares of common stock to the Company’s directors, employees, consultants and advisors (the “2019 Incentive Plan”). On May 7, 2024, the Company’s shareholders 
71

Table of Contents
approved the amendment and restatement of the 2019 Incentive Plan (“Restated 2019 Incentive Plan”), providing an additional 
1,298,000
 shares of common stock to be issued. The Restated 2019 Incentive Plan provides for awards in the form of options to acquire shares of common stock, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock grants, restricted stock units and performance awards. The Restated 2019 Incentive Plan is subject to a fungible ratio concept, such that the issuance of stock options and stock appreciation rights reduces the number of available shares under the Restated 2019 Incentive Plan on a 
1
-for-1 basis, and the issuance of other awards reduces the number of available shares under the Restated 2019 Incentive Plan on a 
1.65
-for-1 basis. The Restated 2019 Incentive Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Compensation Committee”). As of December 31, 2024, the Restated 2019 Incentive Plan had 
3.5
 million plan shares remaining available for future issuance, based on target payout for granted and unvested PSUs. 
Stock Options
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not grant any options to purchase shares of common stock to its employees. The Company had no outstanding stock options as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. The following table summarizes the stock option activity for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

Performance Share Units
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Compensation Committee granted PSUs, which are performance-based restricted stock units, to certain Company employees. The PSUs have a 
three-year
 vesting period, during which the recipient must remain employed with the Company. The number of PSUs awardable may exceed the target amount granted depending on the Company’s performance over 
three

one-year
 measurement periods against the pre-established targets. The Company’s compensation expense for PSUs is based upon the projected number of PSUs estimated to be awarded at the conclusion of the performance period. During the 2024 year, the Company granted 
118,021
 PSUs at target performance, all of which were 
outstanding
 as of December 31, 2024 and have a potential payout of 
236,042
 shares, or 
200
% of target, if the Company’s performance exceeds the pre-established goals for a maximum payout associated with this grant. During the 2023 year, the Company granted 
391,810
 PSUs at target performance, all of which were 
outstanding
 as of December 31, 2024 and have a potential payout of 
979,525
 shares, or 
250
% of target, if the Company’s performance exceeds the pre-established goals for a maximum payout associated with this grant. During the 2022 year, the Company granted 
225,345
 PSUs at target performance, of which 
219,054
 were outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and have a potential payout of 
547,635
 shares, or 
250
% of target, if the Company’s performance exceeds the pre-established goals for a maximum payout associated with this grant. During 2024, the Compensation Committee determined the Company achieved 
150
% of target and awarded 
74,445
 additional shares related to the performance share grant in 2021 based on the Company’s performance for the 2021 and 2022 performance periods, measured against the pre-established targets for each period. 
The Compensation Committee determines the achievement of performance results and 
corresponding vesting of performance shares for each year’s grant following the conclusion of the respective performance period.

As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $
20.1
 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested restricted stock grants and non-vested performance stock units.

The Company expects to recognize this cost over a weighted average period of 
1.7
 years.
Taxes
The Company’s treatment of stock option grants of non-qualified options, restricted stock units and performance shares results in the creation of a deferred tax asset, which is a temporary difference, until the time that the option is exercised or the restrictions lapse.
Warrants
In 2020 and 2021, the Company issued to Treasury warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock under the Payroll Support Programs and Secured Loan. 
The warrants had a

 term from the date of issuance. 
The weighted average grant-date fair value of these warrants was estimated 
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. 
The current holder of the warrants exercised all 
785,226
 warrants in 2024. The Company settled the exercise through net share issuances of a total of 
481,201
 shares of common stock to the holder. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had 
no
 warrants issued and outstanding. 
The Company did not issue any warrants for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

(12) Investments in Other Companies
Equity Method Investments
During 2019, the Company created a joint venture with Regional One, Inc. (“Regional One”) and, as of December 31, 2024, has invested a total of $
26.6
 million for a 
75
% ownership interest in Aero Engines, LLC. (“Aero Engines”). The primary purpose of Aero Engines is to lease engines to third parties. Aero Engines requires unanimous approval from the Company and Regional One for all material transactions. Although the Company determined Aero Engines is a variable interest entity, Aero Engines has no primary beneficiary as no one party has power over Aero Engines. Accordingly, the Company accounts for its investment in Aero Engines under the equity method. The Company’s exposure in its investment in Aero Engines primarily consists of the Company’s portion of income or loss from Aero Engines’ engine lease agreements with third parties and the Company’s ownership percentage in Aero Engines’ engines book value. Aero Engines had 
no
 debt outstanding as of December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s investment balance in Aero Engines was $
23.9
 million and has been recorded in “Other Assets” on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The Company’s portion of the income generated by Aero Engines for the year ended December 31, 2024, was $
2.2
 million, which is recorded in “Other income, net” on the Company’s consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 
In December 2023, the Company invested $
9.9
 million
 for a 
9.9
%
 ownership interest in Corporate Flight Management, Inc. d/b/a C
ontour Airlines (“Contour”), a 
14 CFR Part 135 air carrier. 
In January 2024, the Company invested an additional 
$
15.1
 million in Contour. The Company has a 
25
%
 ownership interest in Contour at December 31, 2024 and holds 
one
 of 
five
 seats, or 
20
%
, on Contour’s board of directors. Additionally, the Company received an option to acquire additional ownership interest in Contour, which had an expiration date of December 31, 2024. The Contour arrangement also includes an asset provisioning agreement under which the Company will provide CRJ airframes, engines and rotable parts to Contour. The Company accounts for its investment in Contour under the equity method where the investment is reported at cost and adjusted each period for the Company’s share of Contour’s income or loss, recorded on a one quarter lag. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded income of 
$
0.1
 million related to its Contour investment, its portion of income generated by Contour, which was recorded in “Other income, net” on the Company’s consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded a loss of 
$
3.7
 million related to the expiration of a purchase option to acquire an additional ownership interest in Contour. 
As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s investment balance in Contour of $
21.4
 million was recorded in “Other Assets” on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2024, the Company had $
10.8
 million in notes receivable from Contour related to the sale of aircraft under the asset provisioning agreement. The notes are secured by aircraft and collectible within 
four years
.
The Company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable.
Fair Value Method Investment
In 2021, the Company entered into a strategic partnership with Eve UAM (“Eve”), to develop a network of deployment for Eve’s eVTOL aircraft.
In 2022, the Company acquired 
1,000,000
 shares of common stock of Eve and a warrant giving the Company the right to acquire 
1,500,000
 shares of common stock of Eve at an exercise price of 
$
0.01
 per share. The Company also received a put option from an Eve shareholder for the 
1,000,000
 shares of common stock of Eve payable in aircraft parts credits. The intent of the put option was to reduce the Company’s investment risk in Eve. 
The Company is restricted from selling the shares underlying the warrant until May 2025, and the warrant expires in May 2032. 
The Company acquired the shares of common stock, warrant and put option (collectively the “Eve Investments”) for 
$
10.0
 million. The Company evaluated the Eve Investments under ASC Topic 321, “Investments – Equity Securities” and ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging,” and recorded the Eve Investments based on their pro rata share of the consideration paid using the fair value of the Eve Investments on the acquisition date, with subsequent changes in the fair value reported in earnings. 
During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company sold 
600,411
 shares of common stock of Eve, which concurrently forfeited the 
600,411
 shares subject to the put option from the Eve shareholder. 
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company exercised the remainder of the put option and received aircraft parts credits in 
76

Table of Contents
exchange for the 
399,589
 shares of common stock. At December 31, 2024, the Company’s only remaining investment in Eve was the warrant to acquire 
1,500,000
 shares of common stock of Eve.
The shares of common stock of Eve were classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy as Eve stock is actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange, and the value is determined using quoted market prices for the equity security. 
The warrant and put option (prior to the exercise of the put option) were classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy (“Eve Level 3 Investments”). The Company 
used the Black Scholes Option Pricing Model to determine the estimated fair market value of the 
Eve Level 3 Investments
.

ITEM 9.  CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
None.
ITEM 9A.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, which have been designed to ensure that information we are required to disclose in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported accurately and within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, those controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control
During the most recently completed fiscal quarter, we did not make any changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies may deteriorate.
Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, using the criteria issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013). Based on that evaluation, management believes that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP (“Ernst & Young”), the independent registered public accounting firm who also has audited our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report. Ernst & Young’s report on our internal control over financial reporting appears on the following page.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
​
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of SkyWest, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited SkyWest, Inc. and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, SkyWest, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2 and our report dated February 13, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
