ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
General
Through SkyWest Airlines, we offer scheduled passenger service to destinations in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Substantially all of our flights are operated as United Express, Delta Connection, American Eagle or Alaska Airlines flights under code-share agreements with United, Delta, American or Alaska, respectively. Code-share agreement are commercial agreements between airlines that, among other things, allow one airline to use another airline’s flight designator codes on its flights. As of December 31, 2024, we offered approximately 2,190 daily departures, of which approximately 890 were United Express flights, 700 were Delta Connection flights, 380 were American Eagle flights and 220 were Alaska Airlines flights.
We generally provide regional flying to our major airline partners under long-term, fixed-fee, code-share agreements. Under these fixed-fee agreements (commonly referred to as “capacity purchase agreements”), our major airline partners generally pay us fixed rates for operating the aircraft primarily based on the number of completed flights, flight time and the number of aircraft under contract. The major airline partners either directly pay for or reimburse us for specified direct operating expenses, including fuel expenses. Our operations are conducted principally at airports that support our major airline partners’ route networks, including Chicago (O’Hare), Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Phoenix, Salt Lake City, San Francisco and Seattle. 
We conduct our code-share operations with our major airline partners pursuant to various code-share agreements described under the heading “Code-Share Agreements” below.
Fleet
SkyWest has been flying since 1972. During our long operating history, we have developed an industry-leading reputation for providing quality regional airline service. As of December 31, 2024, our fleet consisted of aircraft manufactured by Embraer S.A. (“Embraer”) and MHI RJ Aviation ULC, formerly known as Bombardier Aerospace (“Bombardier”), including the E175 regional jet aircraft (“E175”), the Canadair CRJ900 regional jet aircraft (“CRJ900”), the Canadair CRJ700 regional jet aircraft (“CRJ700”), including a 50-seat configuration of the CRJ700 aircraft, commonly referred to as a “CRJ550” and the Canadair CRJ200 regional jet aircraft (“CRJ200”). As of December 31, 2024, we had 624 total aircraft in our fleet, including 492 aircraft in scheduled service or under contract pursuant to our code-share agreements, summarized as follows:

SkyWest Leasing
SkyWest Leasing is a reportable segment that includes revenue associated with our financing of new aircraft with debt under our capacity purchase agreements, currently consisting of our E175 aircraft, and the depreciation and interest expense of our E175 aircraft. The SkyWest Leasing segment additionally includes the revenue and expense from leasing aircraft and engines to third parties. The SkyWest Leasing segment’s total assets and capital expenditures include the acquired E175 aircraft and aircraft and engines leased to third parties. 
As of December 31, 2024, SkyWest Leasing leased 35 CRJ700 aircraft, five CRJ900 aircraft and regional jet aircraft engines to third parties. 
SkyWest Charter (SWC)
In 2022, we formed a new subsidiary, SWC, which began operations in 2023. SWC offers on-demand charter service using CRJ200 aircraft in a 30-seat configuration. As of December 31, 2024, SWC had 18 aircraft available for on-demand charter service.
Competition and Economic Conditions
The airline industry is highly competitive. We compete principally with other regional airlines. Our operations extend throughout most major geographic markets in the United States. Our competition includes, therefore, nearly every other domestic regional airline. Our primary competitors include Air Wisconsin Airlines Corporation (“Air Wisconsin”); Endeavor Air, Inc. (“Endeavor”) (owned by Delta); Envoy Air Inc. (“Envoy”), PSA Airlines, Inc. (“PSA”) and Piedmont Airlines (“Piedmont”) (Envoy, PSA and Piedmont are owned by American); Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (“Horizon”) (owned by Alaska Air Group, Inc.); GoJet Airlines, LLC (“GoJet”); Mesa Air Group, Inc. (“Mesa”); and Republic Airways Holdings Inc. (“Republic”). Major airlines typically award code-share flying agreements to regional airlines based primarily upon the following criteria: ability to fly contracted schedules, availability of labor resources, including pilots, low operating cost, financial resources, geographical infrastructure, overall customer service levels relating to on-time arrival and flight completion percentages and the overall image of the regional airline. Additionally, each major airline may be limited in the number and type of regional aircraft it may use in its network due to agreements the major airline has with its own labor groups, commonly referred to in the industry as “scope limitations.” Given our major airline partners’ scope limitations, we currently do not operate a regional aircraft configured with more than 76 seats. 
The principal competitive factors for regional airline code-share agreements include labor resources, code-share agreement terms, reliable flight operations, operating cost structure, ability to finance new aircraft, certification to operate certain aircraft types and geographical infrastructure supporting markets and routes served. 
Our operations represent the largest regional airline operations in the United States. However, regional carriers owned by major airlines may have access to greater resources than we do through their parent companies.
Generally, the airline industry is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions. Economic downturns, combined with competitive pressures, have contributed to a number of reorganizations, bankruptcies, liquidations and business combinations among major and regional carriers. The effect of economic downturns may be somewhat mitigated by our predominantly contract-based flying agreements. If, however, any of our major airline partners experience a prolonged decline in the number of passengers or are negatively affected by low ticket prices or high fuel prices, they may seek rate reductions in future code-share agreements, or materially reduce scheduled flights in order to reduce their costs. In addition, adverse weather conditions can impact our ability to complete scheduled flights and can have a negative impact on our operations and financial condition. Also, major airline scope limitations may restrict growth opportunities for the regional carriers. Additionally, attrition of our pilots or other workgroups may reduce our flying schedules and have a negative impact on our operations and financial condition.

Impact of Regional Airline Captain Availability on Production
As passenger demand in the airline industry recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the number of regional airline captains and first officers hired by major airlines and low-cost carriers significantly increased. As a result, we experienced a high level of captain and first officer attrition during 2022 and 2023. During 2024, captain attrition began to ease. Sequential fluctuations in the number of completed departures and completed block hours from 2022 to 2024 were primarily driven by available captains.
Capacity and flight schedule impact.
 We completed the following number of flights and related block hours in 2024, 2023 and 2022:

Industry Overview
Majors, Low-Cost Carriers and Regional Airlines
The airline industry in the United States has traditionally been comprised of several major airlines, including Alaska, American, Delta and United. The major airlines offer scheduled flights to most major U.S. cities, numerous smaller U.S. cities, and cities throughout the world through a hub-and-spoke network.
Low-cost carriers, such as Southwest Airlines Co. (“Southwest”), JetBlue Airways Corporation (“JetBlue”), Spirit Airlines, Inc. (“Spirit”), Allegiant Travel Company (“Allegiant”), Frontier Group Holdings, Inc. (“Frontier”) and Breeze Aviation Group, Inc. (“Breeze”) generally have lower cost structures than major airlines, which permits them to offer flights to and from many of the same markets as the major airlines, but at lower prices. Low-cost carriers typically operate using a point-to-point network strategy, rather than a hub-and-spoke network.
Regional airlines, including SkyWest, typically operate smaller aircraft on shorter routes than major and low-cost carriers. Several regional airlines, including Endeavor, Envoy, Horizon, Piedmont and PSA, are wholly-owned subsidiaries of major airlines.
Regional airlines generally do not try to establish an independent route system and compete with the major airlines. Rather, regional airlines typically enter into agreements with one or more major airlines, pursuant to which the regional airline agrees to use its smaller, lower-cost aircraft to carry passengers booked and ticketed by the major airline between a hub of the major airline and a smaller outlying city. In exchange for such services, the major airline pays the regional airline either fixed fees to operate the flight, termed “capacity purchase agreement,” or “flying contract,” or the regional airline receives a percentage of applicable passenger ticket revenues on designated flights operated by the regional airline, termed “prorate agreement” as described in more detail below.
Code-Share Agreements
Regional airlines generally enter into code-share agreements with major airlines, pursuant to which the regional airline is authorized to use the major airline’s two-letter flight designator codes to identify the regional airline’s flights and fares in the central reservation systems, to paint its aircraft with the colors and/or logos of the major airline and to market and advertise its status as a carrier for the major airline. Code-share agreements also generally obligate the major airline to provide services such as reservations, ticketing, ground support and gate access to the regional airline, and the major airline often coordinates marketing, advertising and other promotional efforts. In exchange, the regional airline provides a designated number of low-capacity (usually between 50 and 76 seats) flights between larger airports served by the major airline and surrounding cities, usually in lower-volume markets. The financial arrangements between the 
6

Table of Contents
regional airlines and their code-share partners usually involve either capacity purchase agreements or prorate agreements as explained below:
●
Capacity Purchase Agreements.  
Under a capacity purchase agreement, the major airline generally pays the regional airline a fixed-fee for each departure, flight hour (measured from takeoff to landing, excluding taxi time) and block hour (measured from takeoff to landing, including taxi time) and an amount per aircraft in service each month with additional incentives based on completion of flights, on-time performance and other operating metrics. The regional airline typically acquires or finances the aircraft used under the capacity purchase agreement, which is accounted for as a lease of the aircraft to our major airline partner. In addition, under a capacity purchase agreement, the major airline bears the risk of fuel price fluctuations and certain other costs. Regional airlines benefit from capacity purchase agreements because they are protected from some of the elements that typically cause volatility in airline financial performance, including variations in ticket prices, number of passengers onboard each flight and increasing fuel prices. However, regional airlines with capacity purchase agreements generally do not benefit from positive trends in ticket prices, ancillary revenue, such as baggage and food and beverage fees, the number of passengers enplaned or decreasing fuel prices, because the major airlines retain passenger fare volatility risk and fuel costs associated with the regional airline flight.
●
Prorate Agreements.  
Under a prorate agreement, the major airline and regional airline negotiate a passenger fare proration formula for specifically identified routes, pursuant to which the regional airline receives a percentage of the ticket revenues for those passengers traveling for one portion of their trip on the regional airline and the other portion of their trip on the major airline. On the other hand, the regional airline receives all of the passenger fare when a passenger purchases a ticket on a route solely operated by the regional airline. Substantially all costs associated with the regional airline flight are borne by the regional airline, including the fuel cost. In a prorate agreement, the regional airline may realize increased profits as ticket prices and passengers carried increase or fuel prices decrease and, correspondingly, the regional airline may realize decreased profits as ticket prices and passengers carried decrease or fuel prices increase.
We have code-share agreements with United, Delta, American and Alaska. During the year ended December 31, 2024, approximately 87% of our flying agreements revenue related to capacity purchase agreement flights, where United, Delta, American and Alaska controlled scheduling, ticketing, pricing, and seat inventories. The remainder of our flying agreements revenue during the year ended December 31, 2024, related to prorate flights for United or Delta, where we controlled scheduling, pricing and seat inventories on certain prorate routes, and shared passenger fares with United or Delta according to prorate formulas and SWC on-demand charter flights. The routes placed under our prorate agreements typically include flight service between one of our partners’ hub cities and a city not served under our capacity purchase agreements.
Under our capacity purchase agreements, our major airline partners compensate us for our costs of owning the aircraft on a monthly basis. The aircraft compensation structure varies by agreement but is intended to cover either our aircraft principal and interest debt service costs or our aircraft depreciation and interest expense while the aircraft is under contract. The number of aircraft under our capacity purchase agreements and our prorate agreements as of December 31, 2024 is reflected in the summary below. The following summaries of our code-share agreements with our major airline partners do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the applicable agreement.

Training and Aircraft Maintenance
We provide substantially all training to our crew members and maintenance personnel at our training facilities. Our employees perform routine airframe and engine maintenance along with periodic inspections of equipment at our maintenance facilities. We also use third-party vendors for certain airframe and engine maintenance work.
Fuel
Our capacity purchase agreements with United, Delta, American and Alaska require the respective major airline partner to pay for fuel costs, either directly to the fuel vendor or to reimburse us for the fuel costs we incur under those agreements, thereby reducing our exposure to fuel price fluctuations. Under our prorate agreements with United and Delta, we are responsible for the costs to operate the flights, including fuel costs, and therefore we are exposed to fuel price fluctuations for flights operated under our prorate agreements. During the year ended December 31, 2024, our major airline partners purchased the majority of the fuel for our aircraft flying under their respective capacity purchase agreements directly from their fuel vendors or, when applicable, reimbursed us for the fuel costs we incurred under the capacity purchase agreements. Historically, we have not experienced sustained material problems with the availability of fuel and believe we will be able to obtain fuel in quantities sufficient to meet our existing and anticipated future requirements at competitive prices. We typically purchase fuel from third-party suppliers for our prorate agreements. A substantial increase in the price of jet fuel for flights we operate under our prorate agreements, or the lack of adequate fuel supplies in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
Human Capital Resources
Employee Profile
As of December 31, 2024, we employed 14,610 total employees, consisting of 5,048 pilots, 4,612 flight attendants, 1,716 airport operations personnel, 1,463 maintenance technicians, 887 other maintenance personnel, 198 dispatchers and 686 operational support and administrative personnel. Our total employees at December 31, 2024, included 1,734 part-time employees. As of December 31, 2024, all our employees are employed by SkyWest Airlines or to a limited extent, by SWC. Certain SkyWest Airlines employees also provide administrative support to the SkyWest Leasing segment. Approximately 89.2% of these employees were represented by in-house labor associations that have entered into collective bargaining agreements regarding employee compensation and work rules. None of these employees are currently represented by an outside union. Outside union organizing efforts among our employees do occur from time to time and may continue in the future. If unionization efforts are successful, we may be subjected to increased risks of work interruption or stoppage; and/or we may be limited in our ability to communicate with our employees, which would negatively impact our culture and working relationship with our employees. Additionally, an outside union may limit our ability to increase employee wages to market rates in a timely manner which could result in low employee job satisfaction and increased employee attrition. SkyWest Airlines has never experienced a work stoppage due to a strike or other labor dispute, and we consider our relationships with our employees to be good.
Our relations with labor are governed by the Railway Labor Act (the “RLA”), the federal law governing labor relations between air carriers and their employees. Under the RLA, a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor representative does not expire, but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date. If either party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement, it must notify the other party in the manner prescribed by the RLA and/or described in the agreement. After receipt of such notice, the parties must meet for direct negotiations, and if no agreement is reached, either party may request the National Mediation Board (“NMB”) to initiate a process including mediation, arbitration, and a potential “cooling off” period that must be followed before either party may engage in “self-help.” “Self-help” includes, among other things, a strike by the representative or the imposition of proposed changes to the collective bargaining agreement by the airline. If the NMB believes that self-help has the risk “substantially to interrupt interstate commerce to a degree such as to deprive any section of the country of essential transportation service,” it may recommend that the President establish a Presidential Emergency Board (“PEB”).  The PEB would hear testimony and make a recommendation regarding how to resolve the outstanding issues.  
We respect all employees’ legal rights, including the rights to free association and collective bargaining. This includes the right to decide whether to be represented by a union. Under the RLA, employees have the right to decide whether they wish to be represented by a union. They also have the right to reject union representation.

In September 2022, we entered into a collective bargaining agreement with our pilots, increasing the pay rates for pilots. Additionally, during the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we amended our capacity purchase agreements with our major airline partners which resulted in higher compensation as a result of our increased labor costs. We have also worked with our other operational workgroups to secure significant increases in each of their pay scales and bonuses, including a 35% increase in starting pay for SkyWest flight attendants in 2023.
Culture
At SkyWest our people are our most valued assets, and the success of our business is dependent on having a collaborative, engaged and effective workforce. We respect every individual's quality of life and are committed to promoting integrity and trust in all we do. We strive to be the partner of choice and employer of choice. 
Health & Safety
Safety is the primary focus and foundation of our culture with our first guiding principle being Health and Safety First. We expect our employees to think, plan, communicate and act appropriately to prevent injury, illness or harm to themselves, fellow employees, passengers and aircraft. SkyWest’s Safety Management System (SMS) integrates an intentional safety culture into every work group and every employee process from new hire through retirement, focusing on industry-best practices in safety competencies and behaviors. Training is required for every SkyWest employee, regardless of position.
SkyWest’s SMS is designed to identify, track, and help mitigate potential safety risks before an incident or accident occurs. Employees are encouraged to participate in our voluntary programs to report potential safety concerns or violations to reduce safety risk, including, but not limited to our Aviation Safety Action Program and Safety Concern Report.
●
Aviation Safety Action Program is a non-punitive program that allows employees in participating work groups to self-disclose violations of policies and procedures. Each report is reviewed by an Event Review Committee who helps identify any potential trends and determines whether corrective actions have been put into place to prevent the problem from occurring in the future. 
●
Safety Concern Reporting is a confidential program that allows all employees to identify potential safety risks within the operation. Each report is reviewed and investigated, as needed, by the Safety Department. Employees may also report safety concerns to their direct manager, the facility manager, a facility safety committee member or confidentially through our safety hotline.
Attracting, Developing and Retaining Talent
Recruitment Strategies. 
We strive to be the employer of choice for aviation professionals pursuing a career in the regional airline industry and we continually update our recruiting strategies to attract quality aviation professionals. We adapt our recruitment efforts based on the supply of eligible aviation professionals and our outlook for anticipated future flight schedules. Our recruiting focus generally targets key aviation technical roles, especially pilots and mechanics. We seek qualified individuals through publishing positions on both internal and external career websites, supporting professional development leads, investment in targeted advertising, social media outreach, employee referrals and relationships with community-based organizations and educational institutions. 
School Partnerships and Development. 
We maintain relationships with numerous flight schools and educational institutions across the country that are focused on developing the next generation of aviation professionals. We have also developed relationships with numerous aviation mechanic schools. We typically recruit pilots and maintenance technicians that have completed required coursework from an accredited flight or maintenance school, respectively, and have obtained other applicable certifications. We also provide other programs to enhance our recruiting efforts towards individuals who are in process of completing their training, including a Pilot Pathway Program and an Aviation Maintenance Technician (AMT) Pathway Program.
●
The SkyWest Pilot Pathway Program provides a direct path for qualified pilots seeking to begin their aviation career in the regional airline industry. Participants benefit from the SkyWest Pilot Pathway

Program through certain starting seniority at SkyWest, final interview privileges and access to pilot mentors. The Pilot Pathway Program allows students to remain at their campus to complete their flight training until they meet SkyWest's Airline Transport Pilot standards and achieve their required minimum hours of flight time. Each participant may also participate in SkyWest recruiting events and outreach programs on their way to fulfilling commercial pilot jobs.
●
The SkyWest AMT Pathway Program provides a career path for maintenance technicians seeking employment with SkyWest. Participants benefit from the SkyWest AMT Pathway Program through accelerated starting seniority at SkyWest, guaranteed final interview upon meeting requirements and access to mechanic advisors. 
Ongoing Training and Retention. 
SkyWest invests in retaining its professionals by providing a range of talent development opportunities, including mandatory compliance training, new hire training and general professional development, as well as engaging in the training of leaders through leadership development courses. Our training programs include full-motion flight simulators for pilots, on-the-job training for technicians, and cabin trainers for flight attendants. We also reinforce our guiding principles, including but not limited to, health and safety, personal and corporate integrity, excellent service and quality, and respect and teamwork through our training and development programs, as well as through our employee appreciation and recognition programs.

Employee Reporting
Our Code of Conduct contains general guidelines for conducting business in an ethical manner. We are committed to a working environment that is safe and supports open and honest communication. We have established a reporting system for any SkyWest employee to report a violation of Company policy including harassment, discrimination, drug and alcohol use, questionable financial practice, or a breach involving safety or security. A general grievance may also be filed even if an employee has already utilized their chain of command or chooses to remain anonymous. Our Code of Conduct also forbids retaliation against any employee who, in good faith, reports a suspected

violation of law or policy. Reports can be filed using a toll-free ethics and grievance hotline or by using an online reporting system on SkyWest’s intranet.
Government Regulation
All interstate air carriers, including SkyWest, are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation (the “DOT”), the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (the “FAA”) and other governmental agencies. Regulations promulgated by the DOT primarily relate to economic aspects of air service. The FAA requires operating, airworthiness and other certificates; approval of personnel who may engage in flight, maintenance or operating activities; record-keeping procedures in accordance with FAA requirements; and FAA approval of flight training and retraining programs. Generally, governmental agencies enforce their regulations through, among other methods, certifications, which are necessary for the continued operations of SkyWest, and proceedings, which can result in civil or criminal penalties or revocation of operating authority. The FAA can also issue maintenance directives and other mandatory orders relating to, among other things, grounding of aircraft, inspection of aircraft, installation of new safety-related items and the mandatory removal and replacement of aircraft parts.
We believe SkyWest complies, in all material respects, with FAA regulations and holds all operating and airworthiness certificates and licenses which are necessary to conduct our operations. We maintain current certifications and otherwise comply with the laws, rules and regulations to which we are subject. Our flight operations, maintenance programs, recordkeeping and training programs are conducted under FAA approved procedures. All air carriers operating in the United States are required to comply with federal laws and regulations pertaining to noise abatement and engine emissions. All such air carriers are also subject to certain provisions of the Federal Communications Act of 1934, as amended, because of their extensive use of radio and other communication facilities. SkyWest is also subject to certain federal and state laws relating to protection of the environment, labor relations and equal employment opportunity. We believe SkyWest complies, in all material respects, with these laws and regulations.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental protection matters. These laws and regulations govern such matters as environmental reporting, storage and disposal of materials and chemicals and aircraft noise. We are, and expect in the future to be, involved in various environmental matters and conditions at, or related to, our properties. We are not currently subject to any environmental cleanup orders or actions imposed by regulatory authorities. We are not aware of any active material environmental investigations related to our assets or properties.
As the largest regional airline in the United States, we remain committed to working with our major airline partners to lower our environmental footprint while continuing to offer the best service to our customers and the communities we serve. Our largest source of emissions and environmental impact comes from utilizing jet fuel on flights operated under our code-share agreements with our major airline partners. Under our capacity purchase agreements, our major airline partners purchase the aircraft fuel we consume, select the aircraft type we operate, and set flight schedules, all of which are variables which impact fuel consumption efficiencies. During 2024, we produced approximately 5.6 million metric tons of CO

e from fuel burned, using industry emissions factors, on flights we operated under our code-share agreements. We are largely dependent on direction from our major airline partners regarding long-term fuel saving initiatives such as engine innovations reducing fuel consumption, use of sustainable alternative fuels, carbon sequestration programs, air traffic flow routing efficiencies, and similar initiatives. Each of our major airline partners may pursue alternative strategies and goals to reduce carbon emissions on flights we operate under our code-share agreements that may impact the rate at which we are able to reduce our carbon emissions, if at all. We anticipate our major airline partners will take responsibility for carbon emissions incurred on our contract flights.
Our board of directors has oversight of our environment-related performance. Through software and training, we heavily monitor and manage our fuel trends and fuel consumption which leads to better fuel management and reductions in emissions. When possible, we conserve fuel burned by utilizing single engine taxi procedures, improving the efficiency of aircraft routing, using performance-based navigation procedures to reduce track miles, and using ground power when parked at the gate. Additionally, we collaborate with aircraft and engine manufacturers and our major airline partners regarding innovations and emerging technologies that could improve fuel efficiencies and minimize environmental impact. We are also collaborating with our major airline partners and fuel providers regarding long-term

opportunities to use sustainable aviation fuel in the future. We are evaluating opportunities to increase the number of electric powered ground equipment, including tugs and pushbacks used at airports where we provide ramp services. We participate with our major airline partners in recycling programs, and we have implemented recycling initiatives in our facilities to reduce the amount of paper, plastic and other recyclables going to landfills. We have worked aggressively to reduce our reliance on paper manuals, further eliminating unnecessary waste while increasing efficiencies.
We have entered into a strategic partnership with Eve UAM, LLC (“Eve UAM”), an Embraer company, to develop a network of deployment for Eve UAM’s electric vertical takeoff and landing (“eVTOL”) aircraft. Subject to an agreement of key commercial terms, this partnership includes the option for SkyWest to purchase up to 100 eVTOL aircraft.
Safety and Security
We are committed to the safety and security of our passengers and employees. We have taken many steps, both voluntarily and as mandated by governmental authorities, to increase the safety and security of our operations. Some of the safety and security measures we have taken with our major airline partners include: aircraft security and surveillance, aircraft cleaning procedures, positive bag matching procedures, enhanced passenger and baggage screening and search procedures and securing of cockpit doors. We are committed to complying with future safety and security requirements.
Insurance
We maintain insurance policies we believe are of types customary in the industry and in amounts we believe are adequate to protect against material loss. These policies principally provide coverage for public liability, passenger liability, baggage and cargo liability, property damage, including coverage for loss or damage to our flight equipment, and workers’ compensation insurance. 
Seasonality
Our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year, in part because the airline industry is subject to seasonal fluctuations and changes in general economic conditions. Our operations are somewhat favorably affected by pleasure travel on our prorate routes, historically contributing to increased travel in the summer months, and are unfavorably affected by decreased business travel during the months from November through January and by inclement weather which can result in cancelled flights, principally during the winter months. Additionally, a significant portion of our capacity purchase agreements are based on completing flights and we typically have more scheduled flights during the summer months. We generally experience a significantly higher number of weather cancellations during the winter months, which negatively impacts our revenue during such months.
