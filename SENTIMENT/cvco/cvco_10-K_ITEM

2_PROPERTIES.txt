We own the land on which manufacturing facilities are located, except for the Goodyear, Arizona plant, which is currently leased through June 2026, with no current options to extend; and the Dorchester, Wisconsin plant, currently under lease through August 2037, with options to extend. We also own substantially all of the machinery and equipment used at these factories. In addition to production facilities, we own an office building and land in New Braunfels, Texas, which houses Standard Casualty's operations, as well as eight properties upon which active, Company-owned retail stores are located. The remaining active sales centers and a claims office are leased under operating leases with lease terms generally ranging from monthly to five years. Company-owned retail stores generally range in sizes up to nine acres. We lease office space in Plano, Texas for CountryPlace operations and factory-built housing administrative support services. The lease expires in July 2036, with options to extend. The Phoenix, Arizona home office is leased through March 2031. The Elkhart, Indiana office is leased through February 2040, with options to extend. We believe that all of these facilities are adequately maintained and suitable for the purposes for which they are used.
