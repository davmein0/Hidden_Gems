Item 3.    Legal Proceedings
From time to time, we might be subject to various legal proceedings relating to claims arising out of our operations. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against us in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Except as described in this Item 3, we are not currently involved in any material legal proceedings, the ultimate disposition of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition or cash flows.
Securities Class Action Lawsuits 
On May 29, 2024, a putative securities class action complaint was filed against us, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer (collectively, the "Defendants") in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned 
Bialic v. Enphase Energy, Inc
., Case No. 3:24-cv-03216-BLF (the “Bialic Action”), purportedly on behalf of a class of individuals who purchased or otherwise acquired our common stock between February 7, 2023 and April 25, 2023. 
On July 15, 2024, a second putative class action complaint was filed naming the same Defendants in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned 
Hayes v. Enphase Energy, Inc.
, Case No. 3:24-cv-04249 (the “Hayes Action” and with the Bialic Action, the “Securities Class Action”), purportedly on behalf of a class of individuals who purchased or otherwise acquired our common stock between December 12, 2022 and April 25, 2023. Both the Bialic Action and the Hayes Actions allege that Defendants made false and/or misleading statements in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. Both plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages and other relief. 
On or about July 23, 2024, the plaintiff in the Bialic Action voluntarily dismissed the case.
On or about July 29, 2024, six additional stockholders filed motions to be appointed lead plaintiff and have their selection of counsel appointed as lead counsel. The Court held a hearing on the lead plaintiff motions on 
Enphase Energy, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 45
Table

September 5, 2024, but has not yet issued a decision. Once a lead plaintiff and lead counsel are appointed, the parties will negotiate a schedule for an anticipated amended complaint and motion to dismiss.
On December 13, 2024, a third putative class action complaint was filed naming us, our chief executive officer and our chief products officer (collectively, “Defendants II”) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned Trustees of the Welfare and Pension Funds of Local 464A v. Enphase Energy, Inc., Case No. 3:24-cv-09038 (the “Pension Fund Action”), purportedly on behalf of a class of individuals who purchased or otherwise acquired our common stock between April 25, 2023 and October 22, 2024. The Pension Fund Action alleges that Defendants II made false and/or misleading statements in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. The plaintiff seeks unspecified monetary damages and other relief.
We dispute the allegations in each of the above-referenced lawsuits and intend to defend the matters vigorously.
Shareholder Derivative Lawsuits
On July 16, 2024, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed purportedly on our behalf against the Defendants, our non-employee directors and us (as nominal defendant) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned 
Ibarra v. Kothandaraman, et al
., Case No. 3:24-cv-04278 (the “Ibarra Action”). The Ibarra Action asserts claims for breaches of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and contribution under Sections 10(b) and 21D of the Exchange Act based on the purported dissemination of substantially the same allegedly false and misleading statements asserted in the Securities Class Action. The Ibarra Action is seeking unspecified damages and other relief, including reforms and improvements to our corporate governance and internal procedures. 
On September 5, 2024, another shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed purportedly on our behalf against the Defendants, our non-employee directors and us (as nominal defendant) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned 
Isaac v. Kothandaraman, et al., 
Case No. 4:24-cv-06257-KAW (the “Isaac Action” and with the Ibarra Action, the "Derivative Action"), containing substantially the same allegations as those in the Ibarra Action. On September 20, 2024, the Court consolidated the Isaac and Ibarra Actions.
On October 11, 2024, the Court granted the parties’ stipulation to stay the Derivative Action until all motions to dismiss the Securities Class Action are decided.
On December 31, 2024, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed purportedly on our behalf against Defendants II, our non-employee directors and us (as nominal defendant) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned Hirani v. Kothandaraman, et al., Case No. 4:24-cv-09532 (the “Hirani Action”). The Hirani Action asserts claims for breaches of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and contribution under Sections 10(b) and 21D of the Exchange Act based on the purported dissemination of substantially the same allegedly false and misleading statements asserted in the Pension Fund Action. The Hirani Action is seeking unspecified damages and other relief, including reforms and improvements to our corporate governance and internal procedures.
On January 17, 2025, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed purportedly on our behalf against Defendants II, our non-employee directors and us (as nominal defendant) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned Hanowski v. Kothandaraman, et al., Case No. 3:25-cv-000652 (the “Hanowski Action”). The Hanowski Action asserts claims substantially similar to those asserted in the Hirani Action, also based on the same allegedly false and misleading statements asserted in the Pension Fund Action. The Hanowski Action is seeking unspecified damages and other relief, including reforms and improvements to our corporate governance and internal procedures.
On January 31, 2025, the plaintiffs in the Hirani and Hanowski Actions filed a motion to relate their actions to the Pension Fund Action.
We dispute the allegations in each of the above-referenced lawsuits and intend to defend the matters vigorously. 
The pending lawsuits and any other related lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties, and the actual defense and disposition costs will depend upon many unknown factors. We could be forced to expend significant

resources in the defense of the pending lawsuits and any additional lawsuits, and we may not prevail. In addition, we may incur substantial legal fees and costs in connection with such lawsuits.
Zola Electric International, Ltd. v. Enphase Energy, Inc.
On July 17, 2024, Zola Electric International, Ltd. (“Zola”) filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against us, alleging breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing related to a joint development agreement and master supply agreement between Zola and us. On September 19, 2024, we filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, and all briefing papers were filed with the Court on or before November 8, 2024.

Business Overview and 2024 Highlights
We are a global energy technology company. We deliver smart, easy-to-use solutions that manage solar generation, storage and communication on one platform. Our intelligent microinverters work with virtually every solar panel made, and when paired with our smart technology, result in one of the industry’s best-performing clean energy systems. As of December 31, 2024, we have shipped approximately 80.0 million microinverters, and approximately 4.7 million Enphase residential and commercial systems have been deployed in more than 160 countries.
We sell primarily to solar distributors who combine our products with others, including solar module products and racking systems, and resell to installers in each target region. In addition to our solar distributors, we sell directly to select large installers, OEMs and strategic partners. Our OEM customers include solar module manufacturers who integrate our microinverters with their solar module products and resell to both distributors and installers. Strategic partners include providers of solar financing solutions. We also sell certain products and services to homeowners primarily in support of our warranty services and legacy product upgrade programs, via our online store.
During the fiscal year 
2024
, our priorities included providing great customer service, scaling business processes, increasing efficiencies, reducing operating costs and the ongoing development of hardware and software to enhance our Enphase Energy System offering. Quality, customer service and innovation are cornerstones of our strategy, and we believe our focus on these priorities will continue to help drive our success going forward.
To reduce supply chain risk and take advantage of new incentives for domestic manufacturing, we expanded our operations with contract manufacturers in the United States with a capacity to produce five million microinverters per quarter. Beginning in the second half of 
2024
, we began shipping residential and commercial microinverters, and batteries, with higher domestic content from our U.S. contract manufacturers, which are expected to help certain solar and battery projects qualify for the domestic content bonus tax credit. The domestic content bonus tax credit is only available to commercial asset owners, which includes commercial businesses adding solar and PPA/lease providers who own residential solar projects. 
We also

expanded deployments of our IQ8 series Microinverters into many new regions globally, including shipments of IQ8 Microinverters with higher peak output AC power to support newer, high-powered solar modules. We began shipping our third-generation Enphase Energy System with IQ Battery 5P in several new markets globally. We also launched IQ Battery 5P in India with the IQ System Controller, enabling backup power in a region with frequent outages.
Global Events Affecting our Business and Operations
As we have a growing global footprint, we are subject to risk and exposure from the evolving macroeconomic environment, including the effects of increased global inflationary pressures, tariffs and interest rates, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, potential economic slowdowns or recessions, geopolitical pressures and potential regulatory changes, including the unknown impacts of current and future trade regulations. We continuously monitor the direct and indirect impacts of these circumstances on our business and financial results.
Demand for Products.
 The demand environment for our products experienced a broad-based slowdown beginning in the second quarter of 2023 in the United States and in the third quarter of 2023 in Europe that continued into 2024. This demand environment has negatively impacted several distributors and installers, resulting in reduced liquidity, bankruptcy and business closures, which has affected our revenue and profitability, days sales outstanding and allowances for credit losses. The slower demand environment also resulted in elevated inventory with distributors and installers in late 2023 and the first half of 2024, and as a result we sold fewer microinverters to distributors and installers during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.
Enphase Energy, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 49
Table 
of Contents

In the United States, this slowdown was primarily the result of higher interest rates, high channel inventory and the transition from NEM 2.0 to NEM 3.0 in California. Higher interest rates resulted in larger monthly costs and longer pay-back periods for those customers who financed their systems. In Europe, this slowdown was primarily driven by a softer customer demand as utility rates dropped and policy changes were implemented. This resulted in oversupply, financial stresses throughout the industry and the resulting channel inventory correction. In addition, there has been increased uncertainty in NEM policies and solar export penalties in a key European market. The phase out of NEM in that market was ultimately not approved but solar export penalties are still causing uncertainty among consumers. While we believe we have made the appropriate corrections to our channel inventory, some of the foregoing trends in the United States and Europe could continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations in 2025.
Components of Consolidated Statements of Operations
Net Revenues
We generate revenue from sale of our various solutions, which include microinverter units and related accessories, IQ Battery and related accessories, IQ PowerPack 1500 and related accessories, IQ Gateway and IQ Energy Router, cloud-based monitoring services, EV charging solutions, design, proposal, permitting, installation and lead generation services, as well as a platform matching cleantech asset owners to a local and on-demand workforce of service providers, distributors, large installers, OEMs and strategic partners.
Our revenue is affected by changes in the volume and average selling prices (“ASPs”) of our various solutions and related accessories, supply and demand, sales incentives, government incentives and competitive product offerings. Our revenue growth is dependent on our ability to compete effectively in the marketplace by remaining cost competitive, macroeconomic conditions, favorable regulatory environment, developing and introducing new products that meet the changing technology, and performance requirements of our customers, the diversification and expansion of our revenue base, and our ability to market our products in a manner that increases awareness for microinverter technology and differentiates us in the marketplace.
Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit
Cost of revenues is comprised primarily of product costs, warranty, manufacturing and installation services support personnel, logistics costs, freight costs, inventory write-downs, hosting services costs related to our cloud-based monitoring services, depreciation of manufacturing test equipment, amortization of capitalized software development costs related to our cloud-based monitoring services, lead acquisition costs and design and proposal services, employee-related expenses associated with proposal and permitting services and design and proposal service customer support. AMPTC earned under the IRA for U.S. manufactured microinverters shipped to customers in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 are treated as a reduction to cost of revenues.
Our product costs are impacted by technological innovations, such as advances in semiconductor integration and new product introductions, economies of scale resulting in lower component costs, and improvements in production processes and automation. Certain costs, primarily personnel and depreciation and amortization of test equipment and capitalized software development costs, are not directly affected by sales volume.
We outsource our manufacturing to third-party contract manufacturers and generally negotiate product pricing with them on a quarterly basis. We believe our contract manufacturing partners have sufficient production capacity to meet the anticipated demand for our products for the foreseeable future. However, shortages in the supply of certain key raw materials could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products. We contract with third parties, including one of our contract manufacturers, to serve as our logistics providers by warehousing and delivering our products in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, India, Brazil, the Philippines, Thailand, South Africa, and certain other Central American and  Asian countries.
Gross profit may vary from quarter to quarter and is primarily affected by our ASPs, product cost, product mix, customer mix, AMPTC, shipping costs, warranty costs and sales volume fluctuations.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative and restructuring and asset impairment charges. Personnel-related costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories, other than restructuring and asset impairment charges, and include salaries, benefits, payroll taxes, sales commissions, incentive compensation, post-combination expense and stock-based compensation.
Enphase Energy, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 50
Table 
of Contents

Research and development expense includes personnel-related expenses, third-party design and development costs, testing and evaluation costs, depreciation expense and other indirect costs. Research and development employees are primarily engaged in the design and development of power electronics, semiconductors, powerline communications, networking and software functionality, and storage. We devote substantial resources to research and development programs that focus on enhancements to, and cost efficiencies in, our existing products and timely development of new products that utilize technological innovation to drive down product costs, improve functionality, and enhance reliability. We intend to continue to invest appropriate resources in our research and development efforts because we believe they are critical to maintaining our competitive position.
Sales and marketing expense includes personnel-related expenses, travel, trade shows, marketing, customer support and other indirect costs. We expect to continue to make the necessary investments to enable us to execute our strategy to increase our market penetration geographically and enter into new markets by expanding our customer base of distributors, large installers, OEMs and strategic partners. We currently offer solutions targeting the residential and commercial markets in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, India, Brazil, the Philippines, Thailand, South Africa, Central America, the Caribbean and certain Asian countries. We expect to continue to expand the geographic reach of our product offerings and explore new sales channels in addressable markets in the future.
General and administrative expense includes personnel-related expenses for our executive, finance, human resources, information technology and legal organizations, facilities costs, and fees for professional services. Fees for professional services consist primarily of outside legal, accounting and information technology consulting costs.
Restructuring and asset impairment charges are the net charges resulting from restructuring initiatives implemented in 2022, 2023 and 2024 to increase operational efficiencies and execution, reduce operating costs, and better align our workforce and cost structure with current market conditions, as well as reflect our business needs, strategic priorities and ongoing commitment to profitable growth. Charges from the restructuring initiatives primarily consisted of employee severance and one-time benefits, workforce reorganization charges, contract termination charges, and asset impairment charges. Refer to 
Note 12.
 “Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges,” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Other Income, Net
Other income, net primarily consists of interest income on our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities, amortization of discount or premium on purchase of cash equivalents and marketable securities, gains or losses upon conversion of foreign currency transactions into U.S. dollars, interest expense, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, non-cash interest expense related to the accretion of debt discount and amortization of deferred financing costs, non-cash charges recognized for loss on partial settlement of convertible notes, and the change in fair value of our debt securities.
Income Tax Provision
We are subject to income taxes in the countries where we sell our products. Historically, we have primarily been subject to taxation in the United States because we have sold the majority of our products to customers in the United States. As we have expanded our global footprint for the sale of products to customers outside the United States, we have become subject to taxation based on the foreign statutory rates in the countries where these sales took place. As sales in foreign jurisdictions increase in the future, our effective tax rate may fluctuate accordingly. We regularly assess the ability to realize deferred tax assets based on the weight of all available evidence, including such factors as the history of recent earnings and expected future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis.

Net revenues decreased by $960.4 million, or 42%, in the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, driven primarily by a 58% decrease in microinverter units shipped, partially offset by an increase in ASP for our microinverters as we sold more IQ8 microinverters relative to IQ7 microinverters. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we sold approximately 6.5 million microinverter units, as compared to approximately 15.5 million microinverter units in the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in net revenues was also partially offset by a 48% increase in IQ Batteries MWh shipped. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we shipped 521.0 MWh of IQ Batteries, as compared to 351.6 MWh shipped in the year ended December 31, 2023. 
The overall decrease in net revenues during the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was due to a broad-based slowdown that began in 2023 in both the United States and Europe. This resulted in elevated inventory with distributors and installers, and as a result we sold fewer microinverters to distributors and installers during the year ended December 31, 2024 to normalize channel inventory, as compared to the same period in 2023. In the United States, this slowdown was primarily the result of higher interest rates, high channel inventory and the transition from NEM 2.0 to NEM 3.0 in California. Higher interest rates resulted in larger monthly costs and longer pay-back periods for those customers who financed their systems. In Europe, this slowdown was primarily driven by a softer customer demand as utility rates dropped and policy changes were implemented.

Cost of revenues decreased by $531.2 million, or 43%, in the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to the lower volume of microinverter units sold, as well as from the benefit recognized from tax credits of $157.5 million under the AMPTC for U.S. manufactured microinverters shipped to customers in the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to cost of revenues of $53.5 million in the same period in 2023. The benefit recognized from the AMPTC was partially offset by $38.3 million and $11.6 million of incremental cost for manufacturing in the United States in the year ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, thereby providing a Net IRA benefit of $119.2 million and $41.9 million, respectively.
Gross margin increased by 1.1 percentage points in the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to recognition of a 9.0 percentage point of Net IRA benefit in the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to a 1.8 percentage point Net IRA benefit in the same period in 2023, and an increase in ASP for microinverters, partially offset by product mix and relatively higher fixed overhead costs.

The decrease was primarily due to actions implemented in connection with the restructuring initiatives implemented in 2023 and 2024 that lowered personnel-related expenses by $16.2 million due to a reduction in headcount and lowered equipment and professional services costs by $9.8 million. The amount of research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period due to the differing levels and stages of development activity for our products.

The income tax provision was $17.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to an income tax provision of $74.2 million in the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower projected tax expense as our operations in U.S. and foreign jurisdictions were less profitable in 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, partially offset by an increase in tax expense from equity compensation shortfalls in 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023.
Liquidity and Capital Resources 
Sources of Liquidity
As of December 31, 2024, we had $1.7 billion in net working capital, including cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities, of which approximately $1.6 billion were held in the United States. Our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities primarily consist of U.S. Government agency securities and treasuries, money market mutual funds, corporate notes, commercial paper and bonds, and both interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing deposits, with the remainder held in various foreign subsidiaries. We consider amounts held outside the United States to be accessible and have provided for the estimated withholding tax liability on the repatriation of our foreign earnings.

Our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities increased by $22.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to cash generated from operations of $513.7 million, partially offset by $391.4 million in repurchases of common stock pursuant to the 2023 Repurchase Program and $78.8 million in payments of withholding taxes related to net share settlement of employee equity awards.
Total carrying amount of debt increased by $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to accretion of debt discount and issuance costs.
We expect that our principal short-term (over the next 12 months) cash needs related to our operations will be to fund working capital, strategic investments, acquisitions, repurchases of common stock and payments of withholding taxes for net share settlement of employee equity awards, payments on our outstanding debt and purchases of property and equipment. We plan to fund any cash requirements for the next 12 months from our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand, and cash generated from operations. For the long-term period (beyond 12 months), we aim to continue growing cash flows from operations to support our ongoing business operations and strategic investment plans. We regularly evaluate our liquidity position, debt obligations and expected cash requirements. As part of this ongoing assessment, we may pursue additional financing through the issuance of equity or the debt financing, as necessary, to meet our operational and investment needs. We anticipate that access to the debt market will be more limited compared to prior years as interest rates have increased and are expected to remain high. Our ability to obtain debt or any other additional financing that we may choose to, or need to, obtain will depend on, among other things, our development efforts, business plans, operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing.

Repurchase of Common Stock
. In July 2023, our board of directors authorized the 2023 Repurchase Program pursuant to which we were authorized to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our common stock. The repurchases could be funded from available working capital and could be executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The program may be discontinued or amended at any time and expires on July 26, 2026. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we repurchased 4,543,016 shares, for an aggregate amount of $391.4 million. Refer to 
Note 15
. “Stockholders’ Equity,” in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on our repurchase of common stock.
Convertible Notes
. As of December 31, 2024, our aggregate principal convertible notes obligations were $1,309.7 million, which primarily consisted of the Notes due 2028 of $575.0 million, Notes due 2026 of $632.5 million and Notes due 2025 of $102.2 million. Upon conversion of the Notes due 2026 and Notes due 2028, we expect to pay cash equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes of such series to be converted, and, at our election, will pay or deliver cash and/or shares of our common stock for the amount of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes of such series. Holders of Notes due 2025 may now convert their notes at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of March 1, 2025. These conversions will be settled in a combination settlement method with the principal value settled in cash and the remaining value in shares of our common stock. Refer to 
Note 13
. “Debt,” in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on our outstanding convertible notes.
Operating Leases
. We have entered into various non-cancelable operating leases primarily for our facilities with original lease periods expiring through the year 2033, with the most significant leases relating to our offices in Petaluma, California and Bengaluru, India. As of December 31, 2024, we had total operating lease obligations of $28.9 million recorded on our consolidated balance sheet.
Other Material Cash Requirements
. As of December 31, 2024, we had open purchase obligations of $130.9 million related to component inventory that our primary contract manufacturers procure on our behalf in accordance with our production forecast as well as other inventory related purchase commitments. The timing of purchases in future periods could differ materially from estimates presented above due to fluctuations in demand requirements related to varying sales levels as well as changes in economic conditions.

Cash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the broad-based slowdown in demand for our products, new regulations and other risk factors discussed in Part I, Item IA, Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Cash flows from operating activities consisted of our net income adjusted for certain non-cash reconciling items, such as stock-based compensation expense, non-cash interest expense, change in the fair value of debt securities, deferred income taxes, asset impairment, depreciation and amortization, and changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $183.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to lower net revenues.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
For the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash provided by investing activities of $128.3 million was primarily from the sales and maturities of marketable securities of $161.9 million, net of purchases, partially offset by $33.6 million used in purchases of test and assembly equipment for U.S. manufacturing, related facility improvements and information technology enhancements, including capitalized costs related to internal-use software.
For the year ended December 31, 2023, net cash used in investing activities of $366.4 million was primarily from the purchase of $241.0 million of marketable securities, net of sale and maturities, $110.4 million used in purchases of test and assembly equipment to expand our supply capacity, related facility improvements and information technology enhancements, including capitalized costs related to internal-use software, and $15.0 million used in the investment of a private company.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
For the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash used in financing activities of approximately $460.3 million was primarily from $391.4 million used to repurchase our common stock, payment of $78.8 million in employee withholding taxes related to net share settlement of employee equity awards, payment of $2.8 million in excise tax for net stock repurchases, and less than $0.1 million from the partial settlement of the Notes due 2025, partially offset by $12.7 million net proceeds from employee stock option exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan.
For the year ended December 31, 2023, net cash used in financing activities of approximately $516.8 million was primarily from $410.0 million used to repurchase our common stock and the payment of $120.6 million in employee withholding taxes related to net share settlement of employee equity awards, partially offset by $13.9 million net proceeds from employee stock option exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, fair value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of acquired intangible assets and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. 
Enphase Energy, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 58
Table 
of Contents

We have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates due to risks and uncertainties, including uncertainty in the current economic environment due to inflation, interest rates fluctuations and new regulations. As of the date of issuance of these financial statements, we are not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require us to update our estimates, judgments or revise the carrying value of our assets or liabilities. For a description of our significant accounting policies, refer to 
Note 2
. “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Revenue Recognition 
We generate revenues from sales of our solutions, which include microinverter units and related accessories, IQ Battery and related accessories, IQ PowerPack 1500 and related accessories, IQ Combiner, IQ Gateway, and IQ Energy Router, our cloud-based monitoring services, EV charging solutions, design, proposal, permitting, installation and lead generation services, as well as a platform matching cleantech asset owners to a local and on-demand workforce of service providers, distributors, large installers, OEMs and strategic partners.
We generally sell our products to our customers pursuant to a customer’s standard purchase order and our customary terms and conditions. We do not offer rights to return our products other than for normal warranty conditions, and as such, revenue is recognized based on the transfer of control. We evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers to determine appropriate credit limits prior to the acceptance and shipment of an order. A description of principal activities from which we generate revenues are as follows. 
•
Products Delivered at a Point in Time. 
We sell our products and professional services to customers in accordance with the terms of the related customer contracts. We generate revenues from sales of our solutions, which include microinverter units and related accessories, storage solutions, EV charging solutions, design, proposal, permitting, installation and lead generation services, as well as a platform matching cleantech asset owners to a local and on-demand workforce of service providers to distributors, large installers, OEMs and strategic partners. Microinverter units, microinverter accessories, storage and EV solutions, design proposal, permitting, installation and lead generation services, as well as completed work orders on our platform matching cleantech asset owners to a local and on-demand workforce of service providers, are delivered to customers at a point in time, and we recognize revenue for these products or professional services when we transfer control of the product or professional services to the customer, which is generally upon product shipment or service delivery, respectively.
•
Products Delivered Over Time. 
The sale of IQ Gateway and IQ Energy Router includes our cloud-based monitoring services. The full consideration for these products represents a single performance obligation and is deferred at the sale date and recognized over the estimated service period of 7 years. We also sell certain communication accessories that contain a service performance obligation to be delivered over time. The revenue from these products is recognized over the related service period, which is typically 5 years. The subscription services revenue generated from each customer’s subscription to our design and proposal service is recognized on a ratable basis over the contract term beginning on the date that our service is made available to the customer. The subscription contracts are generally 3 to 12 months in length and billed in advance.
When we sell a product with more than one performance obligation, such as our IQ Combiner, which includes both hardware and the IQ Gateway, the total consideration is allocated to these performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling prices.
Provisions for rebates, sales incentives and discounts are estimated based on promotions offered to customers, customer specific experience and historical product ASPs. We record such revenue promotions as variable consideration and recognize these promotions as a reduction in revenue at the time the related revenue is recorded.

We record upfront contract acquisition costs, such as sales commissions, to be capitalized and amortized over the estimated life of the asset. For contracts that have a duration of less than one year, we follow the Topic 606 practical expedient and expense these costs when incurred. Commissions related to the sale of monitoring hardware and services are capitalized and amortized over the period of the associated revenue.
Refer to 
Note

. “Revenue Recognition,” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to revenue recognition.
Inventory
Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market. Market is current replacement cost (by purchase or by reproduction, dependent on the type of inventory). In cases where market exceeds net realizable value (
i.e.
, estimated selling price less reasonably predictable costs of completion and disposal), inventories are stated at net realizable value. Market is not considered to be less than net realizable value reduced by an allowance for an approximately normal profit margin. We determine cost on a first-in first-out basis. Certain factors could affect the realizable value of its inventory, including customer demand and market conditions. Management assesses the valuation on a quarterly basis and writes down the value for any excess and obsolete inventory based upon expected demand, anticipated sales price, effect of new product introductions, product obsolescence, customer concentrations, product merchantability and other factors. Inventory write-downs are equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and market.
Government Grants
Government grants represent benefits provided by federal, state or local governments that are not subject to the scope of ASC 740. We recognize a grant when we have reasonable assurance that we will comply with the grant’s conditions and that the grant will be received. Government grants that are not related to long-lived assets are considered income-based grants, which are recognized as a reduction to the related cost of activities that generated the benefit. 
We recognized credits under the AMPTC as a reduction to cost of revenues in the consolidated statement of operations for the microinverters manufactured in the United States and sold to customers in the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. Such credit is also reflected as an increase to prepaid income tax within prepaid expenses and other current assets and reduction of income tax payable within accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets within accrued liabilities. There are currently several critical and complex aspects of the IRA that could affect the estimated benefits we have recognized and expect to recognize from the AMPTC. Any modifications to the law or its effects arising, for example, through (i) technical guidance and regulations from the IRS and U.S. Treasury Department, (ii) subsequent amendments to or interpretations of the law, and/or (iii) future laws or regulations rendering certain provisions of the IRA less effective or ineffective, in whole or in part, could result in material adverse changes to the benefits we have recognized and expect to recognize.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We have investments in debt securities categorized as level three in the fair value hierarchy based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement totaling $64.8 million and $79.9 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which is included in “Other assets” in the consolidated balance sheets.
The carrying amounts of our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments. Equity investments with readily determinable fair value are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices or estimated based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date. Equity investments without readily determinable fair value are measured at cost less impairment, and are adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer.
Warranty Obligations
Our warranty accrual provides for the replacement of microinverter units, AC Battery storage solutions and related accessories, EV Chargers, IQ Gateway units and IQ Energy Router units that fail during the product’s warranty term. The warranty term related to microinverter units is 15 years for first and second generation microinverters and up to 25 years for subsequent generation microinverters. The warranty term for AC Battery 
Enphase Energy, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 60
Table 
of Contents

storage solutions is 10 to 15 years depending on the generation and 5 years for IQ PowerPack 1500. The warranty term for the IQ Gateway and IQ Energy Router is 5 years, while the warranty term for EV Chargers is 1 to 5 years depending on the product. On a quarterly basis, we employ a consistent, systematic and rational methodology to assess the adequacy of our warranty liability. This assessment includes updating all key estimates and assumptions for each generation of product, based on historical results, trends and the most current data available as of the filing date. The key estimates and assumptions used in the warranty liability are thoroughly reviewed by management on a quarterly basis. The key estimates used by us to estimate our warranty liability are: (1) the number of units expected to fail and repaired or returned for replacement over time (
i.e.,
 return rate); and (2) the per unit cost of repair or replacement of units, including outbound shipping and limited labor costs, expected to be incurred to replace failed units over time (
i.e.,
 replacement cost).
Estimated Return Rates — 
Our Quality and Reliability department has primary responsibility to determine the estimated return rates for each generation of product. To establish initial return rate estimates for each generation of product, our quality engineers use a combination of industry standard mean time between failure estimates for individual components contained in that generation of product, third-party data collected on similar equipment deployed in outdoor environments similar to those in which our product are installed, and rigorous long term reliability and accelerated life cycle testing which simulates the service life of the product in a short period of time. As units are deployed into operating environments, we continue to monitor product performance through our cloud-based monitoring services. It typically takes three to nine months between the date of sale and date of end-user installation. Consequently, our ability to monitor actual failures of units sold similarly lags by three to nine months. When a product fails and is returned, we perform diagnostic root cause failure analysis to understand and isolate the underlying mechanism(s) causing the failure. We then use the results of this analysis (combined with the actual, cumulative performance data collected on those units prior to failure) to draw conclusions with respect to how or if the identified failure mechanism(s) will impact the remaining units deployed in the installed base. 
As the vast majority of our microinverters have been sold to end users for residential applications, we believe that warranty return rates will be affected by changes over time in residential home ownership because we expect that subsequent homeowners are less likely to file a return than the homeowners who originally purchased the microinverters.
Estimated Replacement Costs — 
Three factors are considered in our analysis of estimated replacement cost: (1) the estimated cost of replacement products; (2) the estimated cost to ship replacement products to end users; and (3) the estimated labor reimbursement expected to be paid to third-party installers, or estimated labor cost expected to be incurred for field service technicians, performing replacement services for the end user. Because our warranty provides for the replacement of defective products over long periods of time (typically between 5 to 25 years, depending on the product and the generation of that product purchased), the estimated per unit cost of current and future product generations is considered in the estimated replacement cost. Estimated costs to ship replacement units are based on observable, market-based shipping costs paid by us to third-party freight carriers. We have a separate program that allows third-party installers to claim fixed-dollar reimbursements for labor costs they incur to replace failed units for a limited time from the date of original installation. Included in our estimated replacement cost is an analysis of the number of fixed-dollar labor reimbursements expected to be claimed by third-party installers over the limited offering period. 
In addition to the key estimates noted above, we also compare actual warranty results to expected results and evaluate any significant differences. We may make additional adjustments to the warranty provision based on performance trends or other qualitative factors. If actual return rates, or replacement costs differ from our estimates in future periods, changes to these estimates may be required, resulting in increases or decreases in our warranty obligations. Such increases or decreases could be material.
Fair Value Option for Microinverters and Other Products Sold Since January 1, 2014
Our warranty obligations related to products sold since January 1, 2014 provide us the right, but not the requirement, to assign our warranty obligations to a third party. Under Accounting Standards Codification 825, “Financial Instruments” (also referred to as the “fair value option”), an entity may choose to elect the fair value option for such warranties at the time it first recognizes the eligible item. We made an irrevocable election to account for all eligible warranty obligations associated with products sold since January 1, 2014 at fair value. This election was made to reflect the underlying economics of the time value of money for an obligation that will be settled over an extended period of up to 25 years.
Enphase Energy, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 61
Table 
of Contents

We estimate the fair value of warranty obligations by calculating the warranty obligations in the same manner as for sales prior to January 1, 2014 and applying an expected present value technique to that result. The expected present value technique, an income approach, converts future amounts into a single current discounted amount. In addition to the key estimates of return rates, and replacement costs, we used certain inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. Such additional assumptions included compensation comprised of a profit element and risk premium required of a market participant to assume the obligation and a discount rate based on our credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Refer to 
Note 11
. “Fair Value Measurements,” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Income Taxes
We record income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts recognized for income tax purposes. In estimating future tax consequences, generally all expected future events other than enactments or changes in the tax law or rates are considered. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
We assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets to determine release of valuation allowance as necessary. In the event we determine that it is more likely than not that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should it be determined that additional amounts of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized in the future, an adjustment to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance will be charged to income in the period such determination is made.
We operate in various tax jurisdictions and are subject to audit by various tax authorities. We follow accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, which requires that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is “more likely than not” to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments, and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes.
Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
We operate and conduct business in foreign countries where our foreign entities use the local currency as their respective functional currency and, as a result, are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. More specifically, we face foreign currency exposure primarily from the effect of fluctuating exchange rates on payables and receivables relating to transactions that are denominated in euros, the Indian Rupee, Brazilian real, Mexican peso and the Australian, Canadian and New Zealand dollars. These payables and receivables primarily arise from sales to customers and intercompany transactions. We also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our European, Indian, Brazilian, Mexican, Australian, Canadian and New Zealand operations, including sales and marketing and research and development expenses, to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of a reporting period. We are a net receiver of euros, and therefore negatively affected by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and, conversely benefit from a weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro. Sales denominated in the euro as a percentage of net revenues was 21%, 28% and 17% during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
The effect of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities on December 31, 2024 would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations. To date, foreign currency transaction gains and losses and exchange rate fluctuations have not been material to our financial statements, and we have not engaged in any foreign currency hedging transactions.
We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We did not enter into any foreign currency forward contracts during 2024, 2023 and 2022. Any foreign currency forward contracts entered in the future will be accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts would be reported as other current assets or current liabilities, and gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value would be reported in other income (expense), net, in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

Credit Risk
Financial instruments that subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and accounts receivable. We maintain a substantial portion of our cash balances in non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing marketable securities and money market accounts. We mitigate this credit risk by transacting with major financial institutions with high credit ratings. We are not required to pledge, and are not entitled to receive, cash collateral related to these derivative instruments. We do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes. Our net revenues are primarily concentrated among a limited number of customers. We monitor the financial condition of our customers and perform credit evaluations whenever considered necessary and maintain an allowance for credit losses for estimated potential credit losses.
Interest Rate Risk
We had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities of $1,717.6 million and $1,695.0 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, consisting of both non-interest bearing and interest-bearing marketable securities and money market accounts. Such interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk, but the risk is limited due to the duration of our short term investments. To date, fluctuations in interest income have not been significant. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure. We have not been exposed to, nor do we anticipate being exposed to, material risks due to changes in interest rates with regard to our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities.
Our cash flow exposure due to changes in interest rates related to our debt is limited, as the Notes due 2025 have a fixed interest rate of 0.25%. Additionally, the Notes due 2028 and Notes due 2026 carry a fixed interest rate of 0%. The fair value of these convertible notes may increase or decrease for various reasons, including fluctuations in the market price of our common stock, fluctuations in market interest rates and fluctuations in general economic conditions. Based upon the quoted market price as of December 31, 2024, the fair value of the Notes due 2028, Notes due 2026 and Notes due 2025 was $472.9 million, $593.8 million and $106.1 million, respectively. 
A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates during any of the periods presented would not have had a material impact on our financial statements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Enphase Energy, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Enphase Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 7, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Warranty Obligations - Refer to Notes 2, 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company’s warranty obligation provides for the repair or replacement of microinverter and storage products that fail during the product’s warranty term, generally of 10 to 25 years. The estimated warranty liability is developed for each generation of product and requires management to estimate, among other factors, (1) the number of units expected to be claimed under the Company’s warranty over time (
i.e.,
 return rate); and (2) the per unit cost of repair or replacement of units, including outbound shipping and labor costs, expected to be incurred to repair or replace failed units over time (
i.e.,
 replacement cost), all of which consider historical results, trends and the most current data available when the financial statements are available to be issued. The Company’s warranty liability for all microinverter and storage products sold after January 1, 2014, is measured at fair value which incorporates a discount rate based on the Company’s credit adjusted risk free rate.
Given the subjectivity of (1) estimating the number of units expected to be claimed under the Company’s warranty over time; (2) the estimated cost to repair or replace such products, and (3) the specialized valuation skills

required in evaluating discount rates, performing audit procedures to evaluate whether the estimated return rates, repair or replacement costs and discount rate were appropriately determined as of December 31, 2024, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort. 
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the estimated warranty return rates, estimated repair or replacement costs and discount rate used in determining the warranty obligation included the following, among others:
–
We tested the effectiveness of controls utilized in the review of the warranty obligation calculation, including controls over the determination of estimated warranty return rates, estimated repair or replacement costs and discount rate.
–
We evaluated the methods and assumptions used by management to estimate warranty return rates, estimated repair or replacement costs and discount rate used as part of the calculation of the warranty obligation by:
•
Testing the underlying data that served as the basis for the Company’s estimated warranty return rates analysis, which include historical warranty returns and historical product sales, in order to evaluate the various assumptions and historical data consisting of failure of individual components contained in its microinverters and storage products.
•
Comparing management’s prior-year assumptions of estimated warranty return rates to actual warranty returns received during the current year to identify potential bias in the determination of the estimated warranty return rates used in the warranty obligation recorded.
•
Testing the relevant inputs into the Company’s per unit repair or replacement costs, including third party vendor quotes.
•
Testing the discount rate used in the Company’s warranty obligation, utilizing internal fair value specialists.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Enphase Energy, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Enphase Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 7, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1.    
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
Description of Business
Enphase Energy, Inc. (the “Company”) is a global energy technology company. The Company delivers smart, easy-to-use solutions that manage solar generation, storage and communication on one platform.
Basis of Presentation and Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates and assumptions reflected in the financial statements include revenue recognition, allowance for credit losses, stock-based compensation, deferred compensation arrangements, income tax provision, inventory valuation, government grants, accrued warranty obligations, fair value of investments, convertible notes, fair value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of acquired intangible assets and property and equipment, incremental borrowing rate for right-of-use assets and lease liability. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates due to risks and uncertainties

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Revenue Recognition
The Company generates revenue from sales of its solutions, which include microinverter units and related accessories, IQ Battery and related accessories, IQ PowerPack 1500 and related accessories, IQ Gateway, and IQ Energy Router, cloud-based monitoring services, Electric Vehicle (“EV”) charging solutions, design, proposal, permitting, installation and lead generation services, as well as a platform matching cleantech asset owners to a local and on-demand workforce of service providers, distributors, large installers, original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and strategic partners.
Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to the Company’s customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services. The Company generates all of its revenues from contracts with its customers. A description of principal activities from which the Company generates revenues follows. 
•
Products Delivered at a Point in Time. 
The Company sells its products and professional services to customers in accordance with the terms of the related customer contracts. The Company generates revenues from sales of its solutions, which include microinverter units and related accessories, storage solutions, EV charging solutions, design, proposal, permitting, installation and lead generation services, as well as a platform matching cleantech asset owners to a local and on-demand workforce of service providers to distributors, large installers, OEMs and strategic partners. Microinverter units, microinverter accessories, storage and EV solutions, design, proposal, permitting, installation and lead generation services, as well as completed work orders on a platform matching cleantech asset owners to a local and on-demand workforce of service providers, are delivered to customers at a point in time, and the Company recognizes revenue for these products or professional services when the Company transfers control of the product or professional services to the customer, which is generally upon product shipment or service delivery, respectively.
Enphase Energy, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 75

NOTES TO  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
•
Products Delivered Over Time. 
The sale of IQ Gateway and IQ Energy Router products includes the Company’s cloud-based monitoring service. The full consideration for these products represents a single performance obligation and is deferred at the sale date and recognized over the estimated service period of 
7
 years. The Company also sells certain communication accessories that contain a service performance obligation to be delivered over time. The revenue from these products is recognized over the related service period, which is typically 
5
 years. The subscription services revenue generated from each customer’s subscription to the Company’s design and proposal software is recognized on a ratable basis over the contract term beginning on the date that the Company’s service is made available to the customer. The subscription contracts are generally 
3
 to 
12
 months in length and billed in advance.
When the Company sells a product with more than one performance obligation, such as the IQ Combiner, which includes both hardware and IQ Gateway, the total consideration is allocated to these performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling prices.
The Company estimates and records certain revenue promotions as variable consideration and recognizes these promotions as a reduction in revenue at the time the related revenue is recorded.
The Company records upfront contract acquisition costs, such as sales commissions, to be capitalized and amortized over the estimated life of the asset. For contracts that have a duration of less than one year, the Company follows the Topic 606 practical expedient and expenses these costs when incurred. Commissions related to the Company’s sale of monitoring hardware and service are capitalized and amortized over the period of the associated revenue, which is 
5
 years to 
7
 years. 
Refer to 
Note 3
. “Revenue Recognition,” for additional information related to revenue recognition.
Cost of Revenues
The Company includes the following in cost of revenues: product costs, warranty, manufacturing and installation services personnel, logistics costs, freight costs, inventory write-downs, hosting services costs related to the Company’s cloud-based services, credits recognized from the advanced manufacturing production tax credit (“AMPTC”), depreciation of manufacturing test equipment, and amortization of capitalized software development costs related to the Company’s cloud-based services, lead acquisition costs, design and proposal services, and employee-related expenses associated with proposal and permitting services and design and proposal service customer support. A description of principal activities from which the Company recognizes cost of revenue is as follows:
•
Products Delivered at a Point in Time. 
Cost of revenue from these products is recognized when the Company transfers control of the product to the customer, which is generally upon shipment or service delivery.
•
Products Delivered Over Time. 
Cost of revenue from these products is recognized over the related service period.
Government Grants
Government grants represent benefits provided by federal, state, or local governments that are not subject to the scope of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740. The Company recognizes a grant when it has reasonable assurance that it will comply with the grant’s conditions and that the grant will be received. Government grants that are not related to long-lived assets are considered income-based grants, which are recognized as a reduction to the related cost of activities that generated the benefit.
In August 2022, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”), which includes extension of the investment tax credit as well as credits under the AMPTC, to incentivize clean energy component sourcing and production, including for the production of microinverters. The IRA provides for an AMPTC on microinverters of 11 cents per alternating current watt basis. The AMPTC on microinverters decreases by 25% each year beginning in 2030 and ending after 2032. The Company recognized credits under AMPTC as a reduction to cost of revenues in the consolidated statement of operations for the microinverters manufactured in the United States and sold to customers during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. Such credit is also reflected as an increase to prepaid income tax and a reduction of income tax payable on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets within 
Enphase Energy, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 76
Table

ENPHASE ENERGY, INC.
NOTES TO  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
prepaid expenses and other current assets and accrued liabilities, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, benefits recognized from AMPTC of $
157.5
 million and $
53.5
 million, respectively, were recorded as a prepaid income tax of $
94.9
 million (included in Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets) and reduction of income tax payable of $
62.7
 million on the consolidated balance sheet for the year ended December 31, 2024, reduction to income tax payable of $
53.5
 million (included in Accrued Liabilities) on the consolidated balance sheet for the year ended December 31, 2023, and as a reduction to cost of revenues of $
157.5
 million and $
53.5
 million on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements are based on management’s judgement and interpretation of the most current guidance.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities
The Company classifies investments in marketable securities as available-for-sale investments and records these marketable securities at fair value. The Company determines the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation at each balance sheet date. All highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents, while all others are presented within current assets since these investments represent funds available for current operations and the Company has the ability and intent, if necessary, to liquidate any of these investments within one year in order to meet liquidity needs or to grow the business, including for potential business acquisitions or other strategic transactions.
Marketable securities are recorded at fair value, with the unrealized gains or losses unrelated to credit loss factors included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Realized gains and losses and declines in value determined to be other than temporary based on the specific identification method are reported in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.
The Company periodically reviews whether the securities may be other-than-temporarily impaired, including whether or not (i) the Company has the intent to sell the security or (ii) it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery. If one of these factors is met, the Company records an impairment loss associated with the impaired investment. The impairment loss will be recorded as a write-down of investments in the consolidated balance sheets and a realized loss within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. There were no credit-related impairments recognized on the Company’s investments in marketable securities during the periods presented.
For purposes of identifying and measuring impairment, the policy election was made to exclude the applicable accrued interest from both the fair value and amortized cost basis. Applicable accrued interest of $
10.1
 million and $
7.6
 million, net of the allowance for credit losses, if any, is recorded in 
prepaid expenses and other current assets
 on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Restricted Cash
Restricted cash represents cash held as certificates of deposit collateralized under a letter of credit issued to a customer. The letter of credit is required as a performance security in a face amount equal to the aggregate purchase price of the executed sales agreement. The letter of credit was issued per the terms of the executed sales agreement and the Company has collateralized certificates of deposit under this letter of credit in an amount of $
95.0
 million, which was reflected as restricted cash on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The carrying amounts of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments. Equity investments with readily determinable fair value are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices or estimated based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date. Equity investments without readily determinable fair value 
Enphase Energy, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 77
Table 
of Contents

ENPHASE ENERGY, INC.
NOTES TO  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
are measured at cost, less impairment and are adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer.
Accounts Receivables and Contract Assets
The Company receives payments from customers based upon contractual payment terms. Accounts receivable are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract assets recorded in prepaid assets and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet include deferred product costs and commissions associated with the deferred revenue and will be amortized along with the associated revenue.
Allowance for Credit Losses
The Company maintains allowances for credit losses for uncollectible accounts receivable. Management estimates anticipated credit losses based on days past due, customer specific experience, collection history, the financial health of customers including from the impacts of the broad-based slowdown beginning in the second quarter of 2023 in the United States and in the third quarter of 2023 in Europe, among other factors.
 Accounts receivables are recorded net of allowance for credit losses totaling $
7.8
 million and $
2.5
 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The $
7.8
 million allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2024 includes $
6.2
 million related to a customer that filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (“Chapter 11 bankruptcy”) during the year ended December 31, 2024. Management will continue to monitor certain customers experiencing considerable financial difficulties to perform collectability assessment and evaluate the impact to the Company's revenue recognition and allowance for credit losses on its financial statements. Accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for credit losses. 
The following table sets forth activities in the allowance for credit losses for the periods indicated.

Inventory
Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market. Market is current replacement cost (by purchase or by reproduction, dependent on the type of inventory). In cases where market exceeds net realizable value (
i.e.,
 estimated selling price less reasonably predictable costs of completion and disposal), inventories are stated at net realizable value. Market is not considered to be less than net realizable value reduced by an allowance for an approximately normal profit margin. The Company determines cost on a first-in first-out basis. Certain factors could affect the realizable value of its inventory, including customer demand and market conditions. Management assesses the valuation on a quarterly basis and writes down the value for any excess and obsolete inventory based upon expected demand, anticipated sales price, effect of new product introductions, product obsolescence, customer concentrations, product merchantability and other factors. Inventory write-downs are equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and market.
Long-Lived Assets
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes amounts paid to acquire or construct the asset as well as any expenditure that substantially adds to the value of or significantly extends the useful life of an existing asset. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 
3
 to 
10
 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or expected useful life of the improvements.
Enphase Energy, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 78
Table 
of Contents

ENPHASE ENERGY, INC.
NOTES TO  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Internal-use software, whether purchased or developed, is capitalized at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. Costs associated with internally developed software are expensed until the point at which the project has reached the development stage. Subsequent additions, modifications or upgrades to internal-use software are capitalized only to the extent that they provide additional functionality. Software maintenance and training costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. The capitalization of internal-use software requires judgment in determining when a project has reached the development stage and the period over which the Company expects to benefit from the use of that software. Capitalized costs are recorded as part of property and equipment in the consolidated balance sheets. Capitalized internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, which is generally 
three years
, and is recorded as cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.
The Company capitalizes implementation costs related to cloud computing (
i.e.,
 hosting) arrangements that are accounted for as a service contract that meets the accounting requirement for capitalization as such implementation costs were incurred to develop or utilize internal-use software hosted by a third-party vendor. The capitalized implementation costs are recorded as part of “Other assets” on the consolidated balance sheets and is amortized over the length of the service contract.
Property and equipment, including internal-use software, and capitalized implementation costs related to cloud computing arrangements, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group and its eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset group’s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using an undiscounted cash flow analysis.
 The Company recorded asset impairment charges of $
2.3
 million, $
5.7
 million and 
zero
 in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, associated with property and equipment, net. There were no events or changes in circumstances that may indicate the carrying amount of the remaining long-lived assets is not recoverable.
Leases
The Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating lease assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments over the lease term.
The Company does not have any finance leases. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments over the lease term, discounted using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred and prepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives. The Company’s lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Leases with an initial term of one year or less are considered short-term leases and are not recognized as lease assets and liabilities. The Company recognizes the cost of such short-term leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the underlying agreement. The Company combines the lease and non-lease components in determining the operating lease assets and liabilities.
An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group.
 The Company recorded right of use asset impairment charges of less than $
0.1
 million, $
1.1
 million and $
1.2
 million in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Business Combinations
Assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of a business acquisition are generally recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition. The excess of purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Determining fair value of identifiable assets, particularly intangibles, and liabilities acquired also requires the Company to make estimates, which are based on all available information and in some cases assumptions with respect to the timing and amount of future revenues and expenses associated with an asset. Accounting for business acquisitions requires the Company to make judgments as to whether a purchase transaction is a multiple element contract, meaning that it includes other transaction components. This judgment 
Enphase Energy, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 79
Table 
of Contents

ENPHASE ENERGY, INC.
NOTES TO  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
and determination affect the amount of consideration paid that is allocable to assets and liabilities acquired in the business purchase transaction. Additional information existing as of the acquisition date but unknown to the Company may become known during the remainder of the measurement period, not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date, which may result in changes to the amounts and allocations recorded.
Goodwill
Goodwill results from the purchase consideration paid in excess of the fair value of the net assets recorded in connection with business acquisitions. Goodwill is not amortized but is assessed for potential impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level, which the Company has determined to be the same as the entity as a whole (entity level). The Company first performs qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Company’s reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If, after assessing the qualitative factors, the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment analysis will be performed.
Qualitative factors include industry and market consideration, overall financial performance, share price trends and market capitalization and Company-specific events. The Company determined, after performing a qualitative review of its 
one
 reporting unit, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. 
Accordingly, there was 
no
 indication of impairment in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 and no quantitative goodwill impairment test was performed.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets include patents and other purchased intangible assets. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis, with estimated useful lives ranging from 
5
 to 
9
 years. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and are also tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. Intangible assets with finite lives are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows used in determining the fair value of the asset group. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset group’s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. The Company recorded asset impairment charges of $
3.5
 million, $
3.8
 million and 
zero
 in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, associated with the developed technology and customer relationship intangible asset. There were no events or changes in circumstances that may indicate the carrying amount of remaining assets is not recoverable.
Contract Liabilities
Contract liabilities are recorded as deferred revenue on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and include payments received in advance of performance obligations under the contract and are realized when the associated revenue is recognized under the contract.
Warranty Obligations
The Company’s warranty accrual provides for the replacement of microinverter units, AC Battery storage solutions and accessories, EV Chargers, IQ Gateway and IQ Energy Router units that fail during the product’s warranty term. The warranty term related to microinverter units is typically 
15
 years for first and second generation microinverters and up to 
25
 years for subsequent generation microinverters. The warranty term for AC Battery storage solutions is 
10
 to 
15
 years for IQ Battery depending on the generation and 
5
 years for IQ PowerPack 1500. The warranty term for the IQ Gateway and IQ Energy Router is 
5
 years, while the warranty term for EV Chargers is 
1
 to 
5
 years depending on the product. On a quarterly basis, the Company employs a consistent, systematic and rational methodology to assess the adequacy of its warranty liability. This assessment includes updating all key estimates and assumptions for each generation of product, based on historical results, trends and the most current data available as of the filing date. The key estimates and assumptions used in the warranty liability are thoroughly reviewed by management on a quarterly basis. The key estimates used by the Company to estimate its warranty liability are: (1) the number of units expected to fail and be repaired or returned for replacement over time 
Enphase Energy, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 80
Table 
of Contents

ENPHASE ENERGY, INC.
NOTES TO  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(
i.e.,
 return rate); and (2) the per unit cost of repair or replacement of units, including outbound shipping and labor costs, expected to be incurred to replace failed units over time (
i.e., 
replacement cost).
Estimated Return Rates — 
The Company’s Quality and Reliability department has primary responsibility to determine the estimated return rates for each generation of product. To establish initial return rate estimates for each generation of product, the Company’s quality engineers use a combination of industry standard mean time between failure estimates for individual components contained in its product, third-party data collected on similar equipment deployed in outdoor environments similar to those in which the Company’s products are installed, and rigorous long term reliability and accelerated life cycle testing which simulates the service life of the product in a short period of time. As units are deployed into operating environments, the Company continues to monitor product performance through its cloud-based monitoring services. It typically takes 
three
 to 
nine months
 between the date of sale and date of end-user installation. Consequently, the Company’s ability to monitor actual failures of units sold similarly lags by 
three
 to 
nine months
. When a product fails and is returned, the Company performs diagnostic root cause failure analysis to understand and isolate the underlying mechanism(s) causing the failure. The Company then uses the results of this analysis (combined with the actual, cumulative performance data collected on those units prior to failure through the Company’s cloud-based monitoring services) to draw conclusions with respect to how or if the identified failure mechanism(s) will impact the remaining units deployed in the installed base.
As the vast majority of the Company’s microinverters have been sold to end users for residential applications, the Company believes that warranty return rates will be affected by changes over time in residential home ownership because the Company expects that subsequent homeowners are less likely to file returns than the homeowners who originally purchase the microinverters.
Estimated Replacement Costs — 
Three factors are considered in the Company’s analysis of estimated replacement cost: (1) the estimated cost of replacement products; (2) the estimated cost to ship replacement products to end users; and (3) the estimated labor reimbursement expected to be paid to third-party installers, or estimated labor cost expected to be incurred for field service technicians, performing replacement services for the end user. Because the Company’s warranty provides for the replacement of defective microinverters or other products over long periods of time (between 
5
 years to 
25
 years, depending on the product and the generation of that product purchased), the estimated per unit cost of current and future product generations is considered in the estimated replacement cost. Estimated costs to ship replacement units are based on observable, market-based shipping costs paid by the Company to third-party freight carriers. The Company has a separate program that allows third-party installers to claim fixed-dollar reimbursements for labor costs they incur to replace failed products for a limited time from the date of original installation. Included in the Company’s estimated replacement cost is an analysis of the number of fixed-dollar labor reimbursements expected to be claimed by third-party installers over the limited offering period.
In addition to the key estimates noted above, the Company also compares actual warranty results to expected results and evaluates any significant differences. Management may make additional adjustments to the warranty provision based on performance trends or other qualitative factors. If actual return rates or replacement costs differ from the Company’s estimates in future periods, changes to these estimates may be required, resulting in increases or decreases in the Company’s warranty obligations. Such increases or decreases could be material.
Fair Value Option for Microinverters and Other Products Sold Since January 1, 2014
The Company’s warranty obligations related to products sold since January 1, 2014 provide the Company the right, but not the requirement, to assign its warranty obligations to a third party. Under ASC 825, “Financial Instruments” (also referred to as “fair value option”), an entity may choose to elect the fair value option for such warranties at the time it first recognizes the eligible item. The Company made an irrevocable election to account for all eligible warranty obligations associated with products sold since January 1, 2014 at fair value. This election was made to reflect the underlying economics of the time value of money for an obligation that will be settled over an extended period of up to 
25
 years.

ENPHASE ENERGY, INC.
NOTES TO  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Company estimates the fair value of warranty obligations by calculating the warranty obligations in the same manner as for sales prior to January 1, 2014 and applying an expected present value technique to that result. The expected present value technique, an income approach, converts future amounts into a single current discounted amount. In addition to the key estimates of return rates and replacement costs, the Company used certain inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. Such additional assumptions included compensation comprised of a profit element and risk premium required of a market participant to assume the obligation and a discount rate based on the Company’s credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Refer to 
Note 11
. “Fair Value Measurements,” for additional information.
Warranty obligations initially recorded at fair value at the time of sale will be subsequently re-measured to fair value at each reporting date. In addition, the fair value of the liability will be accreted over the corresponding term of the warranty of up to 
25
 years using the effective interest method.
Commitments and Contingencies
In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to loss contingencies and loss recoveries, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of its business as well as tariff refunds. An accrual for a loss contingency or loss recovery is recognized when it is probable and the amount of loss or recovery can be reasonably estimated.
Common Stock Repurchase
The Company accounts for repurchase of common stock under ASC 505 and charges the entire cost of repurchase including excise tax accrued pursuant to the repurchase to the accumulated earnings (deficit).
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs, which are expensed and included in sales and marketing expense when incurred, were $
1.7
 million, $
3.8
 million and $
3.8
 million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Research and Development Costs
The Company expenses research and development costs as incurred. Research and development expense consists primarily of expensed equipment for product development, personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, other professional costs and allocated facilities costs.
Stock-Based Compensation
Share-based payments are required to be recognized in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values and the estimated number of shares expected to vest. The Company measures stock-based compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, based on the estimated fair values on the date of the grant. The fair value of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) granted is determined based on the price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of non-market‑based performance stock units (“PSUs”) granted is determined based on the date of grant or when achievement of performance is probable. The fair value of market‑based performance stock units granted is determined using a Monte‑Carlo model based on the date of grant or when achievement of performance is probable.
Stock-based compensation for RSUs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Stock-based compensation for PSUs without market conditions is recognized when the performance condition is probable of being achieved, and then on a graded basis over the requisite service period. Stock-based compensation for PSUs with market conditions is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Additionally, the Company estimates its forfeiture rate annually based on historical experience and revises the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
Foreign Currency Translation
The Company and most of its subsidiaries use their respective local currency as their functional currency. Accordingly, foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period. Aggregate exchange gains and losses arising from the translation of foreign assets and liabilities are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders' equity. Foreign subsidiaries that use the U.S. 
Enphase Energy, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 82

NOTES TO  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period. In addition, transactions that are denominated in non-functional currency are remeasured using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period. Exchange gains and losses arising from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities are included in other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of operations. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are carried at their historical values.
Comprehensive Income 
Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to gains and losses that are recorded as an element of stockholders’ equity but are excluded from net income. The Company’s other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments and changes in net unrealized gain (loss) on marketable securities, net of tax.
Income Taxes
The Company records income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts recognized for income tax purposes. In estimating future tax consequences, generally all expected future events other than enactments or changes in the tax law or rates are considered. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
The Company assesses the realizability of the deferred tax assets to determine release of valuation allowance as necessary. In the event the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the Company would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should it be determined that additional amounts of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized in the future, an adjustment to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance will reduce income in the period such determination is made.
The Company operates in various tax jurisdictions and is subject to audit by various tax authorities. The Company follows accounting for uncertainty in income taxes which requires that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is “more likely than not” to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date. The Company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments, and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-07”). ASU 2023-07 requires additional disclosures for segment reporting, including disclosure of the title and position of the Chief Operating Decision Maker and requires a public entity that has a single reportable segment to provide all the disclosures required by the amendments in ASU 2023-07, and all existing segment disclosures in Topic 280. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 effective for its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 and subsequent interim periods. Since ASU 2023-07 addresses only disclosures, the adoption of ASU 2023-07 did not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
Not Yet Effective 
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-09”). ASU 2023-09 requires that an entity disclose specific categories in the effective tax rate reconciliation as well as provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold, certain disclosures of state versus federal income tax expenses and taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2023-09 to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements and will adopt the standard effective January 1, 2025.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
Acquisition of GreenCom Networks AG (“GreenCom”)
On October 10, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of GreenCom, a privately-held company, for paid cash consideration of approximately $
34.9
 million. GreenCom provided Internet of Things (IoT) software solutions for customers to connect and manage a wide range of distributed energy devices within the home. This acquisition added headcount to the Company’s engineering team in Europe to introduce the IQ Energy Router family of devices in Germany and Austria beginning in June 2023, which are designed to allow the integration of select third-party EV chargers and heat pumps into the Company’s solar and battery systems.
The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination under the acquisition method, and accordingly, the approximately $
34.9
 million purchase price is allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values on the acquisition date.
The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date (in thousands):

The excess of the consideration paid over the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed represents the goodwill resulting from the acquisition. Goodwill is primarily attributable to expected synergies in the Company’s solar offerings and cross-selling opportunities. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for German income tax purposes.

Changes in Estimates
On a quarterly basis, the Company uses the best and most complete underlying information available, following a consistent, systematic and rational methodology to determine its warranty obligations. The Company considers all available evidence to assess the reasonableness of all key assumptions underlying its estimated warranty obligations for each generation of microinverter. The changes in estimates discussed below resulted from consideration of new or additional information becoming available and subsequent developments. Changes in estimates included in the table above were comprised of the following:
2024
In 2024, the Company recorded $
1.1
 million in warranty expense from changes in estimates, of which $
10.2
 million related to the Company proactively addressing certain component defects in a specific population of products that did not meet the Company’s high quality standards, $
6.0
 million for continuing analysis of field performance data and diagnostic root-cause failure analysis primarily related to prior generation products, $
5.8
 million from increase in product replacement costs due to increase in freight costs as well as $
0.5
 million related to increasing the warranty term to 
20
 years for microinverter units sold in Mexico, Columbia, Panama, Costa Rica and 
nine
 Caribbean countries. This expense was partially offset by a benefit from $
17.0
 million related to a decrease in product replacement costs primarily associated with Enphase IQ Battery storage systems and related accessories as the Company expanded its network of field service technicians in the United States, Europe and Australia to provide direct homeowner assistance, and $
4.4
 million related to continuing analysis of field performance data and diagnostic root-cause failure analysis for early generations of the IQ Battery.
2023
In 2023, the Company recorded $
19.2
 million in warranty benefit from changes in estimates, of which $
27.3
 million related to a decrease in product replacement costs related to Enphase IQ Battery storage systems and accessories as the Company expanded its network of field service technicians in the United States, Europe and Australia to provide direct homeowner assistance, and $
8.8
 million related to a decrease in product replacement costs for all other products. This benefit was partially offset by $
8.6
 million related to the Company proactively addressing certain component defects in a specific population of products that did not meet the Company's high quality standards as well as continuing analysis of field performance data and diagnostic root-cause failure analysis primarily for prior generation products and $
8.3
 million for increasing the warranty period for the IQ Battery from 
10
 years to 
15
 years.

 million in warranty expense from changes in estimates, of which $
18.3
 million related to continuing analysis of field performance data and diagnostic root-cause failure analysis, primarily for IQ Battery storage systems and prior generation products, $
7.0

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
The accounting guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and risk of nonperformance.
The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. An asset’s or liability’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Three levels of inputs may be used to measure fair value:
•
Level 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company is able to access. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of such assets or liabilities do not entail a significant degree of judgment.
•
Level 2 - Valuations based on one or more quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
•
Level 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.

Notes due 2028, Notes due 2026 and Notes due 2025
The Company carries the Notes due 2028 (as defined in Note 13, “Debt”) and Notes due 2026 (as defined in Note 13, “Debt”) at face value less unamortized debt issuance costs on its consolidated balance sheets. The Company carries the Notes due 2025 (as defined in Note 13, “Debt”) at face value less unamortized debt discount and issuance costs on its consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2024, the fair value of the Notes due 2028, Notes due 2026 and Notes due 2025 was $
472.9
 million, $
593.8
 million and $
106.1
 million, respectively. The fair value as of December 31, 2024 was determined based on the closing trading price per $100 principal amount as of the last day of trading for the period. The Company considers the fair value of the Notes due 2028, Notes due 2026 and Notes due 2025 to be a Level 2 measurement as they are not actively traded. 
Equity investments without readily determinable fair value
The Company had previously invested $
6.0
 million in a privately-held company without a readily determinable fair value, which is included in “Other assets” in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company determined that the carrying value of the investment was not recoverable. Accordingly, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $
6.0
 million within “Other income, net” on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024.
Investments in debt securities
The Company had previously taken a non-voting participating interest of approximately $
15.0
 million in a loan held by a privately-held company, which is included in “Other assets” in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2024, the Company accreted interest of approximately $
2.0
 million in “Other income (expense), net” in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company determined that the 
Enphase Energy, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 93

NOTES TO  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
carrying value of the investment was not recoverable as the privately-held company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy during the year ended December 31, 2024. Accordingly, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $
17.0
 million within “Other income, net” on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024.
In July 2023, the Company invested approximately $
15.0
 million in a secured convertible promissory note issued by the stockholders of a privately-held company. The investment qualified as an investment in a debt security and will accrete interest. The principal plus accrued interest is payable upon maturity unless it is converted to equity at a pre-determined price. As the investment includes a conversion option, the Company has elected to account for this investment under the fair value option and any changes in fair value of the investment is recognized in “Other income (expense), net” in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations for that period. Principal plus accrued interest receivable of the investment approximates the fair value.
Investment in debt securities is recorded in “Other assets” on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
The changes in the balance in investments in debt securities during the period were as follows:

Warranty obligations
Fair Value Option for Warranty Obligations Related to Products Sold Since January 1, 2014 
The Company estimates the fair value of warranty obligations by calculating the warranty obligations in the same manner as for sales prior to January 1, 2014 and applying an expected present value technique to that result. The expected present value technique, an income approach, converts future amounts into a single current discounted amount. In addition to the key estimates of return rates and replacement costs, the Company used certain Level 3 inputs, which are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. Such additional assumptions are based on the Company’s credit-adjusted risk-free rate (“discount rate”) and compensation comprised of a profit element and risk premium required of a market participant to assume the obligation.

Quantitative and Qualitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements
As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company’s liabilities designated as Level 3 were as follows, of which the monetary impact for change in discount rate is captured in “Change in discount rate” in the table above:

Sensitivity of Level 3 Inputs - Warranty Obligations
Each of the significant unobservable inputs is independent of the other. The profit element and risk premium are estimated based on the requirements of a third-party participant willing to assume the Company’s warranty obligations. The discount rate is determined by reference to the Company’s own credit standing at the fair value measurement date, which insignificantly declined during the year December 31, 2024 contributing to a $
0.5
 million warranty benefit, as compared to same period in 2023 when it improved contributing to the $
44.4
 million warranty expense, both captured in “Change in discount rate” in the table above. Under the expected present value technique, increasing the profit element and risk premium input by 100 basis points would result in a $
1.2
 million increase to the liability. Decreasing the profit element and risk premium by 100 basis points would result in a $
1.2
 million reduction to the liability. Increasing the discount rate by 100 basis points would result in a $
11.6
 million decrease to the liability. Decreasing the discount rate by 100 basis points would result in a $
13.1
 million increase to the liability.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The initial conversion rate for the Notes due 2028 is 3.5104 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes due 2028 (which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $
284.87
 per share). Upon conversion, the Company will settle conversions of the Notes due 2028 through payment or delivery, as the case may be, of cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at the Company’s election.
The Company may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes due 2028, at the Company’s election, on or after September 6, 2024, if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock has been greater than or equal to 
130
% of the conversion price then in effect for the Notes due 2028 (
i.e.,
 $
370.33
, which is 
130
% of the current conversion price for the Notes due 2028) for at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 
30
 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption. The redemption price will equal 
100
% of the principal amount of the Notes due 2028 to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any to, but excluding, the relevant redemption date. No sinking fund is provided for the Notes due 2028.
The Notes due 2028 may be converted on any day prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding September 1, 2027, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at the option of the holder only under any of the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on June 30, 2021 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock for at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 
30
 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 
130
% of the conversion price for the Notes due 2028 on each applicable trading day; (2) during the 
five
 business day period after any 
five
 consecutive trading day period (the “Measurement Period”) in which the “trading price” (as defined in the relevant indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the Measurement Period was less than 
98
% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock and the conversion rate for the Notes due 2028 on each such trading day; (3) if the Company calls any or all of the Notes due 2028 for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On and after September 1, 2027 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of March 1, 2028, holders of the Notes due 2028 may convert their notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the relevant indenture), holders may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes due 2028 for cash at a price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.
As of December 31, 2024, the sales price of the Company’s common stock was not greater than or equal to $
370.33
 (
130
% of the notes conversion price) for at least 
20
 trading days (whether consecutive or not) during a period of 
30
 consecutive trading days preceding the quarter-ended December 31, 2024. As a result, the Notes due 2028 are not convertible at the holders’ option through December 31, 2024. Accordingly, the Company classified the net carrying amount of the Notes due 2028 of $
570.9
 million as Debt, non-current on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, the unamortized deferred issuance cost for the Notes due 2028 was $
4.1
 million on the consolidated balance sheet.
Notes due 2028 Hedge and Warrant Transactions
In connection with the offering of the Notes due 2028, the Company entered into privately-negotiated convertible note hedge transactions (“Notes due 2028 Hedge”) pursuant to which the Company has the option to purchase a total of approximately 
2.0
 million shares of its common stock (subject to anti-dilution adjustments), which is the same number of shares initially issuable upon conversion of the Notes due 2028, at a price of $
284.87
 per share. The total cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was approximately $
161.6
 million. The convertible note hedge transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to the Company’s common stock upon any conversion of the Notes due 2028 and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be.
Additionally, the Company separately entered into privately-negotiated warrant transactions (the “2028 Warrants”) whereby the Company sold warrants to acquire approximately 
2.0
 million shares of the Company’s common stock (subject to anti-dilution adjustments) at an initial strike price of $
397.91
 per share. The Company 
Enphase Energy, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 99
Table 
of Contents

ENPHASE ENERGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
received aggregate proceeds of approximately $
123.4
 million from the sale of the 2028 Warrants. If the market value per share of the Company’s common stock, as measured under the 2028 Warrants, exceeds the strike price of the 2028 Warrants, the 2028 Warrants will have a dilutive effect on the Company’s earnings per share, unless the Company elects, subject to certain conditions, to settle the 2028 Warrants in cash. Taken together, the purchase of the Notes due 2028 Hedge and the sale of the 2028 Warrants are intended to reduce potential dilution from the conversion of the Notes due 2028 and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from $
284.87
 to $
397.91
 per share. The 2028 Warrants are only exercisable on the applicable expiration dates in accordance with the Notes due 2028 Hedge. Subject to the other terms of the 2028 Warrants, the first expiration date applicable to the Notes due 2028 Hedge is June 1, 2028, and the final expiration date applicable to the Notes due 2028 Hedge is July 27, 2028.
Given that the transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the Notes due 2028 Hedge and the 2028 Warrants transactions are recorded in stockholders’ equity, and they are not accounted for as derivatives and are not remeasured each reporting period.
Convertible Senior Notes due 2026
On March 1, 2021, the Company issued $
575.0
 million aggregate principal amount of 
0.0
% convertible senior notes due 2026 (the “Notes due 2026”). In addition, on March 12, 2021, the Company issued an additional $
57.5
 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes due 2026 pursuant to the initial purchasers’ full exercise of the over-allotment option for additional Notes due 2026. The Notes due 2026 will not bear regular interest, and the principal amount of the Notes due 2026 will not accrete. The Notes due 2026 are general unsecured obligations and are governed by an indenture between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The Notes due 2026 will mature on March 1, 2026, unless repurchased earlier by the Company or converted at the option of the holders. The Company received approximately $
623.0
 million in net proceeds, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discount, from the issuance of the Notes due 2026.
The initial conversion rate for the Notes due 2026 is 3.2523 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes due 2026 (which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $
307.47
 per share). Upon conversion, the Company will settle conversions of Notes due 2026 through payment or delivery, as the case may be, of cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at the Company’s election.
The Company may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes due 2026, at the Company’s election, on or after September 6, 2023, if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock has been greater than or equal to 
130
% of the conversion price then in effect for the Notes due 2026 (
i.e
., $
399.71
, which is 
130
% of the current conversion price for the Notes due 2026) for at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 
30
 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption. The redemption price will equal 
100
% of the principal amount of the Notes due 2026 to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the relevant redemption date for the Notes due 2026. The redemption price will be increased as described in the relevant indentures by a number of additional shares of the Company in connection with such optional redemption by the Company. No sinking fund is provided for the Notes due 2026.
The Notes due 2026 may be converted on any day prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding September 1, 2025, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at the option of the holder only under any of the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on June 30, 2021 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock for at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 
30
 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 
130
% of the conversion price of the Notes due 2026 on each applicable trading day; (2) during the 
five
 business day period after any 
five
 consecutive trading day period (the “measurement period”) in which the “trading price” (as defined in the relevant indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 
98
% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock and the conversion rate for Notes due 2026 on each such trading day; (3) if the Company calls any or all of the Notes due 2026 for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On and after

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
September 1, 2025 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of March 1, 2026, holders of the Notes due 2026 may convert their notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the relevant indenture), holders may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes due 2026 for cash at a price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.
As of December 31, 2024, the sale price of the Company’s common stock was not greater than or equal to $
399.71
 (
130
% of the notes conversion price) for at least 
20
 trading days (whether consecutive or not) during a period of 
30
 consecutive trading days preceding the quarter-ended December 31, 2024. As a result, the Notes due 2026 are not convertible at the holders’ option through December 31, 2024. Accordingly, the Company classified the net carrying amount of the Notes due 2026 of $
630.2
 million as Debt, non-current on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, the unamortized deferred issuance cost for the Notes due 2026 was $
2.3
 million on the consolidated balance sheet.
Notes due 2026 Hedge and Warrant Transactions
In connection with the offering of the Notes due 2026 (including in connection with the issuance of additional Notes due 2026 upon the initial purchasers’ exercise of their over-allotment option), the Company entered into privately-negotiated convertible note hedge transactions (the “Notes due 2026 Hedge”) pursuant to which the Company has the option to purchase a total of approximately 
2.1
 million shares of its common stock (subject to anti-dilution adjustments), which is the same number of shares initially issuable upon conversion of the Notes due 2026, at a price of $
307.47
 per share, which is the initial conversion price of the Notes due 2026. The total cost of the Notes due 2026 Hedge was approximately $
124.6
 million. The Notes due 2026 Hedge are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to the Company’s common stock upon any conversion of the Notes due 2026 and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be.
Additionally, the Company separately entered into privately-negotiated warrant transactions, including in connection with the issuance of additional Notes due 2026 upon the initial purchasers’ exercise of their over-allotment option (the “2026 Warrants”), whereby the Company sold warrants to acquire approximately 
2.1
 million shares of the Company’s common stock (subject to anti-dilution adjustments) at an initial strike price of $
397.91
 per share. The Company received aggregate proceeds of approximately $
97.4
 million from the sale of the 2026 Warrants. If the market value per share of the Company’s common stock, as measured under the 2026 Warrants, exceeds the strike price of the 2026 Warrants, the 2026 Warrants will have a dilutive effect on the Company’s earnings per share, unless the Company elects, subject to certain conditions, to settle the 2026 Warrants in cash. Taken together, the purchase of the Notes due 2026 Hedge and the sale of the 2026 Warrants are intended to reduce potential dilution from the conversion of the Notes due 2026 and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from $
307.47
 to $
397.91
 per share. The 2026 Warrants are only exercisable on the applicable expiration dates in accordance with the 2026 Warrants. Subject to the other terms of the 2026 Warrants, the first expiration date applicable to the Warrants is June 1, 2026, and the final expiration date applicable to the 2026 Warrants is July 27, 2026.
Given that the transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the Notes due 2026 Hedge and the 2026 Warrants transactions are recorded in stockholders’ equity, and they are not accounted for as derivatives and are not remeasured each reporting period.
Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 
On March 9, 2020, the Company issued $
320.0
 million aggregate principal amount of its 
0.25
% convertible senior notes due 2025 (the “Notes due 2025”). The Notes due 2025 are general unsecured obligations and bear interest at an annual rate of 
0.25
% per year, payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 of each year. The Notes due 2025 are governed by an indenture between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The Notes due 2025 will mature on March 1, 2025, unless earlier repurchased by the Company or converted at the option of the holders. The Company may not redeem the notes prior to the maturity date, and no sinking fund is provided for the notes. The Notes due 2025 may be converted, under certain circumstances as described below, based on an initial conversion rate of 12.2637 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount (which represents an initial conversion price of $
81.54
 per share). The conversion rate for the Notes due

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2025 will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events but will not be adjusted for accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, upon the occurrence of a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the relevant indenture), the Company will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate by a number of additional shares for a holder that elects to convert its notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change. The Company received approximately $
313.0
 million in net proceeds, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discount, from the issuance of the Notes due 2025.
The Notes due 2025 may be converted prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding September 1, 2024, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at the option of the holder only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on June 30, 2020 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock for at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 
30
 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 
130
% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the 
five
 business day period after any 
five
 consecutive trading day period (the “measurement period”) in which the “trading price” (as defined in the relevant indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 
98
% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On and after September 1, 2024 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of March 1, 2025, holders may convert their notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. These conversions will be settled in a combination settlement method with the principal value settled in cash and the remaining value in shares of the Company’s common stock. Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the relevant indenture), holders may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes due 2025 for cash at a price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. 
As the Notes due 2025 mature in less than a year, the Company classified the net carrying amount of the Notes due 2025 of $
101.3
 million as Debt, current on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024. 
Partial repurchase of Notes due 2025
On June 5, 2024, the Company received a request for conversion of $
5,000
 in the principal amount of the Notes due 2025. In July 2024, the principal amount of the converted Notes due 2025 was repaid in cash. In connection with the conversion, the Company also issued 
16
 shares of its common stock to the holders of the converted Notes due 2025, with an aggregate fair value of less than $
0.1
 million, representing the conversion value in excess of the principal amount of the Notes due 2025. These shares were offset by 
14
 shares the Company received from the corresponding exercise of the notes hedge.
On December 29, 2023, the Company received a request for conversion of $
2,000
 in the principal amount of the Notes due 2025. In February 2024, the principal amount of the converted Notes due 2025 was repaid in cash. In connection with the conversion, the Company also issued 
six
 shares of its common stock to the holders of the converted Notes due 2025, with an aggregate fair value of less than $
0.1
 million, representing the conversion value in excess of the principal amount of the Notes due 2025. Following the repurchase combined with repurchase in previous years, as of December 31, 2023, $
102.2
 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes due 2025 remained outstanding.
The derived effective interest rate on the Notes due 2025 host contract was determined to be 
5.18
%, which remains unchanged from the date of issuance. The remaining unamortized debt discount was $
0.8
 million as of December 31, 2024, and will be amortized over approximately 
0.2
 years from December 31, 2024.
Notes due 2025 Hedge and Warrant Transactions
In connection with the offering of the Notes due 2025, the Company entered into privately-negotiated convertible note hedge transactions (the “Notes due 2025 Hedge”) pursuant to which the Company has the option to purchase a total of approximately 
3.9
 million shares of its common stock (subject to anti-dilution adjustments), which is the same number of shares initially issuable upon conversion of the notes, at a price of $
81.54
 per share, which is the initial conversion price of the Notes due 2025. The total cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was approximately $
89.1
 million. The convertible note hedge transactions are expected generally to reduce

potential dilution to the Company’s common stock upon any conversion of the Notes due 2025 and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be.
Additionally, the Company separately entered into privately-negotiated warrant transactions in connection with the offering of the Notes due 2025 whereby the Company sold the 2025 Warrants to acquire approximately 
3.9
 million shares of the Company’s common stock (subject to anti-dilution adjustments) at an initial strike price of $
106.94
 per share. The Company received aggregate proceeds of approximately $
71.6
 million from the sale of the 2025 Warrants. If the market value per share of the Company’s common stock, as measured under the 2025 Warrants, exceeds the strike price of the 2025 Warrants, the 2025 Warrants will have a dilutive effect on the Company’s earnings per share, unless the Company elects, subject to certain conditions, to settle the 2025 Warrants in cash. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges in connection with the Notes due 2025 Hedge and the sale of the 2025 Warrants are intended to reduce potential dilution from the conversion of the Notes due 2025 and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from $
81.54
 to $
106.94
 per share. The 2025 Warrants are only exercisable on the applicable expiration dates in accordance with the agreements relating to each of the 2025 Warrants. Subject to the other terms of the 2025 Warrants, the first expiration date applicable to the 2025 Warrants is June 1, 2025, and the final expiration date applicable to the 2025 Warrants is September 23, 2025.
As of December 31, 2024, options to purchase approximately 
1.3
 million shares of common stock remained outstanding under the Notes due 2025 Hedge, and 2025 Warrants exercisable to purchase approximately 
1.3
 million shares remained outstanding.
Given that the transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the Notes due 2025 Hedge and the 2025 Warrants transactions are recorded in stockholders’ equity, and they are not accounted for as derivatives and are not remeasured each reporting period.

Purchase Obligations
The Company has contractual obligations related to component inventory that its contract manufacturers procure on its behalf in accordance with its production forecast as well as other inventory related purchase commitments. As of December 31, 2024, these purchase obligations totaled approximately $
130.9
 million.
Litigation
The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved. An accrual for a loss contingency or loss recovery is recognized when it is probable and the amount of loss or recovery can be reasonably estimated. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.
On July 17, 2024, Zola Electric International, Ltd. (“Zola”) filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against us, alleging breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing related to a joint development agreement and master supply agreement between Zola and the Company. On September 19, 2024, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, and all briefing papers were filed with the Court on or before November 8, 2024. The Company entered into a settlement and mutual release agreement with Zola on November 25, 2024 and Zola filed a stipulation of dismissal with prejudice on December 3, 2024, which was entered by the Court on December 4, 2024.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
2011 Plan
Under the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2011 Plan”), the Company could initially issue up to 
2,643,171
 shares of its common stock pursuant to stock options, stock appreciation rights (“SARS”), restricted stock awards (“RSA”), RSUs, PSUs, and other forms of equity compensation, or collectively, stock awards, all of which may be granted to employees, including officers, and to non-employee directors and consultants. Options granted under the 2011 Plan before August 1, 2012 generally expire 
10
 years after the grant date and options granted thereafter generally expire 
seven years
 after the grant date. Equity awards granted under the 2011 Plan generally vested over a 
four year
 period from the date of grant based on continued service to the Company. As of May 19, 2021, no further stock options or other stock awards may be granted under the 2011 Plan. 
2021 Plan
On May 19, 2021, at the 2021 annual meeting of stockholders of the Company, the stockholders approved the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”), as the successor to the 2011 Plan. The 2021 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, SARS, RSAs, RSUs, PSUs and other forms of equity compensation. Eligible participants under the 2021 Plan include Company’s employees, directors and consultants. The 2021 Plan provides, among other things, that the number of shares of the Company’s common stock, $
0.00001
 par value per share, reserved for issuance under the 2021 Plan (subject to adjustment for certain changes in the Company’s capitalization) is equal to: (A) the sum of (i) 
9,100,456
 newly reserved shares of the Company’s common stock and (ii) 
5,256,517
 Returning Shares (as defined below) as such shares become available from time to time as set forth in the 2021 Plan. “Returning Shares” means shares subject to any outstanding award granted under the 2011 Plan (“Prior Plan Award”) that are (i) not issued because such Prior Plan Award or any portion thereof expires or otherwise terminates without all of the shares covered by such Prior Plan Award having been issued, or is settled in cash; (ii) forfeited back to or repurchased by the Company because of a failure to vest; or (iii) reacquired or withheld (or not issued) by the Company to satisfy the purchase price of, or a tax withholding obligation in connection with, a Prior Plan Award that is a Full Value Award (as defined in the 2021 Plan). As of December 31, 2024, 
4,908,854
 shares remained available for issuance under the 2021 Plan.
2011 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The 2011 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) became effective immediately upon the execution and delivery of the underwriting agreement for the Company’s initial public offering on March 29, 2012. The ESPP authorized the issuance of 
669,603
 shares of the Company’s common stock pursuant to purchase rights granted to employees. The number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance will automatically increase, on each January 1, by a lesser of (i) 
700,000
 shares of the Company’s common stock or (ii) 
1.0
% of the total number of shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding on December 31 of the preceding calendar year, as determined by the Company’s board of directors. In 2022, the Company’s board of directors waived the automatic increase of 
700,000
 shares that were to be added on January 1, 2023 for issuance under the 2011 ESPP plan and 
Enphase Energy, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 105
Table 
of Contents

ENPHASE ENERGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
no
 additional shares were added to the plan on January 1, 2023. As of December 31, 2024, 
2,352,769
 shares remained available for future issuance under the ESPP. On January 1, 2025, the shares available for issuance under the ESPP automatically increased by 
700,000
 shares.
The ESPP is implemented by concurrent offering periods and each offering period may contain up to 
four
 interim purchase periods. In general, offering periods consist of the 
24-month
 periods commencing on each May 15 and November 15 of a calendar year.
Generally, all full-time employees in the United States and certain other countries in which the Company operates, including executive officers, are eligible to participate in the ESPP. The ESPP permits eligible employees to purchase the Company’s common stock through payroll deductions, which may not exceed 
15
% of the employee’s total compensation subject to certain limits. Stock may be purchased under the plan at a price equal to 
85
% of the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on either the date of purchase or the first day of an offering period, whichever is lower. A 
two‑year
 look-back feature in the Company’s ESPP causes an offering period to reset if the fair value of the Company’s common stock on a purchase date is less than that on the initial offering date for that offering period. The reset feature, when triggered, will be accounted for as a modification to the original offering, resulting in additional expense to be recognized over the 
24-month
 period of the new offering. During any calendar year, participants may not purchase shares of the Company’s common stock having a value greater than $
25,000
, based on the fair market value per share of the Company’s common stock at the beginning of an offering period.
Valuation of Equity Awards
Stock Options
No
 stock options were granted during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.
Restricted Stock Units
The fair value of the Company’s RSU awards granted is based upon the closing price of the Company’s stock price on the date of grant.
Performance Stock Units
The fair value of the Company’s non-market PSU awards granted was based upon the closing price of the Company’s stock price on the date of grant. The fair value of awards of the Company’s PSU awards containing market conditions was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model based upon the terms of the conditions, the expected volatility of the underlying security, and other relevant factors.
Stock-based Compensation Expense
Stock-based compensation expense for all stock-based awards, which includes shares purchased under the Company’s ESPP, RSUs and PSUs, expected to vest is measured at fair value on the date of grant and recognized ratably over the requisite service period.
In addition, as part of certain business acquisitions, the Company was obligated to issue shares of common stock of the Company as payment subject to achievement of certain targets. For such payments, the Company recorded stock-based compensation classified as post-combination expense recognized ratably over the measurement period presuming the targets will be met.

As of December 31, 2024, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $
2.0
 million against certain of its net operating losses on one of its foreign operations, as it is more likely than not that such amounts will not be fully realized.
The Company's accounting for deferred taxes involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the realizability of the Company's deferred tax assets. Assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets is dependent upon several factors, including the likelihood and amount, if any, of future taxable income in relevant jurisdictions during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. The Company's management forecasts taxable income by considering all available positive and negative evidence including its history of operating income or losses and its financial plans and estimates which are used to manage the business. These assumptions require significant judgment about future taxable income. 
The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income are reduced.

ENPHASE ENERGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
As of December 31, 2024, the Company evaluated its undistributed foreign earnings and identified $
79.2
 million in earnings that it does not consider to be permanently reinvested that may be subject to withholding taxes in local jurisdictions when they are distributed. The Company has recorded a provision of approximately $
6.8
 million for the taxes that would fall due when such earnings are repatriated.
The Company has approximately $
6.0
 million of federal tax credit and $
10.3
 million of state tax credit carryforwards. The federal credits begin to expire in 2031 and the state credits can be carried forward indefinitely. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has foreign net operating losses of $
5.3
 million from the acquisition of GreenCom, which can be carried over indefinitely.
Utilization of some of the federal credit carryforwards and state net operating loss and credit carryforwards are subject to annual limitations due to the “change in ownership” provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and similar state provisions. The Company believes that no such change has occurred through December 31, 2024.
Accounting for uncertain tax positions prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company is required to recognize in the financial statements the impact of a tax position, if that position is more-likely than-not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company recorded a net charge for unrecognized tax benefits in 2024 of $
0.4
 million.
The Company does not have any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease over the next year. The unrecognized tax benefits may increase or change during the next year for items that arise in the ordinary course of business.
As of December 31, 2024, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $
27.7
 million, of which $
26.0
 million, if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate.

The Company includes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax provision. In the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $
6.1
 million, $
2.9
 million and $
0.8
 million, respectively. Both the unrecognized tax benefits and the associated interest and penalties that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year are classified as other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. In connection with tax matters, the Company’s interest and penalty expense recognized in 2024, 2023 and 2022 in the consolidated statements of operations was $
2.3
 million, $
3.8
 million and $
0.9
 million, respectively.
The Company’s tax returns continue to remain effectively subject to examination by U.S. federal authorities for the years 2006 and onwards and by California state authorities for the years 2006 and onwards due to use and carryovers of net operating losses and tax credits. The Company is currently under audit in India and it is reasonably possible that its existing gross unrecognized tax benefits may be reduced by up to $
5.1
 million within the next 12 months.
In August 2022, the U.S. enacted the IRA, which included revisions to the Code. The IRA introduced a 15% corporate alternative minimum income tax (“CAMT”) for corporations whose average adjusted financial income for any consecutive three-year period ending after December 31, 2021, exceeds $1.0 billion. Further, the IRA also extended the investment tax credits for clean energy and expanded the incentives to clean energy manufacturing.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company is not subject to the CAMT based on its current operating results and interpretations of the latest IRA guidance. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, benefits recognized from the AMPTC of $
157.5
 million and $
53.5
 million, respectively, were recorded as a prepaid income tax of $

 million (included in Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets) and reduction of income tax payable of $
62.7
 million on the consolidated balance sheet for the year ended December 31, 2024, reduction to income tax payable of $

157.5
 million and $
53.5
 million on the consolidated statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
In December 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion Profit Shifting released Model Global Anti-Base Erosion rules (“Model Rules”) under Pillar Two. The Model Rules set forth the “common approach” for a Global Minimum Tax at 15 percent for multinational enterprises with a turnover of more than 750 million euros. Rules under Pillar Two were effective from January 1, 2024. The adoption of Pillar Two rules did not have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements in 2024.
18.    
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK AND MAJOR CUSTOMERS
The Company is potentially subject to financial instrument concentration of credit risk through its cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable securities and accounts receivable. The Company places its cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities with high quality institutions and performs periodic evaluations of their relative credit standing.
Accounts receivable can be potentially exposed to a concentration of credit risk with its major customers. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, amounts due from one customer represented approximately 
43
% and 
40
%, respectively, of the total accounts receivable balance.
In the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, one customer accounted for approximately 
48
%, 
40
% and 
37
%, respectively, of our net revenues.

19.    
NET INCOME PER SHARE
Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed in a similar manner, but it also includes the effect of potential common shares outstanding during the period, when dilutive.

Diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2024 includes the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive common shares by application of the treasury stock method for stock options, RSUs, PSUs, ESPP, Notes due 2025, and includes potentially dilutive common shares by application of the if-converted method for the Notes due 2026 and Notes due 2028. Potentially dilutive common shares for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 include stock options, RSUs, PSUs, ESPP, Notes due 2023, Notes due 2025, Notes due 2026, Notes due 2028 and the 2025 Warrants. To the extent these potential common shares are antidilutive, they are excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per share.
Further, the Company under the relevant sections of the indentures, irrevocably may elect to settle principal in cash and any excess in cash or shares of the Company’s common stock for the Notes due 2026 and Notes due 2028. If and when the Company makes such election, there will be no adjustment to the net income and the Company will use the average share price for the period to determine the potential number of shares to be issued based upon assumed conversion to be included in the diluted share count.
Holders of the Notes due 2025 may now convert their notes at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of March 1, 2025. These conversions will be settled in a combination settlement method with the principal value settled in cash and the remaining value in shares of the Company’s common stock, as a result there was no adjustment to the net income for the year ended December 31, 2024, and the Company used the average share price for the period to determine the potential number of shares that will be issued and included in the diluted share count for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We carried out an evaluation required by the Exchange Act, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act, as of December 31, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria set forth in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013). As a result of this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was effective. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent year ended December 31, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
Limitations on Controls
Our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives as specified above. Management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected by us.
