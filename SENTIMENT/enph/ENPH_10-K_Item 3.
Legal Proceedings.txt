These forward-looking statements are contained principally in Part I, Item 1, Business; Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors; Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; and other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and you should not place undue reliance on these statements, which speak only as of the date that they were made. These cautionary statements should be considered in connection with any written or oral forward-looking statements that we may issue in the future. We do not undertake any obligation to release publicly any revisions to these forward-looking statements after completion of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K to reflect later events or circumstances or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

Risk Factors Summary
Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. The following is a summary of the principal factors that make an investment in our securities speculative or risky, as more fully described below in the section titled “Risk Factors.” This summary should be read in conjunction with the “Risk Factors” section and should not be relied upon as an exhaustive summary of the material risks facing our business. In addition to this summary, you should consider the information set forth in the “Risk Factors” section and the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before investing in our securities:
Risk Related to our Business, Operations and Our Industry
•
The reduction, elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for on-grid solar electricity applications could reduce demand for solar photovoltaic systems and harm our business.
•
Unfavorable macroeconomic and market conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and financial results.
•
If demand for solar energy solutions does not grow or grows at a slower rate than we anticipate, our business will suffer.
•
The solar industry is highly competitive, and we expect to face increased competition as new and existing competitors introduce products or develop alternative technologies.
•
Our recent and planned expansion into existing and new markets could subject us to additional business, financial and competitive risks.
•
We may fail to capture customers as we design and develop new products, and update existing products.
•
We depend upon a small number of outside contract manufacturers, and our business and operations could be disrupted if we encounter problems with these contract manufacturers.
•
We rely primarily on distributors, installers and providers of solar financing to assist in selling our products to customers, and the failure of these customers to perform at the expected level, or at all, would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of our operations.
•
We depend on limited-source suppliers for key components and products. If we are unable to source these components and products on a timely basis, we will not be able to deliver our products to our customers.
•
If we or our contract manufacturers are unable to obtain raw materials in a timely manner or if the price of raw materials increases significantly, production time and product costs could increase, which may adversely affect our business.
•
Manufacturing problems could result in delays in product shipments, which would adversely affect our revenue, competitive position and reputation.
•
Challenges relating to supply chain constraints, including with respect to raw materials, semiconductors and integrated circuits, could adversely impact our revenue, gross margins and results of operations.
•
The loss of, or events affecting, one of our major customers could reduce our sales and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
•
If our products contain manufacturing or software defects, our business and financial results could be harmed.
•
If we fail to retain our key personnel or if we fail to attract additional qualified personnel, we may not be able to achieve our anticipated level of growth and our business could suffer.
•
Restructuring activities could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operations.

Risk Related to our Intellectual Property and Technology
•
We are dependent on information technology systems, infrastructure and data. We or third parties upon which we rely could be subject to breaches of our information technology systems caused by system security risks, failure of our data protection, cyber-attacks and erroneous or non-malicious actions or failures to act by our employees or others with authorized access to our networks, which could cause significant reputational, legal and financial damages.
•
The software we use in providing system configuration recommendations or potential energy savings estimates to customers relies in part on third-party information that may not be accurate or up-to-date; this may therefore generate inaccurate recommendations or estimates, resulting in a loss of reputation and customer confidence.
•
We are subject to stringent and evolving data privacy and security laws, contractual obligations, information security policies and other obligations governing the use, processing and transfer of personal information and any unauthorized access to, or disclosure or theft of personal information we gather, store or use could harm our reputation and subject us to claims or litigation.
•
If we fail to protect, or incur significant costs in enforcing, our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, our business and results of operations could be materially harmed.
•
We may be subject to disruptions or failures in information technology systems and network infrastructures that could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
•
Third parties may assert that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights, which could divert management’s attention, cause us to incur significant costs, and prevent us from selling or using the technology to which such rights relate.
Risk Related to Legal Proceedings and Regulations
•
Changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws or regulations, or new interpretations thereof, in the solar energy sector, by federal or state agencies in the United States or foreign jurisdictions could impair our ability to compete, and could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
•
Changes in the United States trade environment, including the recent imposition of import tariffs, could adversely affect the amount or timing of our revenue, results of operations or cash flows.
•
Our significant international operations subject us to additional risks that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Risk Related to our Financial Condition and Liquidity
•
Our gross profit may fluctuate over time, which could impair our ability to achieve or maintain profitability.
•
We are under continuous pressure to reduce the prices of our products, which has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our gross margins.
•
If we do not forecast demand for our products accurately, we may experience product shortages, delays in product shipment or excess product inventory, any of which will adversely affect our business and financial condition.
•
A drop in the retail price of electricity derived from the utility grid or from alternative energy sources, or a change in utility pricing structures, may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Risk Related to our Acquisition Activity
•
As part of growing our business, we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions. If we fail to successfully select, execute or integrate our acquisitions, then our business and operating results could be harmed.
Risk Related to our Debt and Equity Securities
•
Our financial results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors.
•
Conversion of our Convertible Notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders or may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.
