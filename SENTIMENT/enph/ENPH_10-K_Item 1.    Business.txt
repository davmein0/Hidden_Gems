Our Company
We are a global energy technology company originally founded in March 2006. We deliver smart, easy-to-use solutions that manage solar generation, storage and communication on one platform. Our intelligent microinverters work with virtually every solar panel made, and when paired with our smart technology, result in one of the industry’s best-performing clean energy systems. 
For the first time in the evolution of our centuries-old grid, people can get paid for the clean energy they produce and share with their communities, helping to build a new energy future that harnesses the sun. This clean, free, abundant source of energy can power our lives and ultimately help greatly reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. As of 
December 31
, 2024
, we have shipped approximately 80.0 million microinverters, and approximately 4.7 million Enphase residential and commercial systems have been deployed in more than 160 countries.
We design, develop, manufacture and sell home energy solutions that manage energy generation, energy storage, and control and communications on one intelligent platform. We have revolutionized the solar industry by bringing a systems approach to solar technology and by pioneering a semiconductor-based microinverter that converts energy at the individual solar module level and, combined with our proprietary networking and software technologies, provides advanced energy monitoring and control. This is vastly different than a string inverter system using string modules, whether with or without an optimizer, which only converts the energy of the entire array of solar modules from a single high voltage electrical unit and lacks intelligence about the energy producing capacity of the solar array.
The Enphase

local manufacturing and product content.
In an installation consisting of a traditional central inverter, the solar PV modules are connected in series strings. In a large installation, there are multiple series strings connected in parallel. The aggregated voltage from each of these strings is then fed into a large central inverter. We believe that traditional string inverters have a number of design and performance challenges limiting innovation and their ability to reduce the cost of solar power systems, including the following:
•
Productivity limits
. If solar modules are wired using a traditional central inverter—a group or “string” of modules are wired in series, and an entire string’s output is limited by the output of the lowest-performing module. Because of its string design, there is a single point of failure risk with the traditional string inverter approach.
•
Reli
a
bility issues
. Traditional string inverters are the single most common component of solar installations to fail, resulting in system downtime and adversely impacting total energy output. As a result, string inverters typically carry warranties of only 5 to 12 years.
•
Complex design and installation requirements
. The string inverter-based solar PV installation requires greater effort on the part of the installer, both in terms of design and on-site labor. String inverter installations require string design and calculations for safe and reliable operation, as well as specialized equipment such as DC combiners, conduits and disconnects. In addition, the use of high-voltage DC requires specialized knowledge and training and safety precautions to install string inverter technology.
•
Safety issues
. String inverter solar PV installations have a wide distribution of high-voltage (600 volts to 1,000 volts) DC wiring. If damaged, DC wires can generate sustained electrical arcs, reaching temperatures of more than 5,000°F. This creates the risk of fire for solar PV installation owners and injury for installers and maintenance personnel.
These challenges of traditional string inverters have a direct impact on the cost and expected return on investment of solar installations to both installers and system owners:
•
Installer
. Solar PV installers aim for simple installation design, fast installation times and maximum system performance and predictability. The installation of high-voltage DC string inverter technology, however, requires significant preparation, precautionary safety measures, time-consuming string calculations, extensive design expertise and specialized installation equipment, training and knowledge. Together, these factors significantly increase complexity and cost of installation and limit overall productivity for the installer.
•
System owner
. Solar power system owners aim for high energy production, low cost, high reliability, and low maintenance requirements, as well as reduced fire risks. With traditional string inverters, owners often are unable to optimize the size or shape of their solar PV installations due to string design limitations. As such, they experience performance loss from shading and other obstructions, can face frequent system failures and lack the ability to effectively monitor the performance of their solar PV installation. In addition, string inverter installations operate at high-voltage DC, which bears significant fire risks. Further, due to their large size, string inverter installations can affect architectural aesthetics of the house or commercial building.
Several of our existing and potential competitors are significantly larger than us and may have greater financial, marketing, distribution and customer support resources and may have significantly broader brand recognition, especially in certain markets. In addition, some of our competitors have more resources and experience in developing or acquiring new products and technologies and in creating market awareness for these offerings.
Competitors in the inverter market include, among others, SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (“SolarEdge”), Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., (“Huawei”), Tesla, Inc. (“Tesla”), Sungrow Power Supply Co., Ltd., Growatt New Energy Co., Ltd and other companies offering microinverters and/or string inverters with and without solar optimizers. We believe that our microinverter solutions offer significant advantages and competitive differentiation relative to traditional central or string inverter technology, even when supplemented by DC-to-DC optimizers on the roof.
Competitors in the storage market include Tesla, SolarEdge, Huawei, BYD, Franklin Solar Battery and other producers of battery cells and integrated storage systems. Competitors in the EV charger market include Wallbox, ChargePoint Holdings, Inc., Tesla, JuiceBox and EVBox, among others.

Manufacturing, Quality Control and Supply Chain Management
We utilize a sourcing strategy that emphasizes global procurement of materials and product manufacturing in lower cost regions. We outsource the manufacturing of our products to third-party contract manufacturers. Flex Ltd. and affiliates (“Flex”), Salcomp Plc. and affiliates (“Salcomp”), and Sunwoda Electric Co. Ltd. (“Sunwoda”) to assemble and test our IQ microinverters, IQ Battery storage systems, EV chargers and IQ Gateway products. Prices for such services are agreed to by the parties on a quarterly basis, and we are obligated to purchase manufactured products and raw materials that cannot be resold upon the termination of the corresponding agreement. Flex also provides receiving, kitting, storage, transportation, inventory visibility and other value-added logistics services at locations managed by Flex. In addition, we rely on several unaffiliated companies to supply certain components used in the fabrication of our products.
Our relationships with Flex and Salcomp provide us with strategic manufacturing capabilities and flexibility in the United States. We are now shipping IQ Microinverters from our U.S.-based contract manufacturing facilities in South Carolina and Texas, offering several new production lines across the two sites. Moving manufacturing to the United States allows us to take advantage of the benefits of the IRA as well as help us better serve our customers by cutting down delivery times and diversifying our supply chain. 
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we also began shipping residential and commercial microinverters, and batteries, with higher domestic content from our United States contract manufacturers, which are expected to help certain solar projects qualify for the Domestic Content Bonus Credit.
In the fourth quarter of 2024, we implemented a restructuring plan (the “2024 Restructuring Plan”) to better align our workforce and cost structure with our business needs, strategic priorities and ongoing commitment to profitable growth, while increasing operational efficiencies and reducing operating costs, which included the plan to cease operations at our contract manufacturing location in Mexico in the first half of 2025.
Customer Service
We continue to cultivate an organizational focus on customer satisfaction and are committed to providing a best-in-class customer experience. We maintain high levels of customer engagement through our customer support group, Enphase community, and the Enphase App. We continue to provide 24/7 support for installers and Enphase system owners globally across our phone, online chat and email communications channel. We continue to train our customer service agents with a goal of reducing average customer wait times to under two minutes, and we continue to expand our network of field service technicians in the United States, Europe and Australia to provide direct homeowner assistance. Our Net Promoter Score (commonly referred to as “NPS”) improved to 78% in 2024 from 76% in 2023 as a result of multiple customer service initiatives.
Research and Development
We plan to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development with the objective of developing new products and systems and increasing the value or reducing the cost of existing products and systems. Our research and development roadmap identifies new product features and defines improvement targets for existing products that enhance the benefit of our energy management solutions to our customers and support our growth plans. We measure the effectiveness of our research and development using metrics that include product cost, performance and reliability, homeowner and installer experience, as well as development cost and performance to schedule.
Intellectual Property
We operate in an industry in which innovation, investment in new ideas and protection of our intellectual property rights are critical for success. We protect our technology through a variety of means, including through patent, trademark, copyright and trade secrets laws in the United States and similar laws in other countries, confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements. As of December 31, 2024, we have approximately 406 global patents and 255 pending patent applications. Our patents are expiring on an ongoing basis between the present and approximately 2045, but there is not a material portion of our patent portfolio expiring in the near future.
Enphase Energy, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 12
Table

We have licensed certain technologies for application in hardware and software in our products. Such licenses are generally fully-paid, royalty-free licenses. Given the volume and pace of new patents worldwide, it may become necessary in the future to license intellectual property on terms that are yet unknown to us, and that may be less favorable than licenses in the past. In addition, we license open source software from various third parties for use in hardware and software. Such open source software is licensed under open source licenses, and we take efforts to maintain compliance with such licenses.
We continually assess the need for patent protection for those aspects of our technology that we believe provide significant competitive advantages. A majority of our patents relate to DC to AC power conversion, energy storage devices and related energy environments.
With respect to proprietary know-how that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests. We believe that many elements of our microinverter and storage manufacturing processes involve proprietary know-how, technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications, including technical processes, test equipment designs, algorithms and procedures.
We own or have rights to various trademarks and service marks in the United States and in other countries, including Enphase, the Enphase “e”, IQ, and many other marks. We rely on both registration of our marks as well as common law protection where available.
All of our research and development personnel have entered into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us. These agreements address intellectual property protection and require our employees to assign to us all of the inventions, designs and technologies they develop during the course of employment with us.
We also require our customers and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our technology or business plans.
As part of our overall strategy to protect our intellectual property, we may take legal actions to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property or from otherwise gaining access to our technology.
Government Regulations
Our business activities are subject to a changing patchwork of laws and regulations that prevail at the federal, state, regional and local levels as well as in foreign jurisdictions. For example, substantially all of our import operations are subject to complex trade and customs laws, regulations and tax requirements such as sanctions orders or tariffs set by governments through mutual agreements or unilateral actions. In addition, countries may from time to time adversely modify or impose additional duties, tariffs or other restrictions on the import or export of our fully manufactured products or the material components needed to make our products. Changes in tax policies or trade regulations, the disallowance of tax deductions on imported merchandise, or the imposition of new tariffs on imported products, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
We are also subject to other complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations related to anti-bribery and corruption, antitrust or competition, and data privacy and security, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation, among others. In addition, our business and operations are currently subject to environmental laws in various jurisdictions around the world, including the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment and Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment regulations adopted by the EU. We are also subject to disclosure and related requirements that apply to the presence of “conflict minerals” in our products or supply chain. We have policies and procedures in place to promote compliance with these laws and regulations. To date, our compliance actions and costs relating to these laws, rules and regulations have not resulted in a material cost or effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Government regulations are subject to change, and accordingly we are unable to assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements or whether our compliance with existing regulations will materially impact our business in the future.

Government Incentives
U.S. federal, state and local government bodies, as well as non-U.S. government bodies provide supportive policies and incentives to owners, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of solar energy and battery storage systems to promote the use of these resources in the form of rebates, tax credits, lower VAT rate and other financial incentives, such as system performance payments, payments for renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation and exclusion of solar energy systems from property tax assessments. The market for on‑grid rooftop solar applications, where solar power, possibly coupled with battery storage, is used to supplement a customer’s electricity purchased from the utility network or sold to a utility under tariff, often depends in large part on the availability and size of these government-issued subsidies and economic incentives, which help to catalyze customer acceptance of solar energy as an alternative to utility-provisioned power. The modifications to, or disallowance of, government subsidies or economic incentives could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Among other government-established incentives, net energy metering (“NEM”) and related policies have supported the growth of on-grid rooftop solar and storage products, and changes to such policies may significantly reduce demand for electricity from our solar and storage service offerings. NEM tariffs provide customers with compensation for exporting excess solar generation to the electrical grid.
In August 2022, the investment tax credit (“ITC”) was extended and a new advanced manufacturing production tax credit (“AMPTC”) was created, to incentivize clean energy component sourcing and production, including for the production of microinverters. This included a 10% ITC adder for solar system components that are manufactured with a minimum threshold of domestic content. The IRA provides an AMPTC of 11 cents per alternating current watt for microinverters, which has favorably impacted our results of operations in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. The AMPTC for microinverters decreases by 25% each year beginning in 2030 through the end of 2032. Under the IRA, the ITC was also extended until 2032 to allow a qualifying homeowner to deduct 30% of the cost of installing residential solar and battery systems from their U.S. federal income taxes, thereby returning a material portion of the system’s purchase price to homeowners. Under the terms of the IRA’s extension, the ITC for residential solar systems will remain at 30% through the end of 2032, reduce to 26% for 2033, reduce to 22% for 2034, and further reduce to 0% after the end of 2034, unless it is extended before that time. We believe the enactment of the IRA is favorable to our overall business.
In December 2022, the California Public Utilities Commission (“CPUC”) approved a NEM policy, called Net Energy Metering 3.0 (“NEM 3.0”), which went into effect starting April 15, 2023. The new policy substantially reduces the compensation that solar customers can earn by selling excess solar energy to the electric grid. The average hourly export rate in California under NEM 3.0 is approximately $0.05/kWh to $0.08/kWh compared to the prior average of $0.25/kWh to $0.35/kWh under Net Energy Metering 2.0 (“NEM 2.0”). In November 2023, the CPUC also adopted changes to its “Virtual NEM” and “NEM Aggregation” programs that prohibit multi-meter commercial or agricultural property owners from netting solar energy generated at or adjacent to those properties against import charges recorded on the meters at the property, except for residential account holders in a multi-family residential property. Both of these policy changes in California reduced demand for solar PV systems in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 and may continue to do so. However, the reduction in export compensation under NEM 3.0, coupled with rising utility rates, may encourage deployment of battery energy storage with solar PV systems and mitigate some of the demand reductions.
Seasonality
Historically, the majority of our revenue are from the North American and European regions which experience higher sales of our products in the second, third and fourth quarters and have been affected by seasonal customer demand trends, including weather patterns and construction cycles. The first quarter historically has had softer customer demand in our industry, due to these same factors. Although these seasonal factors are common in the solar sector, historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance. 
Environment and Climate Change
We have understood the climate change threat from the beginning and have been creating clean energy technologies needed to directly combat it, protect our environment and enable sustainable development. We recognize our ability to do so rests on our capacity to understand, anticipate and successfully navigate various types of climate risk. Our strategy is advancing solutions to meet any number of climate risk mitigation opportunities – solar energy equipment, battery storage, EV charging, smart load management and integration with grid modernization efforts.

We align our risk assessment and climate strategy with the recommendations of the Taskforce for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”), as all existing and emerging climate risk disclosure regulations are modeled on this framework. We issued our fourth TCFD aligned Environmental, Social and Governance Report in 2024 and plan to follow up with another aligned report in 2025.
We believe that sound corporate governance is critical to helping us achieve our goals, including with respect to designing products that address both energy generation and consumption. We continue to evolve a governance framework that exercises appropriate oversight of responsibilities at all levels throughout the company and manages its affairs consistent with high principles of business ethics and advancing a sustainable future for all. 
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2024, we had 2,781 full-time employees. Of the full-time employees, 1,171 were engaged in sales and marketing, 1,077 in research and development, 263 in general and administration, 159 in manufacturing and operations and 111 in solar system configuration design and permitting services.

Supporting our purpose of “Advancing a sustainable future for all,” all employees are expected to uphold the following core values that drive our culture:
•
Customer First
•
Integrity
•
Innovation
•
Teamwork
•
Quality
These core values are represented by how we work together, how we perform and how we all get rewarded. Values are reinforced in new hire training, culture workshops and everyday interactions. 
Talent
Our talent and culture are critical to our success. Our human capital management philosophy and objectives focus on creating a high-performance culture in which our employees deliver, succeed and lead. We achieve our objectives through various employee engagement and talent development efforts. Our employee engagement efforts include our quarterly all-employee town hall meetings, through which we aim to keep our employees well-informed and to increase transparency, and employee engagement events, through which we foster teamwork, networking, and enhance our workplace culture. We have established relationships with top universities worldwide, professional associations and industry groups to build a talent pipeline and established the Enphase Learning Academy to provide employees with regularly scheduled and on demand relevant technical and professional programs.
We are committed to promoting and cultivating an inclusive and diverse culture that welcomes and celebrates everyone without bias. In addition, we look to actively engage within our communities to foster and attain social equity. We became a corporate sponsor of the non-profit Women in Cleantech and Sustainability and our Chief Executive Officer signed the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion pledge. This shows our commitment to advancing diversity and inclusion in the workplace.

of Contents
Our compensation philosophy creates the framework for our rewards strategy. We have a pay-for-performance culture that ties compensation to the performance of the individual and our company. We provide competitive compensation programs that focus on the following five key elements:
•
Pay-for-performance: Reward and recognize leading contributors and high potential employees by paying market competitive total direct compensation, which includes base salary, quarterly bonus or commission, and stock-based compensation
•
External market-based research: Pay levels that are competitive with respect to the labor markets and industries in which we compete for talent
•
Internal equity: Maintaining internally consistent and non-discriminatory pay and pay practices
•
Fiscal responsibility: Providing programs in line with economic conditions and our company’s financial health
•
Legal compliance: Ensure the organization is legally compliant with employee compensation laws in all states and countries in which we operate
Health and Wellness
We invest in our employees through high-quality benefits and various health and wellness initiatives. Our benefits packages provide a balance of protection along with the flexibility to meet the individual needs of our employees. Our global flexible workplace policy introduced in response to COVID-19 pandemic allows employees in certain countries and locations to work in a remote or hybrid mode as business necessitates. Our focus remains on the safety of our employees and business partners, and we strive to protect the health and well-being of the communities in which we operate, in part, by providing technology to our employees, end-customers and business partners to help them do their best work while remote. We expect these business operating conditions will substantially remain in effect throughout 2025. We will continue to monitor the global workplace practices, and will make further changes to our business operations as may be permitted by federal, state, or local authorities and that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, end-customers, partners, suppliers and stockholders.
