Item 1.    Business
Executive Overview 
We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on delivering novel therapeutics for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (“MASH”), a serious liver disease with high unmet medical need that can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure and premature mortality. MASH was previously known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”). In 2023, global liver disease medical societies and patient groups came together to rename the disease, with the goal of establishing an affirmative, non-stigmatizing name and diagnosis. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) considers the term NASH interchangeable with MASH. MASH is expected to become the leading cause of liver transplantation in the United States and is already the leading cause of liver transplantation among women in the United States. Our medication, Rezdiffra (resmetirom), is a once-daily, oral, liver-directed thyroid hormone receptor (“THR-β”) agonist designed to target key underlying causes of MASH. In March 2024, Rezdiffra became the first and only therapy approved by the FDA for patients with MASH and was commercially available in the United States beginning in April 2024. Rezdiffra is indicated in conjunction with diet and exercise for the treatment of adults with noncirrhotic MASH with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis (consistent with stages F2 to F3 fibrosis).
The FDA's accelerated approval and Rezdiffra's approved prescribing information was supported by 52-week data from our Phase 3 MAESTRO-NASH trial in which both 100 mg and 80 mg doses of Rezdiffra demonstrated statistically significant improvement compared to placebo on (i) MASH resolution with no worsening of fibrosis and (ii) an improvement in fibrosis by at least one stage with no worsening of the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (“NAFLD”) activity score. As part of the post-marketing commitments agreed to with the FDA, MAESTRO-NASH remains ongoing as an outcomes trial where we are generating confirmatory outcomes data to 54-months that, if positive, is expected to verify a clinical benefit and support the full approval of Rezdiffra in noncirrhotic MASH. In addition, full approval in noncirrhotic MASH could also be based on results from our Phase 3 MAESTRO-NASH OUTCOMES trial. In this trial, we are assessing progression to liver decompensation events in patients with compensated MASH cirrhosis treated with Rezdiffra versus placebo. A positive outcome in this trial is also expected to support the full approval of Rezdiffra for noncirrhotic MASH, and expand the eligible patient population for Rezdiffra with an additional indication in patients with compensated MASH cirrhosis.
2024 Highlights
We experienced a transformational year in 2024, highlighted by the following key events:
•
In March 2024, we announced that the FDA granted accelerated approval of Rezdiffra in conjunction with diet and exercise for the treatment of adults with noncirrhotic MASH with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis (consistent with stages F2 to F3 fibrosis). The FDA approved 60 mg, 80 mg and 100 mg doses. Rezdiffra became commercially available in April 2024 as the first and only approved therapy for MASH.
•
In March 2024, we announced that our marketing authorization application (“MA”) for resmetirom for the treatment of MASH with liver fibrosis was validated and is under evaluation with the European Medicines Agency’s (“EMA”) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”). The CHMP opinion and subsequent decision regarding the Conditional Marketing Authorization by the European Commission (“EC”) in the European Union (“EU”) is expected in mid-2025. Pending regulatory approval, we expect to launch Rezdiffra in Europe on a country-by-country basis commencing with Germany in the second half of 2025.
•
Following FDA approval, we raised $659.9 million in net proceeds from an underwritten public offering. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for our commercial activities in connection with the launch of Rezdiffra in the United States and general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, research and development expenditures, ongoing clinical trial expenditures, manufacture and supply of drug substance and drug products, ex-U.S. commercialization or potential partnering opportunities, potential acquisitions or licensing of new technologies, capital expenditures and working capital.
•
In June 2024, we announced new data from the Phase 3 MAESTRO-NASH trial of Rezdiffra presented at the European Association for the Study of the Liver (the “EASL”) Congress. During the congress, 
5

Contents
the EASL updated their practice guidelines to recommend Rezdiffra as a first-line therapy for MASH, subject to regulatory approval in Europe.
•
In September 2024, we announced the publication of health-related quality of life results from the Phase 3 MAESTRO-NASH trial of Rezdiffra. Patients treated with Rezdiffra experienced clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in emotional well-being and health distress. The results were published in the journal 
Hepatology
.
•
In October 2024, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (“AASLD”), a leading organization of scientists and health care professionals committed to preventing and curing liver disease, updated their practice guidance to recommend Rezdiffra as a first-line therapy for MASH and implement recommendations regarding its use for practicing clinicians. 
•
In October 2024, we announced that we completed enrollment in the MAESTRO-NASH OUTCOMES trial evaluating Rezdiffra for the treatment of 845 patients with compensated MASH cirrhosis. This event-driven trial is expected to deliver results in 2027. Positive results from this trial could position Rezdiffra as the only treatment for F2 to F4 MASH and the only therapy with outcomes data this decade.
•
In November 2024, we presented 11 Rezdiffra and health economics research abstracts at the AASLD Liver Meeting. 
Our Strategy 
The critical components of our business strategy include the following:
Successfully execute on a first-in-disease launch
.

Rezdiffra became the first FDA-approved therapy for the treatment of MASH in March 2024 and was commercially available beginning in April 2024. We have established a full capability commercial organization, including marketing, sales and market access expertise, to support the launch of Rezdiffra in the United States. We continue to execute our launch strategy by educating healthcare providers and patients on the risks of MASH and the potential clinical benefits and appropriate use of Rezdiffra. We are also supporting the creation of care pathways for patients at physician offices, driving breadth and depth of Rezdiffra prescribers, engaging with payers to increase Rezdiffra coverage and supporting patient access to therapy. We believe Rezdiffra’s product profile as a liver-directed, once-daily, generally well-tolerated oral therapy, as well as its first-to-market position, provide meaningful points of differentiation in the MASH competitive landscape.
Deepen our commitment to MASH
.

We intend to maximize the value of Rezdiffra by broadening its indication. We have fully enrolled our Phase 3 MAESTRO-NASH OUTCOMES trial evaluating Rezdiffra in patients with compensated MASH cirrhosis. A positive outcome from this trial is expected to support the full approval of Rezdiffra for noncirrhotic MASH and an additional indication for Rezdiffra in patients with compensated MASH cirrhosis. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to expand Rezdiffra's label and generate new data to maintain its leadership position in the MASH treatment landscape.
Drive future growth through geographic expansion
. Rezdiffra is currently under evaluation with the CHMP and has the potential to become the first therapy for patients with MASH with liver fibrosis to receive approval in Europe. The CHMP opinion and the subsequent decision regarding the Conditional Marketing Authorization by the EC in the EU are expected in mid-2025. Pending regulatory approval, we expect to directly launch Rezdiffra in Europe on a country-by-country basis, expected to commence with Germany in the second half of 2025. In anticipation of a favorable regulatory decision, we have begun establishing commercial capabilities in Europe. In addition, we may evaluate potential partnership or out-license opportunities to develop and commercialize Rezdiffra in markets outside of the United States and Europe. 
Acquire rights to drug development candidates, commercial products and technologies
. We plan to selectively in-license or acquire rights to programs at all stages of development and commercial products to take advantage of our drug development and commercial capabilities. With a goal of building a well‑balanced and diversified portfolio, we assess a variety of factors for potential product candidates and technologies. Our criteria for possible acquisition or in-licensing opportunities include the rationale for addressing the targeted disease, likelihood of regulatory approval, commercial viability, intellectual property protection, prospects for favorable pricing and reimbursement and competition. We intend to be opportunistic in our business development activities to achieve our long-term strategic goals.
Rezdiffra for Patients with MASH
Rezdiffra is our first and only approved product. Rezdiffra received accelerated approval on March 14, 2024 in conjunction with diet and exercise for the treatment of adults with noncirrhotic MASH with moderate to advanced liver

fibrosis (consistent with stages F2 to F3 fibrosis). Rezdiffra is a once-daily, oral, liver-directed THR-β agonist designed to target key underlying causes of MASH.
U.S. Marketing Approval of Rezdiffra
Rezdiffra was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation in April 2023, and we completed the submission of our New Drug Application (“NDA”) to the FDA in July 2023 pursuant to Section 506(c) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and 21 C.F.R. Part 314 Subpart H (Accelerated Approval of New Drugs for Serious or Life-Threatening Illnesses) (Subpart H). Accelerated approval allows drugs that (i) are being developed to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and (ii) provide a meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments to be approved substantially based on an intermediate endpoint or a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, rather than a clinical endpoint such as survival or irreversible morbidity. The FDA granted our request for priority review of our NDA and assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) date of March 14, 2024. On the PDUFA date, the FDA granted accelerated approval for Rezdiffra. The FDA's accelerated approval and Rezdiffra's approved prescribing information were supported by results from our Phase 3 MAESTRO-NASH trial and additional safety data from the Phase 3 MAESTRO-NAFLD-1 and MAESTRO-NAFLD-OLE extensions trials, each of which was 52-weeks in duration. Following 52 weeks of treatment in the MAESTRO-NASH trial, both 100 mg and 80 mg doses of Rezdiffra demonstrated statistically significant improvement compared to placebo on two primary endpoints: MASH resolution (including a reduction in the NAFLD activity score by ≥ 2 points) with no worsening of fibrosis, and an improvement in fibrosis by at least one stage with no worsening of the NAFLD activity score. See the section titled “—Clinical Trial Overview” in this Annual Report for additional information on our clinical trials for Rezdiffra.
In connection with the FDA's accelerated approval, we have agreed to certain post-marketing commitments, including completing our MAESTRO-NASH trial to demonstrate a clinical benefit of Rezdiffra on composite endpoints. Patients enrolled in the MAESTRO-NASH trial have continued on therapy after the initial 52-week treatment period for up to 54 months to accrue and measure hepatic clinical outcome events, including progression to cirrhosis on biopsy and hepatic decompensation events, as well as all-cause mortality. Positive confirmatory outcomes data from this trial is expected to verify a clinical benefit and support the full approval of Rezdiffra in noncirrhotic MASH. Separate from our commitment to complete the MAESTRO-NASH trial, we have fully enrolled our Phase 3 MAESTRO-NASH OUTCOMES trial, which is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial that noninvasively measures progression to liver decompensation events in patients with compensated MASH cirrhosis. The primary endpoint of MAESTRO-NASH OUTCOMES is the incidence of composite liver-related outcome events. Key inclusion criteria are well-compensated MASH cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A) and presence of three metabolic risk factors (metabolic syndrome). Patients are randomized 3:1 in a blinded manner to receive 80 mg resmetirom or matching placebo, given orally once daily. We expect results from the OUTCOMES trial in 2027. Positive data from our MAESTRO-NASH OUTCOMES trial may also support the full approval of Rezdiffra in noncirrhotic MASH and support approval for patients with compensated cirrhosis, expanding the eligible patient population. 
Market Opportunity for Rezdiffra in MASH
Disease Overview
MASH is a more advanced form of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (“MASLD”). MASLD has become the most common liver disease in the United States and other developed countries and is characterized by an accumulation of fat in the liver with no other apparent causes. MASH can progress to cirrhosis or liver failure, can require liver transplantation and can also result in liver cancer. Patients with MASH, especially those with more advanced metabolic risk factors (hypertension, concomitant type 2 diabetes), are at increased risk for adverse cardiovascular events and increased morbidity and mortality. In addition, MASH patients with moderate to advanced fibrosis (consistent with fibrosis stages F2 and F3) have a 10- to 17-times higher risk of liver-related mortality.
In addition to the accumulation of fat in the liver, MASH is characterized by inflammation and cellular damage with or without fibrosis, which may ultimately progress to cirrhosis. Within MASH cirrhosis, patients can be categorized as being compensated or decompensated. MASH with compensated cirrhosis is characterized by liver scarring or damage that reduces the ability to process blood supplied to the liver, though patients generally remain asymptomatic with normal liver function. MASH patients with compensated cirrhosis are on the cusp of negative consequences associated with end-stage liver disease including decompensation, esophageal varices, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, liver cancer and liver failure.
Progression to cirrhosis and other late-stage complications can occur within five to ten years after an initial MASH diagnosis. MASH patients with type-2 diabetes have a heightened risk of MASH disease progression. Once the disease advances beyond MASH to such life-threatening conditions as liver cancer or liver failure, liver transplantation is the only treatment alternative. MASH is the leading cause of liver transplants for women in the United States and is expected to become the leading cause of liver transplants overall. With more advanced liver disease as a result of unaddressed MASH with fibrosis, the burden to the healthcare system in terms of healthcare resource utilization and cost increases, driven by hospitalization due to decompensated disease, treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma and liver transplants. Importantly, due to the limited availability of donor organs and the comorbidities associated with MASH,

patients with MASH who are put on the transplant list are at much lower odds of actually getting transplanted relative to those with liver disease driven by other causes. As such, Rezdiffra addresses a significant unmet medical need for patients with MASH.
Commercial Strategy
We launched Rezdiffra in the United States in April 2024. Prior to receiving FDA approval, we conducted quantitative and qualitative market research studies and secondary data analytics to inform the commercial strategy for Rezdiffra. These studies and analytics evaluated the size of the market opportunity for Rezdiffra as well as physician, patient and payer perspectives on unmet needs in MASH patient care and the Rezdiffra product profile. 
Based on published epidemiology data and an analysis of medical claims using ICD-10 disease diagnosis codes, we estimate that approximately 1.5 million patients have been diagnosed with MASH in the United States, of which approximately 525,000 have MASH with moderate to advanced fibrosis. We estimate that approximately 315,000 diagnosed patients with MASH with moderate to advanced fibrosis are under the care of approximately 14,000 specialist prescribers which we are targeting during the commercial launch of Rezdiffra. Over time, as disease awareness improves and disease prevalence increases, we expect the number of identified MASH patients with moderate to advanced fibrosis eligible for treatment to grow.
Given that Rezdiffra is a first-in-disease launch, we continue to focus our efforts on educating healthcare providers and patients on the risks of MASH and the potential clinical benefits and appropriate use of Rezdiffra. We are also supporting the creation of care pathways for patients at physician offices, driving breadth and depth of Rezdiffra prescribers, engaging with payers to increase Rezdiffra coverage and supporting patient access to therapy.
We also expect to directly commercialize resmetirom in Europe if we receive a positive CHMP opinion and the subsequent grant of Conditional Marketing Authorization by the EC in the EU. A regulatory decision in the EU is expected in mid-year 2025. The prevalence rate of MASH in Europe is similar to that of the United States. In the event of a positive decision, we expect to launch Rezdiffra in Europe on a country-by-country basis, commencing with Germany in the second half of 2025. To support our planned launch in Europe, we have hired a Head of International and other individuals to serve in a number of other key leadership positions, established our European headquarters in Switzerland and engaged a manufacturer for the primary supply of our commercial product in Europe. We also intend to employ European sales and marketing personnel on a country-by-country basis.
Clinical Trial Overview
Set forth below is a summary of our clinical trial programs for Rezdiffra:
•
The pivotal MAESTRO-NASH (moderate to advanced fibrosis) trial evaluated daily oral doses of resmetirom at 80 mg and 100 mg doses. The primary 52-week results of the MAESTRO-NASH trial supported the grant of accelerated approval by the FDA and were published in the 
New England Journal of Medicine
 in February 2024. This trial remains ongoing as part of our post-marketing commitments to the FDA. The 54-month outcomes portion of the trial is designed to generate confirmatory data that, if positive, is expected to verify a clinical benefit and support the full approval of Rezdiffra in noncirrhotic MASH. 
•
The MAESTRO-NAFLD-1 (Safety) trial was a 52-week trial that noninvasively evaluated the safety and tolerability of resmetirom and provided a larger safety database to support regulatory benefit-risk assessment. The primary results from the MAESTRO-NAFLD-1 trial were published in 
Nature Medicine
 in October 2023. MAESTRO-NAFLD-OLE, an open-label active treatment extension of MAESTRO-NAFLD-1, is ongoing to collect additional data in patients with noncirrhotic MASH and patients with compensated MASH cirrhosis.
•
MAESTRO-NASH OUTCOMES (Compensated Cirrhosis) is ongoing to evaluate progression to liver decompensation events in patients with compensated MASH cirrhosis treated with resmetirom versus placebo. A positive outcome is expected to support the full approval of Rezdiffra for noncirrhotic MASH and expand the eligible patient population for Rezdiffra with an additional indication in patients with compensated MASH cirrhosis. This event-driven trial is expected to deliver results in 2027.

MAESTRO-NASH Trial
In December 2022, we announced topline results from the pivotal Phase 3 MAESTRO-NASH biopsy trial of resmetirom and the primary results were published in the 
New England Journal of Medicine
 in February 2024. Resmetirom achieved both primary endpoints with both daily oral doses, 80 mg and 100 mg, relative to placebo.
Patients meeting eligibility requirements for MAESTRO-NASH were randomized 1:1:1 to receive resmetirom 80 mg, resmetirom 100 mg or placebo taken orally once daily. Baseline liver biopsy fibrosis scores included F3 (~60%), F2 (~35%), F1B (~5%) (primary analysis population) with 84% with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (“NAS”) of ≥5. 
A second biopsy was conducted after 52 weeks of treatment for assessment of the dual primary endpoints. The primary efficacy analysis assessed histological response at 52 weeks in 955 patients with biopsy-confirmed MASH with significant fibrosis (modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population) that excluded 11 intent-to-treat patients who had their Week 52 biopsy after Week 60 due to COVID-related reasons per regulatory guidelines. Patients without a second biopsy due to early trial discontinuation or missing liver biopsy (approximately 17% across treatment arms) were included and considered as non-responders in the primary efficacy analyses (mITT). The compliance to treatment was high and minimally impacted by COVID-19 pandemic restrictions.

All biopsies were read independently by two central pathologists. Each pathologist’s scores showed a similar statistically significant magnitude of response at both doses for both liver biopsy endpoints. Biopsy endpoints were achieved independent of baseline fibrosis stage or diabetes status, including similar statistical significance and magnitude of effect at both doses in subgroups of F2, F3 and F2/F3 patients. Other secondary liver biopsy endpoints that were achieved at both doses include ≥2 point reduction in NAS with no worsening of fibrosis, ≥2 point reduction in NAS with ≥1-stage improvement in fibrosis, MASH resolution (with ≥2 point reduction in NAS) with ≥1-stage improvement in fibrosis and a 2-stage reduction in fibrosis without worsening of NAS. 
Multiple secondary endpoints were achieved, including statistically significant reduction from baseline in liver enzymes (Alanine aminotransferase (“ALT”), aspartate aminotransferase (“AST”) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (“GGT”)). Reductions in atherogenic lipids and lipoproteins, fibrosis biomarkers and imaging tests (magnetic resonance imaging proton density fat-fraction (“MRI-PDFF”), controlled attenuation parameter (“CAP”) and liver stiffness measures) were observed in resmetirom treatment arms as compared with placebo. MAESTRO-NASH included many biomarker and imaging assessments that may be used in real world clinical practice to identify appropriate patients for treatment and monitor response to resmetirom. 
Safety
The frequency of serious adverse events (SAEs) was similar across treatment arms in the MAESTRO-NASH trial: 11%, 13% and 12% for the 80 mg, 100 mg and placebo groups, respectively. The rate of trial discontinuation for adverse events over the entire treatment period was low: 2.8%, 7.7% and 3.4 % for the 80 mg, 100 mg and placebo groups, respectively. SAEs occurred at expected rates based on the patient population.
Consistent with previous Phase 2 and Phase 3 data, the most common adverse events (“AEs”) reported with greater frequency in the resmetirom groups versus placebo were an excess of generally mild and transient diarrhea at the beginning of therapy, in 27%, 33% and 16% of subjects in the 80 mg, 100 mg and placebo groups, respectively, and generally mild nausea that occurred at rates of 22%, 19% and 13% of subjects in the 80 mg, 100 mg and placebo groups, respectively. Approximately 50% of the diarrhea AEs were described as “worsening of preexisting diarrhea” or “intermittent/loose stool(s)”; no episodes of severe diarrhea were reported. The median duration of diarrhea was approximately 15to 20 days, independent of resmetirom dose.

Trial data indicated resmetirom treatment had no effect on heart rate or body weight and was not associated with arrhythmias. Blood pressure appeared slightly reduced among resmetirom-treated patients. Sex hormones were unchanged from baseline. Independent of thyroxine replacement status, resmetirom treatment reduced prohormone T4, as reflected by free thyroxine (FT4), by approximately 16% to 19% with no effect on thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) or the active thyroid hormone, free triiodothyronine (FT3). Relative to placebo, resmetirom treated patients did not show increases in fractures or fracture risk scores.
MAESTRO-NASH is an ongoing blinded Phase 3 clinical trial, and enrolled patients continue on therapy after the Week 52 liver biopsy for up to a total of 54 months to accrue and measure hepatic clinical outcome events, including progression to cirrhosis on biopsy and hepatic decompensation events, as well as all-cause mortality. The outcomes portion of the MAESTRO-NASH trial is designed to generate confirmatory data that, if positive, is expected to verify a clinical benefit and support the full approval of Rezdiffra in noncirrhotic MASH.
MAESTRO-NAFLD-1 Trial
In January 2022, we announced topline results from the Phase 3 MAESTRO-NAFLD-1 safety trial of resmetirom. The MAESTRO-NAFLD-1 trial was published in 
Nature Medicine
 in November 2023. We reported that resmetirom demonstrated statistical significance for primary and key secondary endpoints summarized below from the double-blind placebo-controlled 969-patient portion of the trial. These endpoints indicated that resmetirom (1) was well-tolerated at 80 and 100 mg in patients treated for 52 weeks, (2) provided significant and clinically relevant reductions in liver fat as measured by MRI-PDFF and (3) significantly reduced atherogenic lipids, including low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (“LDLc”), apolipoprotein B and triglycerides. 
A total of 972 patients were randomized in the double-blind arms of the MAESTRO-NAFLD-1 trial: 969 patients were included in the safety population and 943 patients were included in a modified ITT population for evaluation of key secondary and other endpoints. Important inclusion criteria included the presence of three risk factors of metabolic syndrome, a level of liver fibrosis (measured by FibroScan) consistent with a range of stages of liver fibrosis and >=8% liver fat (measured by MRI-PDFF).
AEs observed in the MAESTRO-NAFLD-1 trial were generally mild to moderate in severity. The frequency of SAEs was similar across treatment arms and discontinuation for AEs was low. 
Consistent with published data, the most common AE reported with greater frequency in the resmetirom groups as compared to the placebo was generally mild diarrhea or increased stool frequency at the beginning of therapy, which occurred in 9% and approximately 17% over the placebo rate in the 80 mg and 100 mg dose groups, respectively. 
The following hierarchically-controlled key secondary endpoints were reported for both the 80 mg and 100 mg resmetirom dose groups. Resmetirom provided significant reductions in liver fat as measured by MRI-PDFF and reduced atherogenic lipids, including LDLc, apolipoprotein B and triglycerides. Open-label arm data is reported in the far-left column below and double-blind arm data are reported in the remaining columns below. Although both arms were randomized in MAESTRO-NAFLD-1, lipid reductions were numerically greater in the 100 mg open label treatment arm compared to the 100 mg double-blind arm, and we believe this is due to greater visit and dose interruptions experienced by open-label arm patients during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, as patients in the open-label active 100 mg treatment arm were less impacted by COVID-related dose interruptions than double-blind patients.

The MAESTRO-NAFLD-1 trial also included an open label active treatment arm with 180 patients with compensated MASH cirrhosis. Data following 52 weeks of treatment with 80 or 100 mg of resmetirom daily showed improved liver chemistry tests, a reduction in vibration-controlled transient elastography ("VCTE") in a responder analysis and a statistically significant reduction in liver volume by an average of approximately 20%. In addition, following two years of treatment with Rezdiffra, 101 patients from this cohort achieved a mean 6.7 kPa (kilopascals) reduction in liver stiffness, and 51% of patients achieved a ≥25% reduction in liver stiffness, each as measured by VCTE. These data from this open label active treatment arm continue to support the rationale for our MAESTRO-NASH OUTCOMES trial evaluating Rezdiffra in patients with compensated MASH cirrhosis.
MAESTRO-NASH OUTCOMES Trial
In October 2024, we announced that we completed enrollment of MAESTRO-NASH OUTCOMES, a Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial that will noninvasively measure progression to liver decompensation events in 845 patients with compensated MASH cirrhosis, exceeding our initial enrollment target. 
The primary endpoint of MAESTRO-NASH OUTCOMES is the incidence of composite liver-related outcome events, including all-cause mortality, liver transplant, hepatic decompensation (ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, gastroesophageal variceal hemorrhage) and confirmed increase of Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score from <12 to ≥15 due to progression of MASH cirrhosis. Key inclusion criteria are well-compensated MASH cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A) and presence of three metabolic risk factors (metabolic syndrome). Patients will be randomized 3:1 in a blinded manner to receive 80 mg resmetirom or matching placebo, given orally once daily. We expect results from this event-driven trial in 2027.
A positive outcome is expected to support the full approval of Rezdiffra for noncirrhotic MASH, potentially accelerating the timeline to full approval. In addition, this trial has the potential to support approval of an additional indication for Rezdiffra in patients with compensated MASH cirrhosis.
Collaborations
VIA Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“VIA”) entered into a research, development and commercialization agreement (the “Roche Agreement”) with Hoffmann-La Roche (“Roche”), on December 18, 2008. We subsequently assumed all of VIA’s rights in, to and under, and all of VIA’s obligations under, the Roche Agreement pursuant to an asset purchase agreement, dated September 14, 2011. Pursuant to the terms of the Roche Agreement, we, as successor-in-interest to VIA, assumed control of all development and commercialization of resmetirom and hold exclusive worldwide rights for all potential indications. Under the Roche Agreement, Roche exclusively licensed certain patent rights and know-how relating to resmetirom in exchange for consideration consisting of an upfront payment, milestone payments and single-digit royalty payments based on net sales of Rezdiffra and any derivative products of resmetirom, subject to certain reductions. In 2011, we commenced Phase 1 clinical trials and subsequently paid Roche a related milestone payment. In October 2016, we commenced a Phase 2 clinical trial in MASH and subsequently paid Roche a related milestone payment. In 2019, we commenced a Phase 3 clinical trial in MASH and subsequently paid Roche a $2.0 million related milestone payment. In March 2024, we received FDA approval of Rezdiffra and subsequently paid Roche a $5.0 million related milestone payment. The remaining milestone payment obligation under the Roche Agreement is $3.0 million and is tied to regulatory approval in a major market country in Europe for resmetirom or any derivative product. 
Pursuant to the Roche Agreement, we must use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct clinical and commercial development programs for products containing resmetirom. If we determine not to pursue the development or commercialization of resmetirom in certain jurisdictions, Roche may terminate the license for such territories. The Roche Agreement will expire, unless earlier terminated pursuant to other provisions of the Roche Agreement, on the last to occur of (i) the expiration of the last valid claim of a licensed patent covering the manufacture, use or sale of products containing resmetirom or (ii) ten years after the first sale of a product containing resmetirom. 
Competition 
The development and commercialization of new drugs in MASH is highly competitive. We will face competition with respect to all product candidates we have developed or may develop or commercialize in the future from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies worldwide. The key factors affecting the success of an approved product will generally be such product's efficacy, safety profile, drug interactions, method of administration, pricing, reimbursement and level of promotional activity relative to those of competing drugs.
Our potential competitors include companies with substantially greater financial, technical and personnel resources than us. In addition, our competitors may have significantly greater research, development, manufacturing and commercial infrastructures. Our ability to compete successfully will depend largely on our ability to leverage our collective experience in drug development and commercialization to:

•
develop medicines that are differentiated from other products in the market;
•
obtain patent or proprietary protection for our products and technologies; 
•
obtain required regulatory approvals; 
•
commercialize our drugs, if approved; and 
•
attract and retain high-quality research, development and commercial personnel. 
While Rezdiffra is currently the only FDA-approved drug for the treatment of MASH, there are more than 150 drugs in development for MASH by companies ranging in size from small biotech companies to large pharma organizations. Investigational candidates include, among others, thyroid hormone receptor beta agonists, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists (PPAR) glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists, dual GLP-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) agonists, fatty acid synthase (FASN) inhibitors, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21) stimulators, farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonists, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) inhibitors and dual GLP-1/glucagon receptor agonists. Companies conducting Phase 3 trials include Novo Nordisk A/S, Inventiva S.A., Akero Therapeutics, Inc., 89bio Inc. and Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH. Novo Nordisk plans to submit approval filings for their GLP-1 agonist for the treatment of MASH in the United States and Europe in the first half of 2025. In addition, there are 60 investigational therapies being evaluated in Phase 2 clinical trials in MASH. 
We believe that Rezdiffra’s product profile and first-to-market advantage provide meaningful points of differentiation in the MASH competitive landscape. In addition, we believe positive results from the Phase 3 MAESTRO-NASH OUTCOMES trial could position Rezdiffra as the first medication to receive approval in both MASH with moderate to advanced fibrosis (consistent with stages F2 to F3 fibrosis) and MASH with compensated cirrhosis (consistent with stage F4c fibrosis). See the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Commercialization and Continued Approval of Rezdiffra—We operate in a highly competitive and changing environment, and if we are unable to adapt to our environment, we may be unable to compete successfully.” in this Annual Report for additional discussion of the competitive risks we face.
Research and Development
Since our inception, we have focused significant resources on our research and development activities. Costs incurred in performing research and development activities include internal costs (including cash compensation and stock-based compensation); costs for clinical trial consultants, contract research organizations, clinical sites and 
other external services; clinical 
drug manufacturing and supply costs; milestone payments under licensing agreements; other costs of conducting trials including the costs of materials and supplies; the costs associated with seeking regulatory approval and other costs associated with our preclinical and clinical programs. Please refer to Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” of this Annual Report for a discussion of our research and development expenses incurred during the last three fiscal years. 
Manufacturing, Supply and Distribution 
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third-party contract manufacturers (“CMOs”) for all required starting materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients (“API”) and finished product for the manufacture of any product candidates that we may develop for larger-scale preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial quantities of Rezdiffra and any future drug candidates that may be approved. 
In December 2024, we entered into a Resmetirom Commercial Supply Agreement (the “Evonik Supply Agreement”) with Evonik Corporation (“Evonik”). Pursuant to the Evonik Supply Agreement, Evonik has agreed to manufacture and supply resmetirom, the API in Rezdiffra, in commercial quantities. We have agreed to provide Evonik with a forecast of our purchases on a rolling basis. Under the Evonik Agreement, our purchase price for supply of resmetirom is based on the volume of material subject to a purchase order. The initial term of the Evonik Agreement will expire on December 31, 2029 and will be automatically renewed for successive two year periods, unless terminated in accordance with the terms of the Evonik Agreement. In addition, in August 2023, we entered into a Commercial Supply Agreement (the “UPM Supply Agreement”) with UPM Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“UPM”) for the primary commercial supply of Rezdiffra tablets in the United States. Pursuant to the UPM Supply Agreement, we must purchase a specified percentage of our annual requirements for Rezdiffra from UPM at volume-driven prices. The initial term of the UPM Agreement will expire in April 2032 and will be automatically renewed for two year periods unless terminated in accordance with the terms of the UPM Agreement. We have also entered into a supply agreement with a German-based manufacturer for the primary commercial supply of Rezdiffra tablets in Europe, pending EC approval, and to serve as a secondary commercial supplier 
12

for the U.S. market. All of our CMO partners have extensive technical expertise, GMP experience and experience manufacturing our specific technology. We believe our supply arrangements are satisfactory for our current operations.
Rezdiffra is distributed in the United States through a network of specialty pharmacy providers that deliver Rezdiffra to patients. We may expand our distribution network in the future.
Intellectual Property 
We will be able to protect our technology and products from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent we are covered by valid and enforceable patents or such knowledge is effectively maintained as trade secrets. Patents and other proprietary rights are thus an essential element of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position.
Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our current product and future product candidates, technology and know-how, our ability to freely operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and our ability to establish proprietary rights and prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing United States and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, and maintaining the confidentiality of inventions and improvements that are material to the development of our business.
As of December 31, 2024, we own or co-own eight United States issued patents and 103 foreign issued patents, 16 United States pending patent applications and 98 foreign pending patent applications and one international patent application filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty. Each of these patents and patent applications is directed to resmetirom, including composition-of-matter, certain polymorph forms, methods of making resmetirom, the use of resmetirom in the treatment of key disease indications or other THR-β analogs and uses thereof. Our current patent portfolio covers the United States and certain other jurisdictions worldwide. The international patent application can be used as the basis for multiple additional patent applications worldwide. In addition, pursuant to the Roche Agreement, Roche granted us an exclusive license to certain United States and foreign patents and patent applications owned by Roche and Roche know-how relating to resmetirom. The Roche Agreement imposes various diligence, milestone payment, royalty payment, insurance, indemnification, and other obligations on us.
Issued patents directed to resmetirom have statutory expiration dates between 2026 and 2038, excluding any patent term extensions or equivalents thereof that might be available following the grant of marketing authorizations. We have pending patent applications directed to resmetirom that, if issued, would be expected to expire in the United States and in countries outside of the United States in 2044, excluding any patent term adjustment that might be available following the grant of the patent. We have a pending patent application for other THR-β analogs that, if issued, would be expected to expire in the United States and in countries outside of the United States in 2043, excluding any patent term adjustment that might be available following the grant of such patent.
Our trademarks are protected under the common law or by registration in the United States and other countries. We seek to protect our proprietary processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our personnel, including consultants and commercial partners. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information.
See the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Intellectual Property” in this Annual Report for a discussion of the risks associated with our intellectual property. 
Government Regulation
Government Regulation and Product Approval 
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, monitoring and reporting, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of drug products such as those we are developing. A new drug must be approved by the FDA through the new drug application (“NDA”) process before it may be legally marketed in the United States and must be approved by foreign regulatory authorities via various analogous procedures before it can be marketed in the applicable country. The animal and 
13
Table of 
Contents
other non-clinical data and the results of human clinical trials performed under an Investigational New Drug application (“IND”) and under similar foreign applications will become part of the NDA. 
United States Drug Development Process 
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state and local statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other things, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters and other types of enforcement-related letters, requesting product recalls, product seizures, changes to the conditions surrounding marketing approval such as labeling changes or changes to a Risk Evaluation and Mitigations Strategies (“REMS”) program, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal investigations and penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
•
completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies, some in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practices (“GLP”), the Animal Welfare Act administered and enforced by the United States Department of Agriculture and other applicable regulations; 
•
submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
•
approval by an institutional review board (“IRB”) before each clinical trial may be initiated at each clinical site; 
•
performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials under protocols submitted to the FDA and reviewed and approved by each IRB, conducted in accordance with federal regulations and according to Good Clinical Practices (“GCP”) to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use; 
•
preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA (and the FDA’s acceptance for filing of the NDA); 
•
completion of registration batches and validation of the manufacturing process to show ability to consistently produce quality batches of product; 
•
satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable; 
•
satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
•
satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data;
•
payment of user fees and procurement of FDA approval of the NDA;
•
FDA review and approval of the NDA; and
•
compliance with any post-approval requirements, including, as applicable, REMS and post-approval trials required by the FDA.
Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies, to assess the initial safety and quality profile of the product. Animal studies must be performed in compliance with federal regulations and requirements, including, as applicable, GLP and the Animal Welfare Act. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. The sponsor will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be 
14
Table of 
Contents
used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, if the trial lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If during this 30-day period the FDA does not raise any concerns or issues that must be addressed prior to the commencement of clinical trials or does not impose a clinical hold, the IND becomes effective 30 days following the FDA’s receipt of the IND and the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance, or other reasons. 
All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP. They must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually. In addition, timely safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions, any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol, or animal test results that suggest a significant risk to human subjects. An IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve each protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution and must also approve the consent form that must be provided to each trial subject or his or her legal representative, monitor the trial until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations. Foreign trials conducted under an IND must meet the same requirements that apply to trials being conducted in the United States. Data from a foreign trial not conducted under an IND may be submitted in support of an NDA if the trial was conducted in accordance with GCP and the FDA is able to validate the data. 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases: 
•
Phase 1: 
The product candidate is initially introduced into humans. Phase 1 clinical trials are typically conducted in healthy human subjects, but in some situations are conducted in patients with the target disease or condition. Phase 1 clinical trials are generally designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion of the product candidate in humans, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness. 
•
Phase 2: 
This phase involves trials in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 
•
Phase 3: 
This phase involves trials undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These trials are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide, if appropriate, an adequate basis for product approval and product labeling. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the product candidate, although a single Phase 3 clinical trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in certain instances. 
The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. In some cases, clinical trials are also monitored by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor. These groups are often referred to as data monitoring committees. This group typically provides recommendations to the trial sponsor for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points. These decisions are based on the data monitoring committee’s independent review of data from the ongoing trial. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. Further, success in either preclinical studies or early-stage clinical trials does not assure success in later-stage clinical trials. In general, sponsors of most interventional clinical trials that are not Phase 1, are required to submit certain clinical trial information for inclusion in the public clinical trial registry and results data bank maintained by the National Institutes of Health, which are publicly available at http://clinicaltrials.gov. Sponsors are generally also obligated to disclose the results of these clinical trials after completion. Competitors and others may use this publicly-available information to gain knowledge regarding the design and progress of our development programs.
During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the end of Phase 2 meeting to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial that they believe will support approval of the new drug. 
15
Table of 
Contents
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing and assuring the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
United States Review and Approval Processes
The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling, and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for a specific indication. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of user fees under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, as amended (“PDUFA”) ; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. The sponsor under an approved NDA is also subject to annual program user fees. Program fees are assessed for each approved prescription drug product identified in an approved application, with up to five program fees per application. These fees are typically modified annually. The FDA conducts a preliminary review of a submitted NDA within 60 days from receipt to ensure that the application is sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts the application for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA’s PDUFA performance goals generally provide for action on an NDA within 10 months of the 60-day filing date. That deadline can be extended under certain circumstances, including by the FDA’s requests for additional information. The targeted action date can also be shortened to within 6 months of the 60-day filing date for products that are granted priority review designation because they are intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. In addition, the FDA often will conduct a bioresearch monitoring inspection of the clinical trial sites involved in conducting pivotal trials to ensure data integrity and compliance with applicable GCP requirements. The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. The approval process is lengthy and often difficult, and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data and information. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. 
At the end of the review period, the FDA may issue an approval letter following satisfactory completion of all aspects of the review process, or the FDA may issue a complete response letter (“CRL”), which generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require additional clinical or other data or impose other conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA. If and when deficiencies outlined in a CRL have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA may issue an approval letter. The FDA’s PDUFA review goal is to review such resubmissions within two or six months of receipt, depending on the type of information included. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval of a resubmitted NDA. 
NDAs receive either standard or priority review. An application for a drug that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of disease may qualify for priority review. Priority review for an NDA for a new molecular entity means the FDA will review the NDA within six months from the date that the NDA is accepted for filing by FDA. The FDA has ten months in which to complete its initial review of a standard new molecular entity NDA. The FDA does not always meet its goal dates and in certain circumstances, the goal date may be extended. Priority review does not change the standard for approval, but may expedite the approval process. 
Product candidates may qualify for review and approval under the 21 CFR Part 314, Subpart H accelerated approval pathway if the candidates are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition, provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments, and demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on an intermediate clinical endpoint. In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that is thought to predict clinical benefit, such as how a patient feels, functions, or survives, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily 
16
Table of 
Contents
or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA requires that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform confirmatory adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. Approval of a product may be withdrawn if these trials fail to verify clinical benefit or do not demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit to justify the risks associated with the product. Accelerated approval does not change the standards for approval. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under the accelerated approval pathway are subject to prior review by the FDA. If a sponsor fails to conduct any required post-approval trial with “due diligence,” the FDA may withdraw approval of the product. 
Further, on December 29, 2022, Congress enacted the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023, which included the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act (“FDORA”). Under FDORA, the FDA must specify the conditions for any post-approval trials by the date of the accelerated approval and the agency has flexibility in setting forth such conditions, which may include enrollment targets, clinical trial protocol and milestones – including the target date of trial completion. The FDA may also require, as appropriate, that certain post-approval trials be underway prior to accelerated approval or within a specified time from the date of approval. Accelerated approval sponsors must submit progress reports every six months on required post-approval trials. 
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product candidate with specific prescribing information for specific indications. If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be further limited to specific diseases, dosages or patient populations, or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. In addition, the FDA may require a sponsor to conduct additional (i.e., Phase 4) testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval, and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized. 
The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (“FDASIA”) which was enacted in 2012, made permanent the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), which requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies for most drug applications and supplements to applications, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, such original NDAs and supplements thereto must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product has been assessed to be safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric studies for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric studies are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric studies begin. The FDA may send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, maintain a current deferral or submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation. 
Patent Term Restoration and Regulatory Exclusivities
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of our product candidates, some of our United States patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND, and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, except that the period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension, and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent and within 60 days of approval. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. 
The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides periods of regulatory exclusivity for products that would serve as a reference listed drug (“RLD”) for an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) or application submitted under section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, or 505(b)(2) application. If a product is a new chemical entity (“NCE”)—generally meaning that the active moiety has never before been approved in any drug—there is a period of five years from the product’s approval during which the FDA may not accept for filing any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for a drug with the same active moiety. An ANDA or 505(b)(2) application may be submitted after four years, however, if the sponsor of the application makes a “Paragraph IV” certification. 
A product that is not an NCE may qualify for a three-year period of exclusivity if the NDA or supplement to an approved NDA contains new clinical data (other than bioavailability studies), derived from trials conducted by or for the sponsor, that were necessary for approval. In that instance, the exclusivity period does not preclude filing or review of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application; rather, the FDA is precluded from granting final approval to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) 
17
Table of 
Contents
application until three years after approval of the RLD. Additionally, the exclusivity applies only to the conditions of approval that required submission of the clinical data. 
Once the FDA accepts for filing an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application containing a Paragraph IV certification, the applicant must within 20 days provide notice to the RLD NDA holder and patent owner that the application has been submitted and provide the factual and legal basis for the applicant’s assertion that the patent is invalid or not infringed. If the NDA holder or patent owner files suit against the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant for patent infringement within 45 days of receiving the Paragraph IV notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for a period of 30 months or the resolution of the underlying suit, whichever is earlier. If the RLD has NCE exclusivity and the notice is given and suit filed during the fifth year of exclusivity, the regulatory stay extends until seven and a half years after the RLD approval. The FDA may approve the proposed product before the expiration of the regulatory stay if a court finds the patent invalid or not infringed or if the court shortens the period because the parties have failed to cooperate in expediting the litigation. 
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of marketing exclusivity available in the United States. The FDASIA made permanent the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (“BPCA”), which provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA (“Written Request”). If the Written Request does not include trials in neonates, the FDA is required to include its rationale for not requesting those trials. The FDA may request trials on approved or unapproved indications in separate Written Requests. The issuance of a Written Request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described trials. 
Expedited Programs
The FDA maintains several programs to facilitate and expedite the development and review of drug applications that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition that meet certain other criteria, including Fast Track Designation, Breakthrough Designation, Priority Review (discussed above in United States Review and Approval Processes), and the Accelerated Approval pathway (discussed above in United States Review and Approval Processes). Under the Fast Track Designation program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a fast track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. Under the Fast Track Designation program, the FDA may grant fast track designation for a product candidate if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and nonclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need. Features of Fast Track Designation include more frequent interactions with the review team, and the possibility of rolling review. 
Under the Breakthrough Designation Program, FDA may grant a drug Breakthrough Therapy Designation if it is intended to treat a serious condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement on a clinically significant endpoint over available therapies. Features of Breakthrough Therapy Designation include intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program, an organizational commitment by the agency involving senior managers in a proactive, cross-disciplinary review of the drug application, and the possibility of rolling review. 
Post-Approval Requirements
Once an approval is granted, products are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA. The FDA may withdraw the approval if, among other things, compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety or efficacy problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on product marketing or even withdrawal of approval for the product application. If new safety issues are identified following approval, the FDA may require the NDA sponsor to take certain measures, such as revising the approved labeling to reflect the new safety information, conducting post-market studies or clinical trials to assess the new safety information, and/or implementing or changing a REMS program to mitigate newly-identified risks. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws and regulations. Manufacturers and other parties involved in the drug supply chain for prescription drug products must also comply with product tracking and tracing requirements and notify the FDA of counterfeit, diverted, stolen and intentionally adulterated products or products that are otherwise unfit for distribution in the United States. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of 
18
Table of 
Contents
clinical and commercial quantities of our product candidates. Future inspections by the FDA and other regulatory agencies may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct.
Any drug products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the drug, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, drug sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. 
From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. 
Foreign Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the EU, before we may commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. 
Under the EU regulatory systems, a company may submit an MAA either under the centralized procedure or one of the national procedures, depending on the type of product. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the EC that is valid throughout the EU and in the additional countries of the European Economic Area (Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway) (“EEA”). The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicinal products produced by certain biotechnological processes; advanced therapy medicinal products (gene therapy, somatic cell therapy and tissue engineered products); medicinal products containing new active substances for specific indications such as the treatment of HIV/AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, viral diseases and other immune dysfunctions; and designated orphan medicines. For medicines that do not fall within one of the mandatory categories, an applicant still has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization as long as the medicine concerned contains a new active substance not yet authorized in the EU, is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health in the EU. Under the centralized procedure, an MAA is submitted to the EMA where it will be evaluated by the CHMP. The CHMP is responsible for conducting an initial assessment of whether a product meets the required quality, safety and efficacy requirements, and whether a product has a positive benefit/risk ratio. Under the centralized procedure, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Clock stops may extend the timeframe of evaluation of an MAA considerably beyond 210 days. Where the CHMP gives a positive opinion, it provides the opinion together with supporting documentation to the EC, who makes the final decision to grant a marketing authorization, which is issued within 67 days of receipt of the EMA’s recommendation. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA under the accelerated assessment procedure is 150 days, excluding clock stops, but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that the application is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment. The initial marketing authorization is valid for five years, but once renewed is usually valid for an unlimited period, unless the EC decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance (e.g. exposure of an insufficient number of patients to the medicinal product concerned), to mandate one additional five-year renewal. 
There are also two other possible routes to authorize products for therapeutic indications in several countries in the EU, which are available for products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure: 
•
Decentralized procedure—Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorizations in more than one EU Member State for a medicinal product that has not yet been authorized in any EU Member State and that does not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. 
•
Mutual recognition procedure—In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, 
19
Table of 
Contents
additional marketing authorizations can be sought from other EU Member States in a procedure whereby the countries concerned recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.
In both cases, as with the centralized procedure, the competent authorities of the EU Member States assess the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy before granting the marketing authorization.
When conducting clinical trials in the EU, we must adhere to the provisions of the EU Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 (“EU CTR”). The EU CTR requires, among other things, that the prior authorization of an ethics committee and the submission and approval of a clinical trial authorization application be obtained in each applicable EU Member State before commencing a clinical trial in that EU Member State. The EU CTR replaced the previous EU Clinical Trials Directive and aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the EU. For example, the EU CTR implements a coordinated procedure for authorization of clinical trials (through a centralized EU portal known as the Clinical Trials Information System) that is similar to the mutual recognition procedure for marketing authorization of medicinal products, and includes obligations on sponsors to publish clinical trial results. 
As in the United States, it may be possible in foreign countries to obtain a period of market and/or data exclusivity that would have the effect of postponing the entry into the marketplace of a competitor’s generic or biosimilar product. For example, in the EU, if any of our products receive marketing approval in the EU, we expect that we will benefit from eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of marketing exclusivity. An additional one-year extension of marketing exclusivity is possible if during the data exclusivity period we obtain an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications that is deemed to bring a significant clinical benefit compared to existing therapies for the indication. The data exclusivity period begins on the date of the product’s first marketing authorization in the EU and prevents biosimilars or generics from referencing the pharmacological, toxicological and clinical data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic marketing authorization for a period of eight years. After eight years, a biosimilar or generic MAA may be submitted and the sponsoring companies may rely on the data for the reference product. However, even with a market authorization a biosimilar or generic medicine cannot launch in the EU until two years after the data exclusivity expires (or a total of ten years after the first marketing authorization in the EU of the innovator product), or three years later (or a total of eleven years after the first marketing authorization in the EU of the innovator product) if the marketing authorization holder obtains marketing authorization for a new indication with significant clinical benefit within the eight year data exclusivity period. 
If a marketing authorization for a medicinal product in the EU is obtained, the holder of the marketing authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products. These include: 
•
Compliance with the EU’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules must be ensured. These rules can impose post-authorization trials and additional monitoring obligations. 
•
The manufacturing of authorized medicinal products, for which a separate manufacturer’s license is mandatory, must also be conducted in strict compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance, including Directive 2001/83/EC, Directive (EU) 2017/1572, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and the European Commission Guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practice. These requirements include compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients outside of the EU with the intention to import the active pharmaceutical ingredients into the EU.
•
The marketing and promotion of authorized products, including industry-sponsored continuing medical education and advertising directed toward the prescribers of products and/or the general public, are strictly regulated in the EU. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is prohibited across the EU. 
Much like the Anti-Kickback Statue prohibition in the United States, the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians or other health care professionals to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is also prohibited in the EU. The provision of benefits or advantages to induce or reward improper performance generally is usually governed by the national anti-bribery laws of EU Member States, and the Bribery Act 2010 in the United Kingdom (“UK”). Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment. EU Directive 2001/83/EC, which is the EU Directive governing medicinal products for human use, further provides that, where medicinal products are being promoted to persons qualified to prescribe or supply them, no gifts, pecuniary advantages or benefits in kind may be supplied, offered or promised to such persons unless they are inexpensive and relevant to the practice of medicine or pharmacy. This provision has been transposed into the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 and so remains applicable in the UK despite its departure from the EU.
20
Table of 
Contents
Payments made to physicians or other healthcare professionals in certain EU Member States must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his or her competent professional organization and/or the regulatory authorities of the individual EU Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the EU Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the EEA. 
The EC introduced legislative proposals in April 2023 that, if implemented, will replace the current regulatory framework in the EU for all medicines (including those for rare diseases and for children). The EC has provided the legislative proposals to the European Parliament and the European Council for their review and approval, and, in April 2024, the European Parliament proposed amendments to the legislative proposals. Once the EC’s legislative proposals are approved (with or without amendment), they will be adopted into EU law.
The UK formally left the EU on January 31, 2020. As a result of the Northern Ireland protocol, following the UK leaving the EU, the EMA remained responsible for approving novel medicines for supply in Northern Ireland under the EU centralized procedure, and a separate authorization was required to supply the same medicine in Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland). On February 27, 2023, the UK government and the EC announced a political agreement in principle to replace the Northern Ireland Protocol with a new set of arrangements, known as the “Windsor Framework.” The Windsor Framework was approved by the EU-UK Joint Committee on March 24, 2023, and the medicines aspects of the Windsor Framework have applied since January 1, 2025. This new framework fundamentally changes the previous system under the Northern Ireland Protocol, including with respect to the regulation of medicinal products in the UK. In particular, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (the “MHRA”) is now responsible for approving all medicinal products destined for the UK market (i.e., Great Britain and Northern Ireland), and the EMA no longer has any role in approving medicinal products destined for Northern Ireland under the EU centralized procedure. A single UK-wide marketing authorization will be granted by the MHRA for all novel medicinal products to be sold in the UK, enabling products to be sold in a single pack and under a single authorization throughout the UK. In addition, the new arrangements require all medicines placed on the UK market to be labelled “UK only,” indicating they are not for sale in the EU.
The MHRA has introduced changes to national licensing procedures, including procedures to prioritize access to new medicines that will benefit patients, an accelerated assessment procedure and new routes of evaluation for novel products and biotechnological products. On January 1, 2024, the MHRA put in place a new international recognition framework which means that the MHRA may have regard to decisions on the approval of marketing authorizations made by the EMA and certain other regulators when determining an application for a new UK marketing authorization. 
Coverage and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists regarding the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. In the United States, sales of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in significant part on the availability and adequacy of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include federal and state government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 
Factors payors consider in determining reimbursement are based on whether the product is: 
•
a covered benefit under its health plan; 
•
safe, effective and medically necessary; 
•
appropriate for the specific patient; 
•
cost-effective; and 
•
neither experimental nor investigational. 
Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for, examining the medical necessity of, and assessing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. Our drug candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. If third-party payors do not consider a product to 
21
Table of 
Contents
be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician ordering and patient demand for the product. 
The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for a product for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
In addition, sales of our products in other countries are also dependent, in large part, on complex coverage and reimbursement mechanisms and programs in those countries. In some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be significantly lower.
U.S. Healthcare Reform
The U.S. government and state legislatures have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended the ACA, contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales for branded prescription drugs to federal health care programs. Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals. 
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011 and subsequence legislation, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress that include aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which remain in effect through 2031. The U.S. American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. On March 11, 2021, former President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminated the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. These laws and regulations may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used. 
 Further, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act was signed into law. The Right to Try Act, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) includes several provisions that may impact our business, depending on how various aspects of the IRA are implemented. Provisions that may impact our business include a $2,000 out-of-pocket cap for Medicare Part D beneficiaries, the imposition of new manufacturer financial liability on most drugs in Medicare Part D, permitting the U.S. government to negotiate Medicare Part B and Part D pricing for certain high-cost drugs and biologics without generic or biosimilar competition, requiring companies to pay rebates to Medicare for drug prices that increase faster than inflation, and delay until January 1, 2031 the implementation of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) rebate rule that would have limited the fees that pharmacy benefit managers (“PBMs”) can charge. Further, under the IRA, orphan drugs are exempted from the Medicare drug price negotiation program, but only if they have one orphan designation and for which the only approved indication is for that disease or condition. If a product receives multiple orphan designations or has multiple approved indications, it may not qualify for the orphan drug exemption. The implementation of the IRA is currently subject to ongoing litigation challenging the 
22
Table of 
Contents
constitutionality of the IRA’s Medicare drug price negotiation program. The effects of the IRA on our business and the healthcare industry in general is not yet known. 
On December 2, 2020, the HHS published a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through PBMs, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between PBMs and manufacturers. Implementation of this change and new safe harbors for point-of-sale reductions in price for prescription pharmaceutical products and PBM service fees are currently under review by the current United States presidential administration and may be amended or repealed. Further, on December 31, 2020, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) published a new rule, effective January 1, 2023, requiring manufacturers to ensure the full value of co-pay assistance is passed on to the patient or these dollars will count toward the Average Manufacturer Price and Best Price calculation of the drug (“Accumulator Rule”). On May 17, 2022, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia granted the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America's (PhRMA) motion for summary judgement invalidating the Accumulator Rule. We cannot predict how the implementation of and any further changes to this rule will affect our business. Although a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, and the current United States presidential administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures. Both the current United States presidential administration and Congress have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs. 
Federal and state legislatures and health agencies may continue to focus on additional health care reform measures in the future that will impose additional constraints on prices and reimbursements for our marketed products. In addition, an emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. 
There have been several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, evaluate the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government healthcare program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, President Trump reversed some of former President Biden’s executive orders, including rescinding Executive Order 14087 entitled “Lowering Prescription Drug Costs for Americans.” President Trump may issue new executive orders designed to impact drug pricing. A number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective.
Individual states in the United States have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to report to state agencies when they introduce new drugs to market with prices over a certain threshold, or when they increase the price of a drug over a certain threshold. If healthcare policies or reforms intended to curb healthcare costs are adopted, the prices that we charge for any approved product may be limited, our commercial opportunity may be limited and/or our revenues from sales of our product and any future products, if approved, may be negatively impacted.
It is possible that the above-mentioned measures, as currently enacted or may be amended in the future, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, more rigorous coverage criteria, and new payment methodologies and additional downward pressure on coverage and payment and the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of additional cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our approved product or products. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted in the United States or outside of the United States, or whether regulatory changes, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on our product candidates, if any, may be. 
Other Healthcare Laws 
Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Our business operations and any current or future arrangements with third-party payors, healthcare providers and physicians may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we develop, market, sell and distribute any drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. In the United States, these laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, physician transparency and patient data privacy and security laws and regulations, including but not limited to those described below. 
•
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing any remuneration (including any kickback, bride or 
23

certain rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity need not have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. Violations are subject to civil and criminal fines and penalties for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved, imprisonment, and exclusion from government healthcare programs; 
•
The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act (“FCA”), which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment or approval that are false, fictitious or fraudulent; knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false statement or record material to a false or fraudulent claim or obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. In addition, the government may assert that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. The FCA also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery; 
•
The federal civil monetary penalties laws, which impose civil fines for, among other things, the offering or transfer or remuneration to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state health care program, unless an exception applies. The government may also assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim under federal civil monetary penalties laws; 
•
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) imposes criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme or attempting to execute a scheme, to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense or falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity need not have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation; 
•
HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (“HITECH”) and their respective implementing regulations, imposes, among other things, specified requirements on covered entities and their business associates relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information including mandatory contractual terms and required implementation of technical safeguards of such information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates in some cases, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions; 
•
The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “ACA”) imposed new annual reporting requirements for certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, for certain payments and “transfers of value” provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain other licensed health care practitioners and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by such physicians and their immediate family members; and 
•
Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party-payors, including private insurers, and may be broader in scope than their federal equivalents; state and foreign laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state and foreign laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to drug pricing and payments and other transfers of value 
24

to physicians and other healthcare providers and restrict marketing practices or require disclosure of marketing expenditures and pricing information; state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances. In addition, some states have passed laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the April 2003 Office of Inspector General Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and/or the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America’s Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals. These data privacy and security laws may differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, which may complicate compliance efforts. 
In addition, pharmaceutical manufacturers may also be subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws and regulations, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and that potentially harm consumers. 
The distribution of drugs and biological products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
 In the United States, to help patients afford our approved product, we may use programs to assist them, including patient assistance programs and co-pay coupon programs for eligible patients. Government enforcement agencies have shown increased interest in pharmaceutical companies’ product and patient assistance programs, including reimbursement support services, and a number of investigations into these programs have resulted in significant civil and criminal settlements. In addition, at least one insurer has directed its network pharmacies to no longer accept co-pay coupons for certain specialty drugs the insurer identified. Our co-pay coupon programs could become the target of similar insurer actions. In addition, in November 2013, the CMS issued guidance to the issuers of qualified health plans sold through the ACA’s marketplaces encouraging such plans to reject patient cost-sharing support from third parties and indicating that the CMS intends to monitor the provision of such support and may take regulatory action to limit it in the future. The CMS subsequently issued a rule requiring individual market qualified health plans to accept third-party premium and cost-sharing payments from certain government-related entities. In September 2014, the Office of Inspector General (the “OIG”) of the HHS issued a Special Advisory Bulletin warning manufacturers that they may be subject to sanctions under the federal anti-kickback statute and/or civil monetary penalty laws if they do not take appropriate steps to exclude Part D beneficiaries from using co-pay coupons. Accordingly, companies exclude these Part D beneficiaries from using co-pay coupons. It is possible that changes in insurer policies regarding co-pay coupons and/or the introduction and enactment of new legislation or regulatory action could restrict or otherwise negatively affect these patient support programs, which could result in fewer patients using affected products, and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our sales, business and financial condition. 
Third party patient assistance programs that receive financial support from companies have become the subject of enhanced government and regulatory scrutiny. The OIG has established guidelines that suggest that it is lawful for pharmaceutical manufacturers to make donations to charitable organizations who provide co-pay assistance to Medicare patients, provided that such organizations, among other things, are bona fide charities, are entirely independent of and not controlled by the manufacturer, provide aid to applicants on a first-come basis according to consistent financial criteria and do not link aid to use of a donor’s product. However, donations to patient assistance programs have received some negative publicity and have been the subject of multiple government enforcement actions, related to allegations regarding their use to promote branded pharmaceutical products over other less costly alternatives. Specifically, in recent years, there have been multiple settlements resulting out of government claims challenging the legality of their patient assistance programs under a variety of federal and state laws. It is possible that we may make grants to independent charitable foundations that help financially needy patients with their premium, co-pay and co-insurance obligations. If we choose to do so, and if we or our vendors or donation recipients are deemed to fail to comply with relevant laws, regulations or evolving government guidance in the operation of these programs, we could be subject to damages, fines, penalties or other criminal, civil or administrative sanctions or enforcement actions. We cannot ensure that our compliance controls, policies and procedures will be sufficient to protect against acts of our employees, business partners or vendors that may violate the laws or regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Regardless of whether we have complied with the law, a government investigation could impact our business practices, harm our reputation, divert the attention of management, increase our expenses and reduce the availability of foundation support for our patients who need assistance. 
The full scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform. Federal and state enforcement bodies have continued to increase their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other related governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, reputational harm, additional oversight and reporting obligations if 
25

we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar settlement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to similar actions, penalties and sanctions. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert a company’s attention from its business. 
Pharmaceutical Price Reporting
A number of government pricing programs create certain price reporting obligations. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, a participating manufacturer is required to pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for its covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by the state Medicaid program as a condition of having federal funds being made available for drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Those rebates are based on pricing data reported by the manufacturer on a monthly and quarterly basis to CMS. These data include the average manufacturer price and, in the case of innovator products, the best price for each drug, which, in general, represents the lowest price available from the manufacturer to any wholesaler, retailer, provider, health maintenance organization, nonprofit entity, or governmental entity in the United States in any pricing structure, calculated to include all sales and associated rebates, discounts, and other price concessions.
The ACA (addressed further above in the section titled “—U.S. Healthcare Reform”) made significant changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, and CMS issued a final regulation to implement the changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program under the ACA. CMS also issued a final regulation that modified prior Medicaid Drug Rebate Program regulations to permit reporting multiple best price figures with regard to value based purchasing arrangements; and provide definitions for “line extension,” “new formulation,” and related terms, with the practical effect of expanding the scope of drugs considered to be line extensions that are subject to an alternative rebate formula. 
Federal law requires that a manufacturer also participate in the 340B Drug Pricing program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs to a specified “covered entities,” including community health centers and other entities that receive certain federal grants, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula, which is based on the average manufacturer price and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.
Further, the IRA establishes a Medicare Part D inflation rebate schemes (the first rebate period is in fourth quarter 2022 through third quarter 2023) and a drug price negotiation program, with the first negotiated prices to take effect in 2026. It also makes several changes to the Medicare Part D benefit, including the creation of a new manufacturer discount program in place of the current coverage gap discount program (beginning in 2025).
Finally, in order to be eligible to have its products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs and purchased by the Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”), Department of Defense (“DoD”), Public Health Service, and Coast Guard (the “Big Four agencies”) and certain federal grantees, a manufacturer is required to participate in the VA Federal Supply Schedule (“FSS”) pricing program, established under Section 603 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992. Under this program, the manufacturer is obligated to make its covered drugs available for procurement on an FSS contract and charge a price to the Big Four agencies that is no higher than the Federal Ceiling Price (“FCP”), which is a price calculated pursuant to a statutory formula. The FCP is derived from a calculated price point called the “non-federal average manufacturer price” (“Non FAMP”), which the manufacturer calculates and reports to the VA on a quarterly and annual basis. Pursuant to applicable law, knowing provision of false information in connection with a Non FAMP filing can subject a manufacturer to significant penalties for each item of false information. The FSS contract also contains extensive disclosure and certification requirements. Under Section 703 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2008, the manufacturer is required to pay quarterly rebates to DoD on utilization of its innovator products that are dispensed through DoD’s Tricare network pharmacies to Tricare beneficiaries. The rebates are calculated as the difference between the annual Non FAMP and FCP for the calendar year that the product was dispensed.
