of the Star Equity Holders, to acquire a controlling 51% interest in Star, an Israeli corporation engaged as a supplier of generators

Comparability of Financial Information

Our historical operations
and statements of assets and liabilities may not be comparable to our operations and statements of assets and liabilities as a result
of the Business Combination and becomes a public company.

Business Combination and Public Company Costs

On December 22, 2023, we
consummated the merger contemplated by the Business Combination, with Old Nukk surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary or Brilliant.

Upon the closing of the Business
Combination, Brilliant’s certificate of incorporation was amended and restated to, among other things, set the total number of authorized
shares of capital to 55,000,000 shares, of which 40,000,000 shares were designated common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, and of which
15,000,000 shares were designated preferred stock, $0.0001 par value per share.

Upon the consummation of
the Business Combination, each share of Old Nukk common stock issued and outstanding was cancelled and converted into the right to receive
a pro-rata portion of 1,312,494 shares of the Company’s common stock. Additionally, a backstop pool of 26,668, 40% of the aggregate
number of Brilliant Ordinary shares and Brilliant Rights in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, was issued to certain
holders of Brilliant Ordinary Shares, Brilliant Rights, and Brilliant Warrants.

Old Nukk was deemed the accounting
acquirer in the Business Combination based on an analysis of the criteria outlined in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
805. The determination was primarily based on Old Nukk’s shareholders prior to the Business Combination having a majority of the
voting interests in the combined company, Old Nukk’s ability to exert control over the majority of the board of directors of the
combined company, and given the board of directors election and retention provisions, Old Nukk’s ability to maintain control of
the board of directors on a go-forward basis, Old Nukk’s senior management comprising the senior management of the combined company;
and old Nukk’s operations prior to the Business Combination comprising the ongoing operations of the combined company. Accordingly,
for accounting purposes, the Business Combination was treated as the equivalent of Old Nukk issuing stock for the net assets of Brilliant,
accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of Brilliant are stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets
recorded.

48

As a result of the Business
Combination, we became a Nasdaq listed company, which will require us to hire additional personnel and implement procedures to address
public company regulatory requirements and customary practices. We expect to incur annual expenses as a public company for, among other
things, directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, director fees and additional internal and external accounting, legal
and administrative resources, including increased audit, compliance and legal fees.

Trading volume. 
We
define trading volume as the total U.S. dollar equivalent value of spot matched trades transacted between a buyer and seller through our
platform during the period of measurement. Trading Volume represents the product of the quantity of assets transacted and the trade price
at the time the transaction was executed. As trading activity directly impacts transaction revenue, we believe this measure is a reflection
of liquidity on our order books, trading health, and the underlying growth of the digital assets economy.

Generally, Trading Volume
on our platform is primarily influenced by the price of digital assets, digital asset volatility, and macroeconomic conditions. In periods
of high digital asset prices and digital asset volatility, we have experienced correspondingly high levels of Trading Volumes on our platform.

Financial services revenue

represents the top-line revenue generated from trades, before considering the costs associated with the generation of financial services
revenue.

Financial services profit
(loss)
 is measured as financial services revenue, less costs which include amortization of intangible assets   which consist
of license and banking infrastructure acquired on Match acquisition, introducing broker fees, banking, and trading fees incurred associated
with delivery of our services. These intangible assets have been fully amortized as of September 30, 2023. For the year ended September
30, 2024, we saw a 50.0% decrease in trading volume over the year ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in trading volume had a similar
effect on all other KPIs.

Average cost per trade

is driven by financial services costs. Our average cost per trade decreased significantly as a direct result of zero amortization
of intangible assets included in direct costs for the year ended September 30, 2024, as these assets have been fully amortized as of
prior year.   

Active clients

Gross trading margin 
is a metric that measures financial
services revenue to trading volume.

Components of Results of Operations

Revenue 
consists of
general support services revenue and financial services revenue.

General support services
revenue
 represents general support services revenue earned from an affiliate who has engaged us to provide general support services,
including operational reporting and technical support infrastructure, website hosting and marketing solutions, accounting maintenance,
risk monitoring services, new account processing and customer care and continued support. Support services revenue is provided for in
the contract with the affiliate and recognized over the period the general support services are rendered.

Financial services revenue

represents transaction revenue earned from customers who submit requests to process a payment to a third party, often involving exchanging
one fiat currency to another or to a digital asset as part of the transaction. Transaction revenue is generated primarily from transaction
fees applied to the amount of the transaction requested by the customer. The transaction fee earned is based on the price and quantity
of the fiat or digital asset that is converted. Financial services revenue is recognized at the time the transaction completes. Financial
services revenue is directly correlated with Trading Volume, which is driven by the number of conversion transactions requested by customers.

Cost of revenues 
consists
of cost of revenue – general support services and cost of revenue – financial services.

Cost of revenue - general
support services
 consists of costs paid to an affiliate that performs the general support services for our customer.

Cost of revenue
– financial services
 consists of costs of completing our payment processing transactions, including broker fees, banking, and
trading fees incurred associated with our financial services revenue. Additionally, for the year ended September 30, 2023, cost of financial
services also included amortization of intangible assets which consist of license and banking infrastructure from an acquisition.

Operating expenses

consist of advertising, professional fees, compensation and related
benefits, amortization of intangible assets, other general and administrative, and impairment loss.

Advertising
 consists
of advertising program costs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.

Professional fees

consists of professional services, such as audit fees, legal service fees, advisory fees, and consulting fees., and software subscriptions
for support services.

Compensation and related
benefits
 consists of personnel related expenses incurred in operating our business, including cash compensation and our benefit programs.

Amortization of intangible
assets
 consists of amortization expense recorded on acquired intangible assets with a definite useful life.

Bad debt expense –
related parties consists
 of affiliate receivable balances that were written off after we expended exhaustive efforts at collection
and have determined the associated balance to be uncollectible. Because this component fluctuates with market conditions, bad debt expense
can vary widely between periods.

50

Other general and administrative

consists of personnel-related expenses incurred to support our business, including executive, customer support, compliance, finance, human
resources, legal, and other support operations, and include rent, filing fee, platform fee, travel and entertainment, miscellaneous taxes,
and other miscellaneous items.

Impairment loss
 consists
of impairment losses recognized on long-lived assets where there was a triggering event that indicated a long-lived assets carrying amount
may not be recoverable. The impairment loss represents the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value. Because these components
fluctuate with market conditions, impairment loss can vary widely between periods.

Other (expense) income,
net
 consists of interest expense, gain (loss) on extinguishment of liabilities, and other income.

Interest expense
 on
debt include fixed interest rates, as well as amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs.

Gain (loss) on extinguishment
of liabilities
 consists of liabilities with unrelated parties, including accounts payable and debt, where the carrying
value of the liability exceeded or were less than, respectively, the fair value of the consideration transferred. Additionally, certain
liabilities  with related parties based on the facts and circumstances of each transaction would also be recognized as
a gain (loss) on extinguishment as a component of other (expense) income, net.

Because these components
fluctuate with market conditions, other (expense) income, net can vary widely between periods.

Comparison For the Year Ended September 30, 2024 Versus the Year
Ended September 30, 2023

Revenues

For the years ended September
30, 2024, we had revenue from general support services decreased $14,400,000, or 75.0%. The decrease was attributable to the customer
contract being terminated January 1, 2024.

For the year ended September
30, 2024, financial services revenue decreased $984,181, or 46.9%. The decrease was attributable to a significant decrease in financial
services revenue resulting from the closure of our primary USD Banking rails when Signature and Silvergate closed in March 2023.

Costs of Revenues

For the year ended September
30, 2024, our cost of general support services decreased $14,125,000, or 75.2%. The decrease was attributable to the supplier contract
being terminated January 1, 2024.

For the year ended September
30, 2024, cost of financial services amounted to $264,945, as compared to $2,865,783 for the year ended September 30, 2023, a decrease
of $2,600,838, or 90.8%. The decrease was primarily attributable to the $2,106,404 of amortization expense attributed to acquired intangible
that were fully amortized during the year ended September 30, 2023. The remaining decrease of $494,434 was primarily attributable to the
overall decrease in trading activity during the year ended September 30, 2024.

Gross Profit (Loss)

While our gross margin from
general support services for the year ended September 30, 2024 decreased $275,000, or 64.7%, from the year ended September 30, 2023, our
gross margin percentage increased to 3.1% for the year ended September 30, 2024 from 2.2% for the year ended September 30, 2023. The increase
in our gross margin percentage for the general support services for the year ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the year ended September
30, 2023 was attributed to the $25,000 monthly decrease in our cost of general support services which took effect May 1, 2023.

Our gross margin from financial
services for the year ended September 30, 2024 increased $1,616,657 from the year ended September 30, 2023, an improvement of 210.5%.
Gross margin increased to 76.2% for the year ended September 30, 2024 from (36.6)% for the year ended September 30, 2023. The increase
in our gross margin percentage for the financial services for the year ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the year ended September
30, 2023 was primarily attributed to the decrease in cost for financial services driven by the $2,106,404 of amortization expense of acquired
intangible assets during the year ended September 30, 2023 that did not recur during the year ended September 30, 2023 as an impairment
loss that was recorded during the year ended September 30, 2023 on the associated acquired intangible assets reduced the carrying value
of the acquired intangible assets to zero. When this is excluded from the year ended September 30, 2023 results, the gross margin has
decreased $489,747, or 36.6%, while our gross margin percentage has increased to 76.2% for the year ended September 30, 2024 from 63.8%
for the year ended September 30, 2023. The resulting increase in our gross margin percentages was primarily attributable to a slight decrease
in introducing broker fees during the year ended September 30, 2024.

52

Operating Expenses

Advertising

For the year ended September
30, 2024, advertising expense decreased by $11,401, or 20.4%, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily
attributable to our decreased advertising activities within our financial services segment. We expect that our advertising expense will
continue to decrease in future periods considering the pending disposal of our financial services segment.

Professional fees

For the year ended September
30, 2024, professional fees increased by $4,310,389, or 177.8%, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2023. The significant increase
was primarily attributable to an increase in advisory service fees of $3,648,100, consulting fees of approximately $697,000, and legal
fees of approximately $280,000 attributed to additional costs associated with the December 2023 business combination, offset by a decrease
audit fees of approximately $206,000 attributed to one time costs attributed to transitioning from a private company to a public company.
We expect that our professional fees will increase in the near future as consultancy agreements were entered into during the fourth quarter
with outsourced executives and other personnel of the Company that we anticipate to be in place for the entire fiscal year 2025.

Compensation and related benefits

For the year ended September
30, 2024, our compensation and related benefits increased by $136,023, or 16.5%, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2023. The
increase was mainly attributable to increased management and personnel in our financial services segment. We expect that our compensation
and related benefits will decrease significantly considering the pending disposal of our financial services segment. However, we expect
an overall increase in compensation expenses in the near future for certain executives, directors and other personnel outside of our financial
services segment.

Amortization of intangible assets

For the year ended September 30, 2024, our amortization of intangible
assets decreased by $259,898, or 95.0%, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was mainly attributable
to the impairment loss recorded on our acquired intangible assets during the year ended September 30, 2023 that reduced the carrying value
of the acquired intangible assets to zero. We expect that our amortization of intangible assets will increase in the near future if the
pending acquisition of Star completes during fiscal year 2025.

Bad debt expense – related parties

For the year ended September
30, 2024, our bad debt expense – related parties increased by $4,961,228, or 420.5%, as compared to the year ended September 30,
2023. The increase was mainly attributable to the write-off of a significant receivable in relation to the terminated GSA agreement. This
increase in bad debt expense included $4,800,000 in revenues for the year ended September 30, 2024, as well as a portion of revenues recognized
during the year ended September 30, 2023, which were never collected.

Other general and administrative expenses

For the year ended September
30, 2024, total other general and administrative expenses increased by $443,210, or 98.5%, as compared to the year ended September 30,
2023. The increase was mainly attributable to additional costs associated with operating as a public company, including an increase in
D&O insurance of approximately $202,000, filing fees of approximately $265,000, and an increase in compliance fees of approximately
$29,000, offset by a decrease in rent of approximately $10,000. We expect that other general and administrative expenses will increase
in the near future if the pending acquisition of Star completes during fiscal year 2025.

53

Impairment loss

At each reporting period end, we assessed our long-lived assets for
any impairment and concluded that there were indicators of impairment as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 and determined that the estimated
undiscounted cash flows related to certain long-lived assets were less than their carrying amounts for both periods. For the years ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, we considered the investee’s series of operating losses and global economic environment, and recognized
an impairment loss of $391,217 and $6,210,783 for the year ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the year ended September
30, 2023, we were not able to realize the financial projections provided by an entity acquired at the time of the intangible assets purchase
and determined to recognize an impairment loss of $5,703,539, reducing the carrying value of the acquired intangible assets to zero. These
impairment losses for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled $391,217 and $11,914,322, respectively, a decrease of $11,523,105,
or 96.7%.

Other (Expense) Income

Other (expense) income includes
loss from equity method investment and other miscellaneous income (expense).

For the year ended September
30, 2024, other income, net, increased $5,624,697, or 16,166.2%, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2023. The increase was attributable
to a gain on termination of GSS GSA agreement – related parties of approximately $6,083,000, an increase in gain on settlement of
due to affiliates of approximately $192,000, and a decrease in foreign currency exchange gains of approximately $24,000, offset by a net
loss on settlement of vendor obligations of approximately $77,000, an increase in interest expense on debt-related parties of approximately
$205,000, an increase in interest expense due to amortization of debt discounts on convertible and non-convertible notes of approximately
$316,000, and an increase in interest expense on convertible and non-convertible notes of approximately $27,000.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We believe that our existing
cash, exclusive of customer custodial cash, and the $10.0 million we raised through the sale of our common stock and stock purchase warrants
to investors in December 2024 through a private placement will be sufficient in both the short and long term to meet our requirements
and plans for cash, including meeting our working capital and capital expenditure requirements. Our ability to meet our requirements and
plans for cash, including meeting our working capital and capital expenditure requirements, will depend on many factors, including completing
the acquisition of a controlling interest of Star, the successful integration of Star into our operations, our growth, our ability to
shift from financial services sector to defense sector, attracting and retaining key employees, and overall economic conditions. We anticipate
satisfying our short-term cash requirements with our existing cash and the $10.0 million raised in the December 2024 private placement
and may satisfy our long-term cash requirements with cash on hand or with proceeds from a future equity or debt financing.

To the extent that current
and anticipated future sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our future business activities and cash and other requirements, we
may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. The sale of additional equity would result in additional dilution to our
stockholders. The incurrence of additional debt financing would result in debt service obligations and the instruments governing such
debt could provide for operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. Even if debt financing is available, the
cost of additional financing may be significantly higher than our current debt.

Critical Accounting Estimates

Our consolidated financial
statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation
of consolidated financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenue, costs, and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions
that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from our estimates. To the extent
that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition,
operating results, and cash flows will be affected.

See Note 3. Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies of the Notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K
for a summary of significant accounting policies and significant estimates and assumptions and their effects on our financial statements.
Below are the significant estimates and assumptions that we consider critical because they involve a significant amount of estimation
uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

Acquired intangible assets

We determined that intangible
assets represent critical accounting estimates, as they involve significant judgment, estimates, and assumptions and to the extent that
our estimates and assumptions materially change or if actual circumstances differ from those in the assumptions, our financial statements
could be materially impacted.

Acquired intangible assets
are initially valued at fair value using generally accepted valuation methods appropriate for the type of intangible asset. Intangible
assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment if indicators of impairment
arise. Intangible assets assessed as having indefinite lives are not amortized, but are assessed for indicators that the useful life is
no longer indefinite or for indicators of impairment each period. Indicators we review, as applicable, include whether there has been
a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which our assets are being used, a significant adverse change in legal factors
affecting our assets, customer attrition, and/or a cash flow loss. Due to the dynamic nature of our business and the regulatory environment
in which we operate, it is not practicable to model sensitivity of the valuation of these assets to these factors. Each reporting period,
we evaluate the estimated remaining useful life of our intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision
to the remaining period of amortization. We did not identify indicators of impairment of our intangible assets during the year ended September
30, 2024. We identified indicators of impairment of our acquired intangible assets during the year ended September 30, 2023 and recorded
an impairment loss for $5,703,539, the amount the carrying value of the associated acquired intangible assets exceeded the estimated undiscounted
cash flows associated with the respective acquired intangible assets.

Investments

We hold two investments in
privately held company in the form of equity securities without readily determinable fair values, one of which we do not have a controlling
interest or significant influence in and one of which we do not have a controlling interest but we do have significant influence. The
investment where we do not hold a controlling interest and do not have significant influence in is accounted for under the measurement
alternative method (“the measurement alternative”) and are measured at cost, less impairment, subject to upward and downward
adjustments resulting from observable price changes for identical or similar investments of the same issuer (“pricing adjustments”).
The investment where we do not hold a controlling interest and do have significant influence in is measured at cost and adjusted for our
share of operating results, capital contributions and distributions (referred to as the equity method).

56

We determined that valuation
of privately-held strategic investments represents a critical accounting estimate because impairment evaluations and pricing adjustments
involve significant judgment, estimates, and assumptions, and to the extent that these estimates and assumptions change materially or
if actual circumstances differ from those in the assumptions, our financial statements could be materially impacted.

Pricing adjustments
:
Pricing adjustments require quantitative assessments of the fair value of our strategic investments, which may require the use of unobservable
inputs. Pricing adjustments are determined by using various valuation methodologies and involve the use of estimates using the best information
available, which may include cash flow projections or other available market data.

Impairment:
 Privately-held
strategic investments are evaluated quarterly for impairment. Our qualitative analysis includes a review of indicators such as: operating
results when available, business prospects of the investees, changes in the regulatory and macroeconomic environment, observable price
changes in similar transactions, and general market conditions of the geographical area or industry in which our investees operate. If
indicators of impairment exist, we prepare quantitative measurements of the fair value of our equity investments using an undiscounted
cash flow model that uses unobservable inputs including expected volatility, expected time to liquidity, adjustments for other company-specific
developments, and the rights and obligations of the securities we hold. When the quantitative remeasurements of fair value indicate an
impairment exists, we write down the investment to its current fair value. We identified indicators of impairment of our investments during
the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and recorded an impairment loss of $391,217 and $6,210,783, respectively. The impairment loss
recognized reduced the carrying value of all investments to zero as of September 30, 2024.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue using
the following five steps: 1) identification of a contract with a customer; 2) identification of the performance obligation(s) in the contract;
3) determination of the transaction price; 4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligation(s) in the contract; and
5) recognition of revenue when, or as, the performance obligation(s) are satisfied. The Company’s revenues are derived primarily
from two sources: general support services and financial services. Thus, the Company disaggregates the revenue earned into these two segments.
For additional segment disclosures, refer to Note 19 of our consolidated financial statements. We maintain written agreements that sets
out the terms of the relationship, including payment terms.

For general support services,
the Company generates revenue by providing general support services to an affiliate, which include operational reporting and technical
support infrastructure, website hosting and marketing solutions, accounting maintenance, risk monitoring services, new account processing
and customer care and continued support. Our written agreement for general support services is in the form of a written general services
agreement (“GSA”), which specifies minimum monthly payments. We determined our general support services contain multiple performance
obligations that are combined into one unit of accounting that is satisfied over time and recognizes the associated general support services
revenue as services are rendered.

For financial services, the
Company generates revenue by providing payment processing services, often involving exchanging one fiat currency to another or to a digital
asset as part of the transaction. Our written agreement for financial services is in the form of a written service agreement that outlines
the basis and flow of the various payment services we provide. The service agreement states that a transaction agreement, which sets out
the services to be provided at the transaction level, detailing all transaction fees and payment settlement information, is to be issued
to the client for each instance where the details of an over-the-counter trade to be executed during the conversion/payment settlement
process, are confirmed by both parties. We determined our performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time as our payment services
are delivered for at an individual transaction level, customer contracts are open ended, containing no termination penalty and the pricing
for each transaction is set for each individual transaction based on the price and quantity of the fiat or digital asset that is converted.

57

In connection with our analysis
of principal vs agent considerations, we evaluated the specified services that we provide based o
n
the terms of our written agreements with customers and considered whether we control the services before they are provided to the customer,
including the three indicators of control. Based upon this analysis and our specific facts and circumstances, we concluded that we are

                                            the fulfillment software, technology, customer sales and marketing and risk management technology

                                            the services of its supplier. We set the price of the general support services through an
                                            executed contract with the customer and

                                            for the fulfillment of the fiat currency or digital asset. The price for the fiat currency
                                            or digital asset as the price is a market rate established by users of the platform, accordingly
                                            we do not set the price for the fiat currency or digital asset that is being exchanged.

Therefore,

we report revenue on a gross basis inclusive of all supplier costs for our general support services and on a net basis for our
financial services.

Stock-based Compensation

We account for share-based
payments that involve the issuance of shares of our common stock to employees and nonemployees and meet the criteria for share-based awards
as stock-based compensation expense based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The Company has elected to recognize the adjustment
to stock-based compensation expense in the period in which forfeitures occur. We recognize compensation expense for awards with only service
conditions on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.

If factors change, and we
utilize different assumptions including the probability of achieving performance conditions, share-based compensation cost on future award
grants may differ significantly from share-based compensation cost recognized on past award grants. If there are any modifications or
cancellations of the underlying unvested securities, we may be required to accelerate any remaining unearned share-based compensation
cost or incur incremental cost. Share-based compensation cost affects our compensation and benefits expenses.

Warrants

Classification:
 The
Company determines the accounting classification of warrants it issues as either liability or equity classified by first assessing whether
the warrants meet liability classification in accordance with ASC 480-10, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics
of both Liabilities and Equity (“ASC 480”), then in accordance with ASC 815-40 (“ASC 815”), Accounting for Derivative
Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own Stock. Under ASC 480, warrants are considered liability
classified if the warrants are mandatorily redeemable, obligate the Company to settle the warrants or the underlying shares by paying
cash or other assets, or warrants that must or may require settlement by issuing variable number of shares. If warrants do not meet liability
classification under ASC 480, the Company assesses the requirements under ASC 815, which states that contracts that require or may require
the issuer to settle the contract for cash are liabilities recorded at fair value, irrespective of the likelihood of the transaction occurring
that triggers the net cash settlement feature. If the warrants do not require liability classification under ASC 815, and in order to
conclude equity classification, the Company also assesses whether the warrants are indexed to its Common Stock and whether the warrants
are classified as equity under ASC 815 or other applicable GAAP. After all relevant assessments, the Company concludes whether the warrants
are classified as liability or equity. Liability classified warrants require fair value accounting at issuance and subsequent to initial
issuance with all changes in fair value after the issuance date recorded in the statements of operations. Equity classified warrants only
require fair value accounting at issuance with no changes recognized subsequent to the issuance date.

58

Valuation:
 The fair
value of our equity classified stock purchase warrants are valued utilizing Level 3 inputs. using a Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation
model. The fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions, including the estimated
volatility of our stock price over the term of the stock purchase warrant and the estimated period of time that we expect third parties
to hold the stock purchase warrants. The risk-free interest rate assumption we use is based upon United States Treasury interest rates
appropriate for the expected life of the stock purchase warrant. We use the historical volatility of our common stock in order to estimate
future stock price trends. We expect third parties to hold their stock purchase warrants for the contractual term as we do not have any
history to support a shorter term and do not anticipate stock purchase warrants to be exercised prior to the end of the term. Our expected
dividend rate is zero since we do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable
future. The aforementioned inputs entered into the option valuation model we use to fair value our stock purchase warrants are subjective
estimates and changes to these estimates will cause the fair value of our stock purchase warrants and related debt issuance discount we
recognize to vary.

Income taxes

We determined that income
taxes involve critical accounting estimates because management makes significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments to determine our
provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets, and
to the extent that our estimates and assumptions materially change, or if actual circumstances differ materially from those in the assumptions,
our financial statements could be materially impacted.

We utilize the asset and liability
method for computing our income tax provision. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the expected future consequences of temporary
differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as operating loss, capital loss, and tax credit
carryforwards, using enacted tax rates. We assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income
and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. Assessing the need for a valuation allowance
requires a great deal of judgement and we consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether it is more
likely than not that our deferred tax assets are recoverable. We evaluate all available evidence including, but not limited to, history
of earnings and losses, forecasts of future taxable income, and the weight of evidence that can be objectively verified. See 
Note 16.
Income taxes
 of the Notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K
for details of changes in our valuation allowance for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if
it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits
of the position. The tax benefits recognized from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than
50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized within provision
for income taxes. See Note 16 - Income taxes of the Notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K for details of changes in unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.

For U.S. federal tax purposes,
digital asset transactions are treated on the same tax principles as property transactions. We recognize a gain or loss when digital assets
are exchanged for other property, in the amount of the difference between the fair market value of the property received and the tax basis
of the exchanged digital assets. Receipts of digital assets in exchange for goods or services are included in taxable income at the fair
market value on the date of receipt.

59

Legal and other contingencies 

We are subject to various
legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain, and such uncertainty
may be enhanced due to the industry in which we operate. We record a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the
amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. In addition, we record recoveries of these losses
when it is probable that they will be collected. These estimates are highly sensitive to change and involve variables that are not completely
within our control nor practicable to model, including decisions made by regulators and settlement negotiations. Resolution of legal and
other contingencies in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on our financial condition
and results of operations.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

For information about recently
issued accounting standards, refer to Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements appearing elsewhere in this report.

Foreign Currency Risk

Foreign currency transaction risk

Revenues, expenses, and financial
results of our foreign subsidiaries are recorded in the functional currency of these subsidiaries. Our foreign currency exposure is primarily
related to transactions denominated in British Pounds attributable to cash, customer custodial funds and customer custodial cash liabilities
and intercompany transactions where the transaction currency is different from a subsidiary’s functional currency. Changes in foreign
exchange rates, and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our results of operations
as expressed in U.S. dollars. We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our results of operations as a result
of gains or losses on the settlement and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are
not the functional currency of the respective entity.

If an adverse 10% foreign
currency exchange rate change was applied to the largest foreign currency exposure (e.g. British Pound) or to all foreign currency exposures
in aggregate, of monetary assets, liabilities, and commitments denominated in currencies other than its functional currency as of September
30, 2024 and 2023, it would not have a material impact on our financial results.

From time to time, we may
enter into derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. It is difficult
to predict the impact hedging activities would have on our results of operations. Additionally, the volatility of exchange rates depends
on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy. Our international operations increase our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations
and, as a result, such fluctuations could have a material impact on our future results of operations and cash flows.

Foreign currency translation risk

Fluctuations in functional
currencies from our net investment in international subsidiaries expose us to foreign currency translation risk, where changes in foreign
currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations upon translation into U.S. dollars. See the consolidated statements
of comprehensive income (loss) in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for translation adjustments for the years ended September
30, 2024 and 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, a 10% increase or decrease in foreign currency exchange rates used in translating
the financial statements of subsidiaries with functional currencies other than our reporting currency would not have a material impact
on our financial results.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

We are a smaller reporting
company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders

of Nukkleus, Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet of Nukkleus, Inc. (the Company) as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 and the related consolidated statements of operations
and comprehensive loss, consolidated statement of changes in stockholders’ equity (deficit), and consolidated statement of cash
flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.

Going concern

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has
suffered recurring losses from operations and has a working capital deficit that raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue
as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2023

NUKKLEUS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 – 
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Nukkleus Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries,
are financial technology companies focused on providing software, technology solutions, customer sales and marketing, and risk management
technology hardware and software solutions packages for the worldwide retail foreign exchange (“FX”) trading industry and
payment services from one fiat currency to another or to digital assets.

Basis of Presentation and Principles of
Consolidation:
 On December 22, 2023 (the “Closing Date”), Brilliant Acquisition Corp (“Brilliant”) entered
into a business combination agreement (the “Business Combination”) with each of the shareholders of Nukkleus Inc. (“Old
Nukk”). Pursuant to the Business Combination, Brilliant acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock from the
Old Nukk shareholders. For more information on this transaction see Note 5.

On the Closing Date, and in connection with the closing of the Business
Combination, Brilliant changed its name to Nukkleus Inc (the “Company”) and the Company’s common stock began trading
on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol NUKK. Old Nukk was deemed the accounting acquirer in the Business Combination based on an analysis
of the criteria outlined in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805, 
Business Combinations
 (“ASC 805”).
The determination was primarily based on Old Nukk’s shareholders prior to the Business Combination having a majority of the voting
interests in the combined company, Old Nukk’s ability to exert control over the majority of the board of directors of the combined
company, and given the board of directors election and retention provisions, Old Nukk’s ability to maintain control of the board
of directors on a go-forward basis, Old Nukk’s senior management comprising the senior management of the combined company; and old
Nukk’s operations prior to the Business Combination comprise the ongoing operations of the combined company. Accordingly, for accounting
purposes, the Business Combination was treated as the equivalent of Old Nukk issuing stock for the net assets of Brilliant, accompanied
by a recapitalization. The net assets of Brilliant were stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded.

While Brilliant was the legal acquirer in the
Business Combination, because Old Nukk was deemed the accounting acquirer, the historical financial statements of Old Nukk became the
historical financial statements of the combined company, upon consummation of the Business Combination. As a result, the financial statements
included in this report reflect (i) the historical operating results of Old Nukk prior to the Business Combination; (ii) the combined
results of Brilliant and Old Nukk following the closing of the Business Combination; (iii) the assets and liabilities of Old Nukk at their
historical cost; and (iv) the Company’s equity structure for all periods presented.

Effective October 24, 2024, the Company amended its amended and restated
certificate of incorporation to implement a one-for-eight reverse stock split of its common stock (the “2024 Reverse Stock Split”)
and increased the number of authorized shares of the Company’s common stock from 
40,000,000
 to 
150,000,000
 (see Note 14).

In accordance with guidance applicable to these
circumstances, the equity structure has been restated in all comparative periods to give effect to the number of shares of the Company’s
common stock, $
0.0001
 par value per share, issued to Old Nukk shareholders during the Business Combination and the 2024 Reverse Stock
Split. Accordingly, the disclosure of common shares and per common share data in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and
related notes reflect the Business Combination and 2024 Reverse Stock Split for all periods presented.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Nukkleus Inc, and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon
consolidation. The consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and in accordance with the rules and regulations of the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Any reference in these footnotes to the applicable guidance is meant to refer
to the authoritative U.S. GAAP as found in the ASC and Accounting Standards Updates (“ASU”) of the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”).

Adjustment of prior interim period financial
statements:
 During the preparation of consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended September 30, 2024,
the Company’s management identified that the treatment of losses on extinguishment of obligations owed to affiliates during the
three months ended December 31, 2023 were improperly recognized as a distribution reducing accumulated deficit for transactions where
the obligations were settled through the issuance of shares of the Company’s common stock. The losses on extinguishment of obligations
are to be recognized as capital reductions as the Company is in an accumulated deficit position, and the losses should be treated as
a return of capital given the role of a company’s shareholder.   The correction of the treatment of losses on extinguishment
of obligations owed to affiliates did not have an impact on the Company’s financial position for the three months ended December
31, 2023.

NOTE 2 – 
Liquidity
and capital resources

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared
on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business.
On December 22, 2023, the Company consummated the Business Combination and raised net proceeds of $
150,161
 net of transaction costs and
expenses. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash of approximately $
3,700
, exclusive of customer custodial funds. The Company had
a working capital deficit of approximately $
6,104,000
 at September 30, 2024 and incurred a net loss and generated negative cash flow from
operating activities of approximately $
8,519,000
 and $
3,818,000
, respectively, for the year ended September 30, 2024. These
are indicators of substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from issuance
of these financial statements. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the management of expenses
and ability to obtain necessary financing to meet its obligations and pay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when
they come due, and upon profitable operations.

If additional equity or debt financing is required
from outside sources, the Company may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to it or at all. If the Company is unable to raise additional
capital on acceptable terms when needed, its results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.
Any such financing likely would be dilutive to existing stockholders and could result in significant financial operating covenants that
would negatively impact the Company business. On December 20, 2024, the Company closed a $
10.0
 million private placement whereby it received
$
10.0
 million in cash from the sale of shares of the Company’s common stock and stock purchase warrants (see Note 20).

Based on the foregoing, management believes that
its current financial resources, as of the date of the issuance of these financial statements, are sufficient to fund its current twelve-month
operating budget, alleviating any concerns by its historical operating results and satisfying its estimated liquidity needs for the twelve
months from the issuance of these financial statements.

NOTE 3 – 
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Emerging growth company
: 
The Company
is an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (“JOBS”) Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging
growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act, until such
time as to those standards apply to private companies. The Company has elected to use this extended transition period for complying with
new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date
that it (i) is no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opts out of the extended transition
period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, these financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with the new or
revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.

Use of estimates: 
The preparation
of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Making estimates requires management to exercise significant
judgment. Such estimates may be subject to change as more current information becomes available and accordingly the actual results could
differ significantly from those estimates. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation
or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate,
could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly
from those estimates. The Company’s most significant estimates and judgments involve valuation of share-based compensation, valuation
of equity-classified stock purchase warrants, valuation of customer digital currency assets and liabilities, classification of gains and
losses on settlement of related party liabilities, calculation for allowances for credit losses, the useful lives of long-lived assets,
assumptions used in assessing impairment of long-lived assets, and valuation of deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowances.

Segment reporting: 
ASC 280, 
Segment
Reporting 
(“ASC 280”), defines operating segments as components of an enterprise where discrete financial information
is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision-maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources
and in assessing performance. The Company’s CODM is the chief executive officer, who has ultimate responsibility for the operating
performance of the Company and the allocation of resources. The CODM uses operating results as the primary measure to manage the business.
The Company determined there are 
two
 operating and reportable segment based on the level at which the CODM reviews operating results,
assesses performance and makes decisions regarding resource allocation. The general support services segment provides general support
services to customers, including operational reporting and technical support infrastructure, website hosting and marketing solutions,
accounting maintenance, risk monitoring services, new account processing and customer care and continued support and the financial services
segment provides payment processing services to customers who submit requests to process a payment to a third party, often involving exchanging
one fiat currency to another or to a digital asset as part of the transaction.

Cash and cash equivalents: 
The Company
considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity date of three months or less at the time of purchase and money market accounts
to be cash equivalents. The Company had 
no
 cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 and 2023. Cash and cash equivalents excludes customer
legal tender, which is reported separately as customer custodial funds in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
At September 30,
2024 and 2023, the Company’s cash balances by geographic area were as follows:

Customer custodial funds and customer custodial
cash liabilities: 
Customer custodial funds represent restricted cash and cash equivalents maintained in segregated Company
1

bank accounts that are held for the exclusive benefit of customers and deposits in transit from financial institutions. Customer custodial
cash liabilities represent the obligation to return cash deposits held by customers in the fiat wallets and unsettled fiat deposits and
withdrawals. Deposits in transit represent settlements from third-party payment processors and banks for customer transactions. Deposits
in transit are typically received within five business days of the transaction date. The Company establishes withdrawal-based limits in
order to mitigate potential losses by preventing customers from withdrawing the digital asset to an external blockchain address until
the deposit settles. Deposits in transit qualify as eligible liquid assets to meet regulatory requirements to fulfill the Company’s
direct obligations under customer custodial cash liabilities. The Company restricts the use of the assets underlying the customer custodial
funds to meet regulatory requirements and classifies the assets as current based on their purpose and availability to fulfill the Company’s
direct obligations under custodial cash liabilities. 

In accordance with regulations in the United Kingdom,
and the terms of the principal license holder the Company operates under, the Company is able to extend credit to its customers. At the
time the Company’s management designates customer custodial funds held in its United Kingdom bank account to be used to extend credit,
the designated amount is re-classified as cash and cash equivalents and no longer classified as customer custodial funds on the Company’s
consolidated balance sheets. The remaining assets underlying the customer custodial funds remain separately classified as such on the
Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The Company identifies these customer custodial funds separately from corporate funds and
maintain them in separate and non-interest bearing accounts.

Customer digital currency assets and liabilities:

At certain times, customers’ funds that are used to make payments on behalf of the customers, remain in the form of digital
assets in the customers’ wallets at the digital asset trading platforms while the digital asset awaits final conversion and/or transfer
to the customer’s payment final destination. These indirectly held digital assets, may consist of USDT (Stablecoin), Bitcoin, and
Ethereum (collectively, “Customer digital currency assets”).

The Company safeguards customer digital currency
assets for customers in digital wallets and portions of cryptographic keys necessary to access digital assets on The Company’s platform.
The Company safeguards these assets and/or keys and is obligated to safeguard them from loss, theft, or other misuse. The Company records
customer digital currency assets and liabilities, in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, “
Views of the staff regarding
the accounting for obligations to safeguard crypto-assets an entity holds for platform users” 
(“SAB 121”). The Company
maintains a record of all digital assets in digital wallets held on the Company’s platform as well as the full or a portion of private
keys including backup keys, which are maintained on behalf of customers. For digital assets where the customer can transact without the
involvement of the Company or digital assets where the Company does not maintain a private key or the ability to recover a customer’s
private key or their digital assets, these balances are not recorded, as there is no related safeguarding obligation in accordance with
SAB 121. The Company records the customer digital currency assets and liabilities, on the initial recognition and at each reporting date,
at the fair value of the digital assets which it safeguards for its customers.

The Company is committed to securely storing all customer digital assets
and cryptographic keys (or portions thereof) held on behalf of customers. The value of these safeguarded assets is recorded as customer
digital currency liabilities and corresponding customer digital currency assets. As such, the Company may be liable to its customers for
losses arising from theft or loss of private keys. The Company has no reason to believe it will incur any expense associated with such
potential liability because (i) it has no known or historical experience of claims to use as a basis of measurement, (ii) it accounts
for and continually verifies the amount of digital assets on its platform, and (iii) it has established security around private key management
to minimize the risk of theft or loss. The Company has adopted a number of measures to safeguard digital assets it secures including,
but not limited to, holding customer digital assets on a 1:1 basis and strategically storing custodied assets offline using the Company’s
cold storage process. The Company also does not reuse or rehypothecate customer digital assets nor grant security interests in customer
digital assets, in each case unless required by law or expressly agreed to by the institutional customer. Any loss or theft would impact
the measurement of the customer digital assets.

The Company classifies the customer digital currency
assets and liabilities as current based on their purpose and availability to fulfill its direct obligations to its customers.

Fair value measurements:
 ASC 820,

Fair Value Measurements
 (“ASC 820”), clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would
be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value
is a market-based measurement that should be determined based upon assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset
or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, ASC 820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the
inputs used in measuring fair value as follows

●
Level 1 – Inputs based on unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company
has the ability to access at the measurement date.

●
Level 2 – Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices
for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active
or for which all significant inputs are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.

●
Level 3 – Inputs reflect management’s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability
at the measurement date. The inputs are both unobservable for the asset and liability in the market and significant to the overall fair
value measurement.

An asset’s or liability’s fair value
measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
Valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value
are based on one or more of the following techniques noted in ASC 820:

●
Market approach:
 Prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving
identical or comparable assets or liabilities.

●
Cost approach: 
Amount that would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset (replacement
cost).

●
Income approach:
 Techniques to convert future amounts to a single present value amount based upon
market expectations (including present value techniques, option pricing, and excess earnings models).

The Company believes its valuation methods are
appropriate and consistent with other market participants, however the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the
fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

The Company’s financial instruments with
a carrying value that approximates fair value consist of cash, customer custodial funds, due from affiliates, notes receivable –
related parties, net, other current assets, accounts payable, customer custodial cash liabilities, due to affiliates, accrued expenses
and other current liabilities, interest payable – related parties, and short-term borrowings due to their liquid or short-term nature
or expected settlement dates of these instruments. If these financial instruments were recorded at fair value, they would be based on
Level 1 inputs, except for short-term borrowings and notes receivable, related parties, net which would be based on Level 2 and Level
3 inputs, respectively.

F-
11

The Company’s non-financial assets, such
as intangible assets, and financial assets are adjusted to fair value when an impairment charge is recognized. The impairment charge recognized
on non-financial assets that consist of acquired intangible assets is based on Level 3 inputs, including a comparison of the Company’s
results with expectations and expectation for future profits. The impairment charge recognized of non-financial assets that consist of
digital assets is based on Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, determined whether there is an active market for the digital asset at period end.
The impairment charge recognized for financial assets that consist of investment in privately held equity securities is based on Level
3 inputs, including the global economic environment, adjustments for investment-specific developments and the rights and obligations of
the securities the Company holds.

The Company’s financial instruments that
are measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of the customer digital currency assets and liabilities (see Note 13).

Related parties: 
The Company considers
parties to be related if one party has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or exercise significant influence
over the other party in making financial and operating decisions. Parties are also considered to be related if they are subject to common
control or significant influence of the same party, such as a family member or relative, shareholder, or a related corporation. The Company
reviews the relationships of its vendors, customers, shareholders, and board members to determine whether there are any parties meet the
criteria to be considered related. Any party that is deemed to be related to the Company is referred to as an “affiliate”
or “related party” in these consolidated financial statements.

Due from affiliates and notes receivable
– related parties, net:
 Due from affiliates and notes receivable – related parties, net are contractual rights to
receive cash on demand or on fixed or determinable dates and are recognized as an asset on the consolidated balance sheets. Due from affiliates
consist of amounts owed from affiliates of the Company for either services provided to the affiliate or expenses paid by the Company on
behalf of the affiliate (see Note 17). Notes receivable – related parties, net consist of advances made to affiliates in exchange
for a promissory note from the affiliate (see Note 17).

Other current assets:
 Other current
assets primarily consists of escrow cash, security deposit, accounts receivable, interest receivable, other receivables and prepaid miscellaneous
items. The Company expects all current assets to be collected and/or realized within the next 12 months.

Allowance for credit losses
: The
Company recognizes an allowance for credit losses based on expected credit losses on receivables in an amount equal to the estimated probable
losses net of recoveries. The Company currently monitors financial conditions of the companies it has receivables from on a continuing
basis. After considering current economic conditions and specific and financial stability of its receivables, an allowance for credit
losses is maintained in the balance sheet at a level which management believes is sufficient to cover all probable future credit losses
as of the balance sheet date based on specific reserves and an expectation of future economic conditions that might impact collectability.
The Company’s policy is to write off past-due accrued interest receivable in a timely manner, and as such, the Company elected not
to measure an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivable on notes receivables outstanding. Other receivables,
due from affiliates and notes receivable – related parties, net are carried at amortized cost, net of allowances for credit losses.
Amortized cost approximated book value as of September 30, 2024. After all reasonable attempts to collect a receivable have failed, the
amount of the receivable is written off against the allowance. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the allowance for credit losses was
$
0
 and $
637,072
 respectively.

Customer, Supplier, and Concentration Risk: 

Cash: 
The Company’s cash and cash
equivalents and customer custodial funds are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Cash and cash equivalents and customer
custodial funds are primarily placed with financial institutions which are of high credit quality. The Company invests cash and cash equivalents
and customer custodial funds primarily in highly liquid, highly rated instruments which are uninsured. The Company may also have corporate
deposit balances with financial institutions which exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limit of $
250,000
. The Company
has not experienced losses on these accounts and does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk with respect to these accounts.
The Company also holds cash and digital assets at digital asset trading venues and performs a regular assessment of these venues as part
of its risk management process. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any risks
on its cash in bank accounts. At September 30, 2024, the Company’s customer custodial funds balance was not in excess of the federally-insured
limits.

Customers:
 The Company performs ongoing
credit evaluations of its customers to reduce credit risk, but determined risks associated with non-payment from its customers is limited
due to short-term payment terms. One customer, who is also an affiliate of the Company, accounted for 
35.7
% and 
96.2
% of the Company’s
total due from affiliates at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 
81.2
% and 
90.2
% of the Company’s total revenues for
the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Two customers and one officer also accounted for 
17.1
%, 
17.6
% and 
29.6
% of
the Company’s total due from affiliates at September 30, 2024.

Suppliers:
 One supplier, who is an affiliate of the Company,
accounted for 
94.6
% and 
86.8
% of the Company’s total cost of revenues for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Reliance on a single supplier may negatively affect the Company’s ability to operate if the supplier’s services vary in reliability
or quality, potentially harming results of operations.

F-
12

Investments: 
The Company holds equity
investments in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values. The Company makes a determination upon entering into
an arrangement whether an entity in which an investment is made is considered a variable interest entity (“VIE”).
The investments in privately held companies are re-evaluated on an ongoing basis. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were no VIEs
required to be consolidated in our consolidated financial statements because the Company does not have a controlling financial interest
in any of the VIEs in which it has invested nor is the Company the primary beneficiary. These investments are accounted for under either
the equity method or as equity investments without readily determinable fair value, depending on the circumstances.

Investments where the Company (1) holds less than

20
% ownership in the entity, and (2) does not exercise significant influence are recorded at cost and adjusted for observable transactions
for same or similar investments of the same issuer (referred to as the measurement alternative) or impairment (see Note 7). Investments
where the Company (1) holds between 
20
% and 
50
% ownership in the entity, and (2) does not control, but over which it does exert significant
influence are recorded at cost and adjusted for the company’s share of operating results, capital contributions and distributions
(referred to as the equity method).

The Company’s equity method investment is
associated with the acquisition of 
50.0
% of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of a privately held company during March 2022 which
is a company developing a custody and settlement utility operating system. The Company has recognized impairment losses on this equity
method investment in prior years, which reduced the carrying value of the equity method investment to zero.

As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the total carrying
value of investments in privately held companies determined to be VIEs was 
$0
 and $
391,217
, respectively, and the amounts owed to the
Company from the privately held companies was $
0
 and $
95,274
, respectively. The maximum exposure is the sum of the carrying value and
amounts owed to the Company for the respective periods. The investments are classified as long-term investments.

Intangible assets, net: 
Intangible
assets primarily consists of acquired identifiable intangible assets and digital assets. Acquired identifiable intangible assets including
trade names, regulatory licenses, and technology, are being amortized on a straight-line method over an estimated useful life of 
three

to 
five
 years
. Digital assets held by the Company, with no qualifying fair value hedge, are accounted for as intangible assets with indefinite
useful lives, and are initially measured at cost. Digital assets accounted for as intangible assets are subject to impairment losses if
the fair value of the digital assets decreases below the carrying value at any time during the period. The fair value is measured using
the quoted price of the digital asset at the time its fair value is being measured in the Company’s principal market. The Company
assigns costs to digital assets on a first-in, first-out basis.

Impairment of long-lived assets:

In accordance with ASC 360, 
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
 (“ASC 360”), the Company reviews the carrying
values of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets
may not be fully recoverable. Based on the existence of one or more indicators of impairment, the Company measures any impairment of long-lived
assets using the projected discounted cash flow method at the asset group level. The estimation of future cash flows requires significant
management judgment based on the Company’s historical results and anticipated results and is subject to many factors. The discount
rate that is commensurate with the risk inherent in the Company’s business model is determined by its management. An impairment
loss would be recorded if the Company determined that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. The impairment to
be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying values of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets.

The Company assessed its long-lived assets for
any impairment and concluded that there were indicators of impairment on the following long-lived assets:

●

Investment accounted for under the measurement alternative – Impairment indicators were identified at September 30, 2024 and 2023 as a result of the investee’s continued operating results being significantly lower than forecasts, the global economic environment, and progression on meeting operating milestones. The Company calculated its estimated undiscounted cash flows to be less than the carrying amount related to the cost method investment, recognizing impairment losses of $
391,217
 and $
6,210,783
 for the difference for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The impairment loss recorded for the year ended September 30, 2024 reduced the carrying value of the cost method investment to $
0
. 

●

Acquired identifiable intangible assets – Impairment indicators were identified at September 30, 2023 as a result of the Company’s operating results being significantly lower than forecasts. An impairment loss of $
5,695,589
 was recorded for the year ended September 30, 2023. The Company did not record any impairment charge for its acquired identifiable intangible assets for the year ended September 30, 2024 as there was no impairment indicator noted.

●

Digital assets – Impairment indicators were identified at September 30, 2023 as a result of the carrying value of the digital assets exceeding its fair value at period end. An impairment loss of $
7,950
 was recorded for the year ended September 30, 2023. The Company did not record any impairment charge for its digital assets for the year ended September 30, 2024 as there was 
no
 impairment indicator noted.

F-
13

The assumptions used in the impairment analyses
represent Level 3 inputs.

Note payable, loans payable – related
parties, convertible notes payable:
 Debt issuance costs, including original issue discounts, will be recorded to debt discount,
reducing the face amount of the note. Debt issuance costs will be amortized to interest expense over the contractual term of the respective
debt obligation using the effective interest method. If a conversion of the underlying debt occurs, a proportionate share of the unamortized
discount is immediately expensed.

The Company evaluates convertible notes payable
in accordance with ASC 470, “
Debt with Conversion and Other Options
” (“ASC 470”) to determine if embedded
conversion features present in the convertible instrument shall be recognized separately at issuance by allocating a portion of the proceeds
equal to the intrinsic value of that feature to additional paid-in capital. Debt issuance costs are allocated proportionately to the debt
host and conversion feature.

Gains and losses on extinguishment of liabilities:

The Company recognizes gains and losses on extinguishment of liabilities, including accounts payable and debt obligations, with
unrelated parties as the difference between the reacquisition price and the net carrying amount of the associated obligation, as a component
of other expense (income), net in the consolidated statements of operations.

The Company classifies the gains and losses on
extinguishment of liabilities with related partiesthe gain or loss on the extinguishment of each obligation with a related party as a
reduction of capital in the accompanying statements of changes in stockholders’ deficit or as a component of other expense (income),
net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss based on the facts and circumstances of each extinguishment
transaction.

Stock purchase warrants:
 The Company
accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific
terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480, 
Distinguishing liabilities from equity
 (“ASC 480”), and ASC
815, 
Derivatives and Hedging 
(“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial
instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of
the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s own common
shares and whether the warrant holders could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a circumstance outside of the Company’s
control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted
at the time of warrant issuance, modification, and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding.

For issued or modified warrants that meet all
of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the
time of issuance.

For issued or modified warrants that do not meet
all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance,
and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the liability classified warrants are recognized as a non-cash
gain or loss on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

The Company assesses the classification of
its common stock purchase warrants at each reporting date to determine whether a change in classification between equity and
liability is required.

Revenue recognition: 
The Company determines revenue recognition
from contracts with customers through the following steps:

●
Identify the contract, or contracts, with the customer

●
Identify the performance obligations in the contract

●
Determine the transaction price

●
Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations
in the contract

●
Recognize revenue when the company satisfies a performance
obligation

Revenue is recognized when control of the promised
goods or services is transferred to the customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to
in exchange for those goods or services.

General support services:
 General support
services revenue represents support services provided to a customer, including operational reporting and technical support infrastructure,
website hosting and marketing solutions, accounting maintenance, risk monitoring services, new account processing and customer care and
continued support. These services represent multiple performance obligations that are combined into a single unit of accounting. Although
the Company engages a third party to provision the general support services to the customer, the Company is primarily responsible for
fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good or service. That is, the Company is a principal in transactions and presents revenue
on a gross basis.

Judgment is required in determining whether the
Company is the principal or the agent in the provision of general support services as the Company utilizes a third party to perform the
general support services. The Company evaluates the presentation of revenue on a gross or net basis based on whether it is responsible
for fulfilling the promise (gross) or whether the third party performing the services is responsible for fulling the promise to the Company’s
customer (net). The Company is contractually obligated to provide the fulfillment software, technology, customer sales and marketing and
risk management technology hardware and software solutions package to the customer and through a shareholder’s ownership of the
third party contracted to perform the general support services, controls the services of its service provider necessary to legally transfer
of the services to the customer. The Company sets the price of the general support services through an executed contract with the customer.
As a result, the Company acts as the principal by providing the ongoing service support that enables its customers to conduct its business
without interruption.

The Company considers its performance obligation
satisfied and recognizes revenue over time as the general support services are rendered. The Company recognizes the full contracted amount
each period with no deferred revenue. The Company recognizes revenue equal to the rate specified in the contract with the customer over
the term specified in the contract.

Financial services:
 Financial services
revenue represents transaction fees earned from customers which comprise a single performance obligation to provide payment services from
one fiat currency to another or to digital assets as directed by a customer. That is, the Company is an agent in transactions and presents
revenue for the fees earned on a net basis.

Judgment is required in determining whether the
Company is the principal or the agent in financial services transactions. The Company evaluates the presentation of revenue on a gross
or net basis based on whether it controls the asset provided before it is transferred to the customer or the customer’s beneficiary
(gross) or whether it acts as an agent by arranging for other parties to provide the asset to the customer (net). The Company does not
control the fiat currency or digital asset being provided before it is transferred to the customer or customer’s beneficiary, does
not have inventory risk related to the fiat currency or digital asset, and is not responsible for the fulfillment of the fiat currency
or digital asset. The Company also does not set the price for the fiat currency or digital asset as the price is a market rate established
by users of the platform. As a result, the Company acts as an agent in facilitating the ability for a customer to transfer fiat currency
or digital assets to itself or its beneficiary.

The Company considers its performance obligation
satisfied at a point in time and recognizes revenue at the point in time the transaction completes. Contracts with customers are usually
open-ended and can be terminated by either party without a termination penalty. Therefore, contracts are defined at the transaction level
and do not extend beyond the service already provided.

F-
15

The Company charges a fee at the transaction
level. The transaction price, represented by the transaction fee, is calculated based on volume and varies depending on payment type
and the value of the transaction. The transaction fee is collected from the customer at the time the transaction is executed. In certain
instances, the transaction fee can be collected in digital assets, with revenue measured based on the amount of digital assets received
and the fair value of the digital asset at the time of the transaction.  Prepayments, if any, received from customers prior to the
services being performed are recorded as advances from customers. In these cases, when the services are performed, the appropriate portion
of the amount recorded as advance from customers is recognized as revenue. There were 
no
 prepayments recorded at September 30, 2024 and
2023.

The Company has elected to apply the practical
expedient to recognize the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset
that would otherwise have been recognized is 
one year
 or less.

The following table summarizes revenues disaggregated
by geography, based on domicile of the customers, as applicable:

Advertising: 
Costs related to advertising
are expensed as incurred. For the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, advertising costs amounted to $
44,488
 and $
55,889
, respectively,
which was included as a component of operating expenses, on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

Stock-based compensation: 
The Company
measures and recognizes compensation expense for all stock-based awards granted to non-employees, including stock options, based on the
grant date fair value of the award. The Company estimates the grant date fair value of each option award using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model. The model requires management to make a number of assumptions, including the fair value and expected volatility of the Company’s
underlying common stock price, expected live of the option, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield. The fair value of the
underlying stock is the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date that the commitment for performance by the counterparty
has been reached or the counterparty’s performance is complete. The fair value of the equity instrument is calculated and then recognized
as compensation expense over the requisite service period.

The Company has elected to account for forfeitures
of awards as they occur, with previously recognized compensation reversed in the period that the awards are forfeited.

Income taxes: 
The Company accounts for income taxes using
the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial
statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected
to affect taxable income. A valuation allowance is established when management estimates that it is more likely than not that deferred
tax assets will not be realized. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future pre-tax earnings, the reversal of temporary
differences between book and tax income, and the expected rates in future periods.

The Company is required to evaluate the tax positions
taken in the course of preparing its tax returns to determine whether tax positions are more likely than not of being sustained by the
applicable tax authority. Tax benefits of positions not deemed to meet the “more-likely-than-not” threshold would be recorded
as a tax expense in the current year. The amount recognized is subject to estimate and management judgment with respect to the likely
outcome of each uncertain tax position. The amount that is ultimately sustained for an individual uncertain tax position or for all uncertain
tax positions in the aggregate could differ from the amount that is initially recognized. The Company recognizes interest and penalties
related to income tax matters in general and administrative expense.

For U.S. federal tax purposes, digital asset transactions
are treated on the same tax principles as property transactions. The Company recognizes a gain or loss when digital assets are exchanged
for other property, in the amount of the difference between the fair market value of the property received and the tax basis of the exchanged
digital assets. Receipts of digital assets in exchange for goods or services are included in taxable income at the fair market value on
the date of receipt.

Foreign currency translation: 
The
Company’s consolidated financial statements are presented in the reporting currency of the U.S. dollar. Functional currencies
of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries is the local currency used in each entities primary economic environment, some of
which are different than the reporting currency. Assets and liabilities of the Company are translated into the reporting currency
using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet dates. Equity transactions are translated using the historical exchange rate
in effect on the date of the transaction, except for the change in accumulated deficit during the year, which is the results of the
operations translation process. Results of operations and cash flows are translated using the weighted average exchange rates in
effect during the period. As a result, amounts relating to the assets and liabilities reported on the statements of cash flows may
not necessarily agree with the changes in the corresponding balances on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Translation
adjustments resulting from the process of translating the local currency financial statements into the reporting currency are
recorded as a component of comprehensive income (loss). For the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the realized foreign
currency exchange gain (loss) was $
2,225
 and ($
27,470
), respectively, and is included as a component of other (expense) income on
the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. For the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the
unrealized foreign currency exchange gain was $
8,956
 and ($
3,221
), respectively, and is included as a component of other (expense)
income on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

Remeasurement gains and losses from transactions
that are not denominated in the functional currency are recorded as a component of other income in the consolidated statements of operations
and comprehensive loss. Most of the Company’s revenue transactions are transacted in the functional currency of the Company. The
Company does not enter into any material transaction in foreign currencies. Transaction gains or losses have not had, and are not expected
to have, a material effect on the results of operations of the Company.

Comprehensive loss: 
Comprehensive loss is comprised of
net loss and all changes to the statements of equity, except those due to investments by stockholders, changes in paid-in capital and
distributions to stockholders. For the Company, comprehensive loss for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 consisted of net loss
and unrealized loss from foreign currency translation adjustment.

Net loss per share: 
Basic earnings
per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares 
outstanding
during the period, excluding the effects of any potential dilutive securities. Diluted earnings per share is computed similar to basic
earnings per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding
if the potential common share equivalents had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. Earnings per share excludes
all potential dilutive shares of common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive

For the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
potentially dilutive common shares consist of the common shares issuable upon the exercise of common stock options and warrants (using
the treasury stock method) and the conversion of convertible notes payable. In a period in which the Company has a net loss, all potentially
dilutive securities are excluded from the computation of diluted shares outstanding as they would have had an anti-dilutive impact.

The following table summarizes the potentially
dilutive securities excluded from the computation of diluted shares outstanding because the effect of including these potential shares
was anti-dilutive:

Recently issued accounting pronouncements, adopted

Effective October 1, 2023, the Company adopted
the requirements of ASU 2016-13, 
Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (“Topic 326”)
 (“ASU 2016-13”), along
with the subsequently issued guidance amending and clarifying various aspects of ASU 2016-13, using the modified retrospective method
of adoption. In accordance with that method, the comparative periods’ information continues to be reported under the relevant accounting
guidance in effect for that period. For the current period, the standard replaces the existing incurred credit loss model with the current
expected credit losses model for financial instruments, including due from affiliates and notes receivables – related parties, net,
through a cumulative-effect adjustment to accumulated deficit as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance
is effective. Although the adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements it represented
a change in accounting policy with respect to the estimation of uncollectible accounts.

ASU 2023-08, 
Accounting
for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets
 (“ASU 2023-08”), requires entities that hold crypto assets to subsequently measure
such assets at fair value with changes recognized in net income each reporting period. The guidance also requires crypto assets measured
at fair value to be presented separately from other intangible assets on the balance sheet and changes in the fair value measurement of
crypto assets to be presented separately on the income statement from changes in the carrying amounts of other intangible assets. ASU
2023-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2023-08
on October 1, 2024 and will apply the modified retrospective transition approach. While the Company is in the process of finalizing implementation,
based on a preliminary assessment, the Company anticipates a nominal increase in fair value on digital assets held with the corresponding
cumulative-effect adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings.

NOTE 4 – REVERSE RECAPITALIZATION

On December 22, 2023, Old Nukk and Brilliant consummated
the merger contemplated by the Business Combination with Old Nukk surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Brilliant.

Upon the closing of the Business Combination,
Brilliant’s certificate of incorporation was amended and restated to, among other things, set the total number of authorized shares
of capital to 
55,000,000
 shares, of which 
40,000,000
 shares were designated common stock, $
0.0001
 par value per share, and of which 
15,000,000

shares were designated preferred stock, $
0.0001
 par value per share.

Upon the consummation of the Business Combination,
each share of Old Nukk common stock issued and outstanding was cancelled and converted into the right to receive a pro-rata portion of

1,312,494
 shares of the Company’s common stock.

Outstanding stock options, whether vested or unvested,
to purchase shares of Old Nukk common stock (see Note 15) converted into stock options for shares of the Company’s common stock
(each, an “Assumed Option”), upon the same terms and conditions that were in effect with respect to such stock options immediately
prior to the Business Combination, after giving effect to an exchange ratio applicable to the Old Nukk outstanding stock options of 
1:35
.

Outstanding Public Warrants and Private Warrants
(see Note 14) to purchase shares of Brilliant Ordinary Shares remained outstanding at the Closing Date. The warrants became exercisable
30 days after the completion of the Business Combination and will expire 
five years
 after the completion of the Business Combination or
earlier upon redemption or liquidation. Subsequent to the Business Combination, there were 
837,625
 Company warrants outstanding.

A backstop pool was determined to be 
26,668
, 
40
%
of the aggregate number of Brilliant Ordinary shares and Brilliant Rights, in accordance with the terms of the merger agreements (the
“Backstop Pool”) and was issued to certain holders of Brilliant Ordinary Shares, Brilliant Rights, and Brilliant Warrants
as follows:

●

Certain Brilliant shareholders received an additional issuance of shares or warrants as follows:

o

Holders of Brilliant Ordinary Shares received shares of the Company’s common stock equal to their pro rata share of the Backstop Pool

o

Holders of Brilliant Rights received shares of the Company’s common stock equal to their pro-rata share of the Backstop Pool

o

Holders of Brilliant Warrants, other than warrants held by Brilliant’s sponsor or affiliates, received additional Company Warrants that will be exercisable to receive a share of the Company’s common stock plus an additional number of Company warrants equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate number of Brilliant Ordinary Shares and Brilliant Rights outstanding.

In connection with the Business Combination, certain Brilliant shareholders
exercised their right to redeem certain of their outstanding shares for cash, resulting in the redemption of 
41,305
 shares of Brilliant
Class A Ordinary Shares at approximately $
92.56
 per share, for gross redemption payments of $
3,822,431
. Additionally, a balance owed to
the sponsor of Brilliant totaling $
3,881,627
 was settled through the issuance of 
12,935
 shares of the Company’s common stock.

F-
19

The Business Combination is accounted for as a
reverse recapitalization in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Under this method of accounting, Brilliant was treated as the “acquired”
company for financial reporting purposes. See Note 1 “Description of business and basis of presentation” for further details.
Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Business Combination was treated as the equivalent of Old Nukk issuing stock for the net assets
of Brilliant, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of Brilliant are stated as historical cost, with no goodwill or intangible
assets recorded.

Prior to the Business Combination, Old Nukk and
Brilliant filed separate standalone federal, state and local income tax returns. As a result of the Business Combination, Old Nukk will
file a consolidated income tax return. Although, for legal purposes, Brilliant acquired Old Nukk, and the transaction represents a reverse
acquisition for federal income tax purposes. Brilliant will be the parent of the consolidated group, with Old Nukk a subsidiary, but in
the year of the closing of the Business Combination, Old Nukk will file a full year tax return with Brilliant joining in the return the
day after the Closing Date.

the Business Combination to the consolidated statements of cash flows and the consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’

and outstanding share of common stock without any action on the part of stockholders. No fractional shares of common stock were issued
to any stockholders in connection with the 2024 Reverse Stock Split. Each stockholder was entitled to receive one share of common stock
in lieu of the fractional share that would have resulted from the 2024 Reverse Stock Split. The number of the Company’s authorized
common stock remain unchanged, and the par value of the common stock following the 2024 Reverse Stock Split remained at $

Warrants:

Public Warrants:

On June 26, 2020, Brilliant completed an initial public offering that included warrants for shares of common stock (the “Public
Warrants’). Each Public Warrant entitles the holder the right to purchase 
one
 share of common stock at an exercise price of $
11.50

per share. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the Public Warrants. The Company may elect to redeem the Public Warrants,
in whole and not in part, at a price of $
0.01
 per Public Warrant if (i) 
30
 days’ prior written notice of redemption is provided
to the holders, and (ii) the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock equals or exceeds $
16.50
 per share (as adjusted
for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period
ending on the third business day prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. Upon issuance
of a redemption notice by the Company, the warrant holders have a period of 
30
 days to exercise for cash, or on a cashless basis. On
the Closing Date, there were 
805,000
 Public Warrants issued and outstanding.

Private Warrants:

Simultaneous with Brilliant’s initial public offering in June 2020, Brilliant sold warrants to its sponsor and certain of its
directors and advisors in a private placement (the “Private Warrants”). The Private Warrants may not be redeemed by the Company
so long as the Private Warrants are held by the initial purchasers, or such purchasers’ permitted transferees. The Private Warrants
have terms and provisions identical to the Public Warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period, except
if the Private Warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers’ permitted transferees, then the Private Warrants
are redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants. On the Closing Date, there were

32,625
 Private Warrants issued and outstanding.

As a result of
the Business Combination which was completed on December 22, 2023, Public Warrants and Private Warrants totaling 
837,625
 were converted
into 
837,625
 warrants of the Company.

Stock Purchase Warrants:
 In connection
with certain note payable agreements (see Note 11) and certain convertible notes payable (see Note 12), the Company issued stock purchase
warrants to certain lenders that permit the lender to acquire a fixed amount of shares of the Company’s common stock at a per share
price that ranges between $
0.25
 and $
0.3125
 for a term that ranges between three and five years that may be exercised on a cash or cashless
basis.

NOTE 15 – STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

Old Nukk Equity Incentive Plan

For periods prior to the reverse recapitalization
(see Note 4), the Old Nukk Equity Incentive Plan (the “Old Nukk Plan”) permitted the granting of various awards including
stock options (including both nonqualified options and incentive options), stock appreciate rights (“SARs”), stock awards,
phantom stock units, performance awards and other share-based awards to employees, outside directors and consultants, and advisors to
the Company. Only stock options have been awarded to consultants and advisors under the Old Nukk Plan.

Assumed Options
converted into an option to purchase a number of shares of the Company’s common stock equal to the product of the number of shares
of Old Nukk common stock and the Exchange Ratio at an exercise price per share equal to the exercise price of the Assumed Options divided
by the Exchange Ratio. Each Assumed Option is governed by the same terms and conditions applicable to the Assumed Options prior to the
Business Combination. No further grants can be made under the Old Nukk Plan.

Stock options generally
vest over one to three years, with a maximum term of ten years from the date of grant. These awards become available to the recipient
upon the satisfaction a vesting condition based on a period of service.

The Company
provided a valuation allowance equal to the deferred income tax assets for years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 because it is not
presently known whether future taxable income will be sufficient to utilize the loss carry-forwards. The valuation allowance could be
reduced or eliminated based on future earnings and future estimates of taxable income. At each reporting date, management considers new
evidence, both positive and negative, that could affect its view of the future realization of deferred tax assets. On the basis of this
evaluation, only the portion of the deferred tax asset that is more likely than not to be realized was recognized. However, if the Company
is not able to generate sufficient taxable income from its operations in the future, then a valuation allowance to reduce the Company’s
U.S. deferred tax assets may be required, which would increase the Company’s expenses in the period the allowance is recognized.

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had $
8,439,349

in U.S. federal net operating loss carry-forwards that can be utilized in future periods to reduce taxable income. However, due to changes
in stock ownership, the use of the U.S. federal net operating loss carry-forwards is limited under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue
Code. The Company has not performed a study to determine if the loss carryforwards are subject to these Section 382 limitations. $
258,405

of the net operating loss carry-forwards will expire in fiscal years 2033 through 2038. The remaining net operating loss carry-forwards
do not expire. In addition, the Company has net operating losses in Malta and United Kingdom totaling $
447,770
 and $
1,890,545
, respectively,
with no expiration date.

As of September
30, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not identify any uncertain tax positions that would require either recognition or disclosure in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions
in income tax expense. There was no interest or penalties recorded for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

The Company has
a December 31 tax year-end. The federal, state and foreign income tax returns of the Company are subject to examination by various tax
authorities, generally for three years after they are filed. The Company is not subject to income taxes in Bermuda. The Company’s
2021 through 2024 tax years are subject to examination.

transactional financial advisor and finder with respect to the Business Combination. The letter agreement of the TA Firm was terminated
effective October 2023 and the board member resigned effective October 2023. The Company incurred advisory fees totaling $

At September 30,
2023, the balance of $
229,837
 owed from one affiliate where a shareholder has a controlling interest in the affiliate, represented advances
made to the affiliate and monies that the Company paid on behalf of the affiliate, were written off after exhaustive efforts at collection.

Loans payable – related parties: 
The Company has entered
into several promissory notes with shareholders and affiliates during the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (see Note 10).

Notes receivable – related
parties

Shareholder note receivable
:
The Company originated a note receivable to a shareholder in the principal amount of $
35,000
 on September 1, 2022. The note bears a fixed
interest rate of 
5.0
% per annum with $
17,500
 maturing on 
March 1, 2023
 and $
17,500
 maturing on 
September 1, 2023
. The principal was funded
with cash custodial money. In April 2024, the outstanding balance under the note and accrued and unpaid interest totaling $
37,198
 and$
3,007
,
respectively was exchanged for loan payable – related parties (see Note 10). 

Brilliant note receivable:
 During
the year ended September 30, 2023, the Company made non-interest bearings loans with an aggregate principal of $
299,650
 to Brilliant.
The principal was payable promptly after the date on which Brilliant consummated an initial business combination with a target business.
These loans were not convertible into any securities of Brilliant. At September 30, 2023, the amount of $
299,650
 was written off after
exhaustive efforts at collection. 

Line
of credit:
  On July 31, 2023, the Company entered into a credit deed providing a $
1,000,000
 line of credit (the “Line
of Credit”) to an affiliate a shareholder’s sibling controls. The Line of Credit allows the borrower to request loans thereunder
until total advances reach $
1.0
 million. Amounts drawn under the Line of Credit bear interest at an annual rate of 
8.0
% and installment
repayments commence on December 31, 2023. The Line of Credit was collateralized by 
133,514
 shares of the Company’s common stock
that are owned by the borrower.

During the year ended September 30,
2023, $
764,892
 was advanced to the borrower under the Line of Credit. At September 30, 2023, the Company recorded a reserve for credit
loss of $
637,072
 on the Line of Credit. During December 2023, the Company and the related party company entered into a Stock Transfer
Agreement pursuant to which the collateral, 133,514 shares of the Company’s common stock owed by the related party, were to be
transferred to the Company to satisfy the amount owed under the Line of Credit. As of September 30, 2024, the transfer of the 
133,514

shares of the Company’s common stock back to the Company had not occurred and management deemed it remote that the transfer will
occur. During the year ended September 30, 2024, the Company collected $
132,826
. At September 30, 2024, after exhaustive efforts at collection
of the outstanding amounts owed under the Line of Credit and unsuccessful attempts to collect the collateral, the Company wrote off the
remaining outstanding balance of the Line of Credit against the reserve for credit loss.

For
the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the interest income related to notes receivable – related parties amounted to
$
949
 and $
12,082
, respectively, and has been included as a component of other income (expense), net on the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

As of September 30, 2024 and 2023,
the outstanding interest receivable related to the notes receivable – related parties was $
0
 and $
12,179
, respectively, and was
included as a component of other current assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Management determined
the due from affiliates and notes receivables – related party to be fully collectable. Therefore, no reserve for credit losses
is deemed to be required on notes receivable – related party or due from affiliates at September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2023.
The Company recorded a reserve for credit loss of $
10,199
 for the accrued and unpaid interest associated with the notes receivable –
related parties. During the year ended September 30, 2024, the Company wrote off the outstanding balance of the accrued and unpaid interest
against the reserve for credit loss.

assets and liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

NOTE 18 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Indemnifications:

The Company has indemnity agreements with certain officers and directors of the Company pursuant
to which the Company must indemnify the officer or director against all expenses, judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement reasonably
incurred in connection with a third party proceeding, if the indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be
in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and in the case of a criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe
the indemnitee’s conduct was unlawful. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential exposure under these indemnification
agreements: (i) because the facts and circumstances involved in each claim are unique and the Company cannot predict the number or nature
of claims that may be made; (ii) due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement; and (iii) due to the
requirement for a registration of the Company’s securities before any of the indemnification obligations contemplated in the IRA
become effective.

F-
35

Legal
and regulatory proceedings:
 The Company is subject to various litigation, regulatory investigations, and other legal proceedings
that arise in the ordinary course of its business. The Company is also subject to regulatory oversight by numerous regulatory and other
governmental agencies. The Company reviews its lawsuits, regulatory investigations, and other legal proceedings on an ongoing basis and
provides disclosure and records loss contingencies in accordance with the loss contingencies accounting guidance. In accordance with
such guidance, the Company establishes accruals for such matters when potential losses become probable and can be reasonably estimated.
If the Company determines that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, the Company discloses the
possible loss in the consolidated financial statements.

There is a deficit between customer assets
and liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. We are subject to regulatory and legal review in the jurisdictions
we operate in. There are currently no claims against the Company. Any claims or regulatory actions against us, whether meritorious
or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, settlement payments, damage awards (including statutory damages for
certain causes of action in certain jurisdictions), fines, penalties, injunctive relief, or increased costs of doing business
through adverse judgment or settlement, require us to change our products, services or business practices in expensive ways, require
significant amounts of management time, result in the diversion of significant operations resources, or otherwise harm our
business.

Tax regulation:

Current promulgated tax rules related to digital assets are unclear and require significant
judgments to be made in interpretation of the law, including but not limited to the areas of income tax, information reporting, transaction
level taxes and the withholding of tax at source. 
Additional legislation or guidance may be issued by U.S. and non-U.S. governing
bodies that may differ significantly from the Company’s practices or interpretation of the law, which could have unforeseen effects on
the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, and accordingly, the related impact on the Company’s financial
condition and results of operations is not estimable.

Digital asset wallets:
 The Company has
committed to safeguard all digital assets and digital token identifiers on behalf of its customers. As such, the company may be liable
to its customers for losses arising from theft or loss of customer private keys. The Company has no reason to believe it will incur any
expense associated with such potential liability because (i) it has no known or historical experience of claims to use as a basis of measurement,
(ii) it accounts for and continually verifies the amount of digital assets within its control, and (iii) it engages third parties, which
are digital asset trading platforms, to provide certain custodial services, including holding its customers’ digital token identifiers,
securing its customers’ digital assets, and protecting them from loss or theft, including indemnification against certain types
of losses such as theft. Its third-party digital asset trading platforms hold the digital assets in accounts in the Company’s name
for the benefit of the Company’s customers.

White lion stock purchase agreement: 
On
May 17, 2022, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “White Lion Agreement”) with White Lion Capital Partners,

but not the obligation, to require White Lion to purchase shares of its common stock up to a maximum amount of $
75,000,000
. In January
2024, the Company issued 
202,702
 shares of the Company’s common stock with a fair value of $
750,000
 to settle its obligation owed
under the White Lion Agreement (see Note 14). On February 21, 2024, the Company terminated the White Lion Agreement.

On December 19, 2024, the Company and the Investor

Securities Purchase Agreement: 
On
December 15, 2024, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement and Call Option (the “Star Agreement”) with Star
26 Capital Inc. (“Star”), the shareholders of Star (“Star Equity Holders”) and an officer of the Company acting
in his capacity as the representative of the Star Equity Holders, to acquire a controlling

The Star Equity Holders granted the Company an
option (the “Option”) to purchase the balance of their equity in Star (
49.0
%) for an aggregate $
16,084,250
 (the “Option
Exercise Price”) in consideration for the issuance to the Star Equity Holders five-year stock purchase warrants to purchase an

Nasdaq, Star shall have the right, at its own discretion, to require the Company to exchange the Investment Note for all the shares of
Star then held by the Company, provided, however, the Option shall be automatically cancelled and Star shall retain any cash payments
made by the Company to Star and the Company shall retain an equity interest in Star equivalent to all cash payments. The closing of the
Transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, third-party consents, fairness opinion, and approval
by the Company’s shareholders as required under applicable Nasdaq listing rules.

If the Star Agreement is canceled because stockholder
approval was not obtained within 90-days after the date of the Star Agreement and the failure was a result of the Company failing to perform
or observe the covenants or agreements of the Company provided for in the terms of the Star Agreement, the Seller is entitled to damages
of $
1,000,000
 from the Company.

As a result of the Settlement Agreement and subject
to the closing of the acquisition of Star, the Company’s business will be focused on the defense sector.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with
Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.

On May 22, 2023, the Board
of Directors (the “Board”) of the Company approved the engagement of Gries and Associates, LLC (“Gries”) as the
Company’s new independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2023. The change was effective
upon execution of an engagement letter. In connection with the selection of Gries, the Board dismissed Marcum LLP (“Marcum”)
as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm on May 22, 2023.

On November 3, 2023, the Company
was informed that Gries had sold its business to GreenGrowth CPAs (“GreenGrowth”).

On November 5, 2023, the Company
engaged and executed an agreement with GreenGrowth as the Company’s new independent accountant to replace Gries. As Gries was engaged
by the Company on May 22, 2023, Gries has not issued a report on the Company’s financial statements. The Board of the Company, acting
as the audit committee, approved the decision to change independent accountants.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

In connection with the preparation
of this Report, our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of the
end of the period covered by this report (under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”)).
Based on that assessment, our CEO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)
under the Exchange Act) were effective.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting

Our internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our CEO and effected by our Board, management and other personnel,
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes policies
and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of our assets; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in
accordance with the authorization of our Board and management; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection
of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.

Under the supervision and
participation of our management, including our CEO, we evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based
on the framework set forth in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 issued in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission. As part of our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September
30, 2024, management has performed adequate testing to conclude that the material weakness identified in the prior fiscal year has not
been remediated as of September 30, 2024 related to the Company possessing sufficient resources to properly identify and account
for the evaluation of intangible assets and its cost-method investments and to implement and sustain appropriate entity-level controls.

61

Plan
of Remediation of Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Following the identification
and communication of the material weakness described above, management commenced remediation actions relating to this material weakness
beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, as follows:

●
We are utilizing the services of external consultants for
non-routine and\or technical accounting issues as they arise.

●
We are expanding and improving our review process for complex
accounting transactions. We plan to further improve this process by enhancing access to accounting literature, identification of third-party
professionals with whom to consult regarding complex accounting applications and consideration of additional staff with the requisite
experience and training to supplement existing accounting professionals.

●
We are implementing enhancements and process improvements,
including the design and implementation of well-defined controls and related control attributes

The material weaknesses identified
above will not be considered fully remediated until these additional controls and procedures have operated effectively for a
sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are effective. Our management will monitor
the effectiveness of our remediation plans and will make changes management determines to be appropriate. If not remediated, these
material weaknesses could result in material misstatements to our annual or interim consolidated financial statements that may not be
prevented or detected on a timely basis or result in a delayed filing of required periodic reports. If we are unable to assert that our
internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial
reports, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected, and we could become subject to litigation or investigations
by Nasdaq, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.

This Annual Report on Form
10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting. Pursuant to Item 308(b) of Regulation S-K, management’s report is not subject to attestation by our independent
registered public accounting firm because the Company is neither an “accelerated filer” nor a “large accelerated filer”
as those terms are defined by the SEC.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our
internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting, except as described above.

Inherent Limitation on the Effectiveness of Internal Control

The effectiveness of any system of internal control
over financial reporting, including ours, is subject to inherent limitations, including the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing,
operating, and evaluating the controls and procedures, and the inability to eliminate misconduct completely. Accordingly, any system
of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable,
not absolute assurances. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
We intend to continue to monitor and upgrade our internal controls as necessary or appropriate for our business but cannot assure you
that such improvements will be sufficient to provide us with effective internal control over financial reporting.

Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm

This Annual Report on Form
10-K does not include an attestation report by our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting. As a smaller reporting company, our internal control over financial reporting was not subject to audit by our independent registered
public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management’s report.

Board of Directors

Directors on our Board of
Directors are elected for one-year terms and serve until the next annual security holders’ meeting or until their death, resignation,
retirement, removal, disqualification, or until a successor has been elected and qualified. All officers are appointed annually by the
Board of Directors and serve at the discretion of the Board. Currently, each director receives annual compensation of $20,000 for their
services on our Board.

We reimburse our directors
for expenses incurred in connection with attending directors’ meetings. We will consider applying for officers and directors’
liability insurance at such time when we have the resources to do so.

Director Independence

Nasdaq listing rules require that a majority of
the board of directors of a company listed on Nasdaq be composed of “independent directors,” which is defined generally as
a person other than an officer or employee of the Company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship, which, in
the opinion of the Company’s board of directors, would interfere with the director’s exercise of independent judgment in carrying
out the responsibilities of a director. Our board of directors has determined that each of David Rokach, Tomer Nagar, Aviya Volodarsky
and Reuven Yeganeh be an independent director under the Nasdaq listing rules and Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act. In making these determinations,
the board of directors considered the current and prior relationships that each non-employee director has with Nukkleus and will have
with the combined company and all other facts and circumstances our board of directors deemed relevant in determining independence, including
the beneficial ownership of our Common Stock by each non-employee director, and the transactions involving them described in the section
entitled “
Certain Relationships and Related Transactions
.”

Committees of the Board of Directors

The standing committees of
our board of directors consist of an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee, and a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Below

in March 2024.

For the years ended September

on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Line of credit

On July 31, 2023, the Company entered
into a credit deed providing a $1,000,000 line of credit (the “Line of Credit”) to an affiliate a shareholder’s sibling
controls. The Line of Credit allows the borrower to request loans thereunder until total advances reach $1.0 million. Amounts drawn under
the Line of Credit bear interest at an annual rate of 8.0% and installment repayments commence on December 31, 2023. The Line of Credit
was collateralized by 133,514 shares of the Company’s common stock that are owned by the borrower.

During the year ended September 30,
2023, $764,892 was advanced to the borrower under the Line of Credit. At September 30, 2023, the Company recorded a reserve for credit
loss of $637,072 on the Line of Credit. During December 2023, the Company and the related party company entered into a Stock Transfer

Director Independence

Our board of directors currently
consists of six members. Our board of directors has determined that David Rokach, Tomer Nagar, Aviya Volodarsky and Reuven Yeganeh qualify
as independent directors in accordance with the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) listing requirements. Mr. Menachem Shalom
and Ms. Anastasiia Kotaieva are not considered independent. Nasdaq’s independence definition includes a series of objective tests,
such as that the director is not, and has not been for at least three (3) years, one of our employees and that neither the director nor
any of his or her family members has engaged in various types of business dealings with us. In addition, as required by Nasdaq rules,
our board of directors has made a subjective determination as to each independent director that no relationships exist that, in the opinion
of our board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.
In making these determinations, our board of directors reviewed and discussed information provided by the directors and us with regard
to each director’s business and personal activities and relationships as they may relate to us and our management. There are no
family relationships among any of our directors or executive officers.

Item 14. Principal Accounting Fees and Services.

Our audit committee pre-approves
all services, including both audit and non-audit services, provided by our independent accountants. For audit services, each year the
independent auditor provides our board of directors with an engagement letter outlining the scope of the audit services proposed to be
performed during the year, which must be formally accepted by the board of directors before the audit commences.

The independent auditor also
submits an audit services fee proposal, which also must be approved by the board of directors before the audit commences.

On May 22, 2023, the Board
of Directors of Old Nukk approved the engagement of Gries and Associates, LLC (“Gries”) as Old Nukk’s independent registered
public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2023. The change was effective upon execution of an engagement letter.
In connection with the selection of Gries, the Board dismissed Marcum LLP as Old Nukk’s independent registered public accounting
firm on May 22, 2023. On November 3, 2023, Old Nukk was informed that Gries had sold its business to GreenGrowth CPAs (“GreenGrowth”).
On November 5, 2023, Old Nukk engaged and executed an agreement with GreenGrowth, as the Old Nukk’s new independent accountant to
replace Gries. As Gries was engaged by the Company on May 22, 2023, Gries has not issued a report on the Old Nukk’s financial statements.
The Board of Directors of Old Nukk, acting as the audit committee, approved the decision to change independent accountants. During the
fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, and through November 3, 2023, Old Nukk had no disagreements (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of
Regulation S-K and the related instructions to Item 304 of Regulation S-K) with Gries on any matter of accounting principles or practices,
financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Gries would
have caused Gries to make reference thereto in connection with its report.

The following table sets
forth the fees billed by our principal independent accountants for each of our last two fiscal years for the categories of services indicated.
