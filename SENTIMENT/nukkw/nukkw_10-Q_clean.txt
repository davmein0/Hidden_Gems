FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS

This report contains forward-looking statements
that involve a number of risks and uncertainties which are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange
Act”). Although our forward-looking statements reflect the good faith judgment of our management, these statements can be based
only on facts and factors of which we are currently aware. Consequently, forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and
uncertainties. Actual results and outcomes may differ materially from results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements.

Forward-looking statements can be identified by
the use of forward-looking words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “anticipate,” “believe,”
“expect,” “plan,” “future,” “intend,” “could,” “estimate,” “predict,”
“hope,” “potential,” “continue,” or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. These
statements include, but are not limited to, statements under the captions “Risk Factors,” “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis or Plan of Operation” and “Description of Business,” as well as other sections in this report. Such forward-looking
statements are based on our management’s current plans and expectations and are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in plans
that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. You should be aware that,
as a result of any of these factors materializing, the trading price of our common stock may decline. These factors include, but are not
limited to, the following:

●

the availability and adequacy of capital to support and grow our business;

●

economic, competitive, business and other conditions in our local and regional markets;

●

actions taken or not taken by others, including competitors, as well as legislative, regulatory, judicial and other governmental authorities;

●

competition in our industry;

●

changes in our business and growth strategy, capital improvements or development plans;

●

the availability of additional capital to support development; and

●

other factors discussed elsewhere in this quarterly report.

The cautionary statements made in this quarterly
report are intended to be applicable to all related forward-looking statements wherever they may appear in this report.

We urge you not to place undue reliance on these
forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward
looking-statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

All references in this Form 10-Q that refer to
the “Company”, “Nukkleus”, “we,” “us” or “our” refer to Nukkleus Inc. and
its consolidated subsidiaries.

NUKKLEUS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Unaudited)

NOTE 1 – 
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND
BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Nukkleus Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries,
were financial technology companies that were previously focused on providing software, technology solutions, customer sales and marketing,
and risk management technology hardware and software solutions packages for the worldwide retail foreign exchange (“FX”) trading
industry and payment services from one fiat currency to another or to digital assets.

In January 2024, Nukkleus Inc and its wholly owned
subsidiaries ceased its general support service operations, terminating the existing customer and supplier contracts with a related party,
and shifted its focus to the payment services operations. In November 2024, Nukkleus Inc. entered into a Settlement Agreement and Release
(the “Settlement Agreement”) with a shareholder and one of our subsidiaries to sell the subsidiary that operates the payment
services operations to the shareholder in consideration of GBP 
1,000
 (approximately $
1,372
 at June 30, 2025). The sale is subject to stockholder
approval as required under Nasdaq rules which is still pending.

In December 2024, Nukkleus Inc entered into a
Securities Purchase Agreement and Call Option (the “Star Agreement”) with Star 26 Capital Inc. (“Star”), the shareholders
of Star (“Star Equity Holders”) and an officer of Nukkleus, acting in his capacity as the representative of the Star Equity
Holders, to acquire a controlling 
51
% interest in Star, an Israeli corporation engaged as a supplier of generators for “iron dome”
launchers and other defense products. As a result of the Settlement Agreement and subject to the closing of the acquisition of Star, Nukkleus
Inc.’s business will be focused on the defense sector.

On February 14, 2025, the Board of Directors of
Nukkleus Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries approved a change in the Company’s fiscal year end from September 30 to December
31, effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2024. This change results in a transition period from October 1, 2024, to December
31, 2024.

The decision to change the fiscal year end was
made to align the Company’s financial reporting with the calendar year, which is expected to enhance operational efficiency, improve
comparability with industry peers, and better serve the needs of shareholders. Further, the Company intends to align its fiscal year with
Star.

Basis of Presentation and Principles of
Consolidation:
 On December 22, 2023 (the “Closing Date”), Brilliant Acquisition Corp (“Brilliant”) entered
into a business combination agreement (the “Business Combination”) with each of the shareholders of Nukkleus Inc. (“Old
Nukk”). Pursuant to the Business Combination, Brilliant acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock from the
Old Nukk shareholders.

On the Closing Date, and in connection with the
closing of the Business Combination, Brilliant changed its name to Nukkleus Inc (the “Company”) and the Company’s common
stock began trading on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol NUKK. Old Nukk was deemed the accounting acquirer in the Business Combination
based on an analysis of the criteria outlined in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805, 
Business Combinations

(“ASC 805”). The determination was primarily based on Old Nukk’s shareholders prior to the Business Combination having
a majority of the voting interests in the combined company, Old Nukk’s ability to exert control over the majority of the board of
directors of the combined company, and given the board of directors election and retention provisions, Old Nukk’s ability to maintain
control of the board of directors on a go-forward basis, Old Nukk’s senior management comprising the senior management of the combined
company; and old Nukk’s operations prior to the Business Combination comprise the ongoing operations of the combined company. Accordingly,
for accounting purposes, the Business Combination was treated as the equivalent of Old Nukk issuing stock for the net assets of Brilliant,
accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of Brilliant were stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets
recorded.

While Brilliant was the legal acquirer in the
Business Combination, because Old Nukk was deemed the accounting acquirer, the historical financial statements of Old Nukk became the
historical financial statements of the combined company, upon consummation of the Business Combination. As a result, the financial statements
included in this report reflect (i) the historical operating results of Old Nukk prior to the Business Combination; (ii) the combined
results of Brilliant and Old Nukk following the closing of the Business Combination; (iii) the assets and liabilities of Old Nukk at their
historical cost; and (iv) the Company’s equity structure for all periods presented.

6

Effective October 24, 2024, the Company amended
its amended and restated certificate of incorporation to implement a one-for-eight reverse stock split of its common stock (the “2024
Reverse Stock Split”) and increased the number of authorized shares of the Company’s common stock from 
40,000,000
 to 
150,000,000

(see Note 8).

In accordance with guidance applicable to these
circumstances, the equity structure has been restated in all comparative periods to give effect to the number of shares of the Company’s
common stock, $
0.0001
 par value per share, issued to Old Nukk shareholders during the Business Combination and the 2024 Reverse Stock
Split. Accordingly, the disclosure of common shares and per common share data in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and
related notes reflect the Business Combination and 2024 Reverse Stock Split for all periods presented.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Nukkleus Inc, and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon
consolidation. The consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and in accordance with the rules and regulations of the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Any reference in these footnotes to the applicable guidance is meant to refer
to the authoritative U.S. GAAP as found in the ASC and Accounting Standards Updates (“ASU”) of the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”).

The preparation of these financial statements
in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues, expenses and related disclosures. Due to the Company’s inability to access complete financial data from a subsidiary classified
as discontinued operations, estimates were used to present this entity’s financial results for the three months ended June 30, 2025
(see Note 4).

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability or classification of asset-carrying amounts or the amounts and
classification of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

NOTE 2 – 
LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities in the normal
course of business. As of June 30, 2025, the Company had cash of approximately $
1,520,000
, a working capital deficit of approximately
$
53,464,000
 and incurred cash flow used in operating activities from continuing operations of approximately $
2,981,000
 for the six months
ended June 30, 2025. These are indicators of substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for at
least one year from issuance of these consolidated financial statements. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is
dependent upon the management of expenses and ability to obtain necessary financing to meet its obligations and pay its liabilities arising
from normal business operations when they come due, and upon profitable operations.

If additional equity or debt financing is required
from outside sources, the Company may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to it or at all. If the Company is unable to raise additional
capital on acceptable terms when needed, its results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.
Any such financing likely would be dilutive to existing stockholders and could result in significant financial operating covenants that
would negatively impact the Company business.

As a result of the above, in connection with the
Company’s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-15,
“Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,” management has determined that
the Company’s liquidity condition raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern through
twelve months from the date these financial statements are available to be issued. These financial statements do not include any adjustments
relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be
unable to continue as a going concern.

NOTE 3 – 
SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Emerging growth company
: 
The Company
is an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (“JOBS”) Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging
growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act, until such
time as to those standards apply to private companies. The Company has elected to use this extended transition period for complying with
new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date
that it (i) is no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opts out of the extended transition
period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, these financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with the new or
revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.

Use of estimates: 
The preparation
of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Making estimates requires management to exercise significant
judgment. Such estimates may be subject to change as more current information becomes available and accordingly the actual results could
differ significantly from those estimates. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation
or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate,
could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly
from those estimates. The Company’s most significant estimates and judgments involve valuation of share-based compensation, valuation
of equity-classified stock purchase warrants, valuation of liability-classified stock purchase warrants, valuation of derivative liability,
classification of gains and losses on settlement of related party liabilities, the useful lives of long-lived assets, assumptions used
in assessing impairment of long-lived assets, valuation of deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowances, and estimates
of financial results for a subsidiary classified as discontinued operations. For the three months ended June 30, 2025, the Company used
estimates to report the financial results of this subsidiary.

Segment reporting: 
ASC 280, 
Segment
Reporting 
(“ASC 280”), defines operating segments as components of an enterprise where discrete financial information
is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision-maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources
and in assessing performance. 
The Company’s CODM is the 
chief executive officer
, who has ultimate responsibility for the operating
performance of the Company and the allocation of resources. The CODM uses operating results as the primary measure to manage the business.

As a result of transactions entered into during the three months ended December 31, 2024 (see Note 4), the CODM determined it has 
one

operating segment as of June 30, 2025. Accordingly, the Company has recast the presentation of its reportable segments for the periods
presented in these consolidated financial statements. The CODM assesses performance on consolidated operating expenses as the CODM is
focused on managing cash flow until a pending disposition (see Note 12) and a pending acquisition (see Note 12) are completed during the
third quarter of fiscal year 2025.

Cash and cash equivalents: 
The Company
considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity date of three months or less at the time of purchase and money market accounts
to be cash equivalents. The Company had 
no
 cash equivalents at June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024.

The Company’s cash and cash equivalents
are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Cash and cash equivalents are primarily placed with financial institutions which
are of high credit quality. The Company invests cash and cash equivalents primarily in highly liquid, highly rated instruments which are
uninsured. The Company may also have corporate deposit balances with financial institutions which exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation insurance limit of $
250,000
. The Company has not experienced losses on these accounts and does not believe it is exposed to
any significant credit risk with respect to these accounts.

Fair value measurements:
 ASC 820,

Fair Value Measurements
 (“ASC 820”), clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would
be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value
is a market-based measurement that should be determined based upon assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset
or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, ASC 820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the
inputs used in measuring fair value as follows

●

Level 1 – Inputs based on unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.

●

Level 2 – Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.

●

Level 3 – Inputs reflect management’s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. The inputs are both unobservable for the asset and liability in the market and significant to the overall fair value measurement.

An asset’s or liability’s fair value
measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
Valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value
are based on one or more of the following techniques noted in ASC 820:

●

Market approach:
 Prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities.

●

Cost approach: 
Amount that would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset (replacement cost).

●

Income approach:
 Techniques to convert future amounts to a single present value amount based upon market expectations (including present value techniques, option pricing, and excess earnings models).

The Company believes its valuation methods are
appropriate and consistent with other market participants, however the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the
fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

The Company’s financial instruments with
a carrying value that approximates fair value consist of cash, advances, other current assets, accounts payable, due to affiliates, accrued
expenses and other current liabilities, interest payable – related parties, and short-term borrowings due to their liquid or short-term
nature or expected settlement dates of these instruments. If these financial instruments were recorded at fair value, they would be based
on Level 1 inputs, except for short-term borrowings which would be based on Level 2 and Level 3 inputs, respectively.

The Company’s non-financial assets, such
as intangible assets, and financial assets are adjusted to fair value when an impairment charge is recognized. The impairment charge recognized
on non-financial assets that consist of acquired intangible assets is based on Level 3 inputs, including a comparison of the Company’s
results with expectations and expectation for future profits. The impairment charge recognized for financial assets that consist of investment
in privately held equity securities is based on Level 3 inputs, including the global economic environment, adjustments for investment-specific
developments and the rights and obligations of the securities the Company holds.

The Company’s financial instruments that
are measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of liability-classified stock purchase warrants and liability-classified derivative
financial instruments (see Note 10).

9

Related parties: 
The Company considers
parties to be related if one party has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or exercise significant influence
over the other party in making financial and operating decisions. Parties are also considered to be related if they are subject to common
control or significant influence of the same party, such as a family member or relative, shareholder, or a related corporation. The Company
reviews the relationships of its vendors, customers, shareholders, and board members to determine whether there are any parties meet the
criteria to be considered related. Any party that is deemed to be related to the Company is referred to as an “affiliate”
or “related party” in these consolidated financial statements.

Due from affiliates and notes receivable
– related parties, net:
 Due from affiliates and notes receivable – related parties, net are contractual rights to
receive cash on demand or on fixed or determinable dates and are recognized as an asset on the consolidated balance sheets. Due from affiliates
consist of amounts owed from affiliates of the Company for either services provided to the affiliate or expenses paid by the Company on
behalf of the affiliate (see Note 11). Notes receivable – related parties, net consist of advances made to affiliates in exchange
for a promissory note from the affiliate (see Note 11).

Other current assets:
 Other current
assets primarily consist of escrow cash and prepaid miscellaneous items. The Company expects all current assets to be collected and/or
realized within the next 12 months.

Leases: 
The Company determines if
an arrangement is a lease at inception of the contract. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”)
assets, current portion of operating lease liabilities, and operating lease liabilities, net of current portion in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets.

ROU assets represent the Company’s right
to use underlying assets for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising
from the contracts. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments
over the lease term.

The Company’s vehicle leases may include
transfer rights or options to purchase at the end of the lease that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise. Interest expense is
recognized using the effective interest rate method, and the ROU asset is amortized over the useful life of the underlying asset.

Impairment of long-lived assets:

In accordance with ASC 360, 
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
 (“ASC 360”), the Company reviews the carrying
values of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets
may not be fully recoverable. Based on the existence of one or more indicators of impairment, the Company measures any impairment of long-lived
assets using the projected discounted cash flow method at the asset group level. The estimation of future cash flows requires significant
management judgment based on the Company’s historical results and anticipated results and is subject to many factors. The discount
rate that is commensurate with the risk inherent in the Company’s business model is determined by its management. An impairment
loss would be recorded if the Company determined that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. The impairment to
be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying values of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets.

Note payable, loans payable – related
parties, convertible notes payable:
 Debt issuance costs, including original issue discounts, will be recorded to debt discount,
reducing the face amount of the note. Debt issuance costs will be amortized to interest expense over the contractual term of the respective
debt obligation using the effective interest method. If a conversion of the underlying debt occurs, a proportionate share of the unamortized
discount is immediately expensed.

10

The Company evaluates convertible notes payable
in accordance with ASC 470, “
Debt with Conversion and Other Options
” (“ASC 470”) to determine if embedded
conversion features present in the convertible instrument shall be recognized separately at issuance by allocating a portion of the proceeds
equal to the intrinsic value of that feature to additional paid-in capital. Debt issuance costs are allocated proportionately to the debt
host and conversion feature.

Derivative financial instruments:

The Company accounts for derivative instruments in accordance with ASC 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging 
(“ASC 815”). The
Company’s objectives and strategies for using derivative instruments, and how the derivative instruments and related hedged items
are accounted for affect the consolidated financial statements. The Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to
cash flow, market, or foreign currency risk.

The Company evaluates all of its financial instruments,
including notes payable and warrants, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives.
The Company applies significant judgment to identify and evaluate complex terms and conditions in its contracts and agreements to determine
whether embedded derivatives exist. Embedded derivatives must be separately measured from the host contract if all the requirements for
bifurcation are met. The assessment of the conditions surrounding the bifurcation of embedded derivatives depends on the nature of the
host contract. Bifurcated embedded derivatives are recognized at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in the statement of
operations each period. Bifurcated embedded derivatives are classified with the related host contract on the Company’s balance sheet.

An evaluation of specifically identified conditions
is made to determine whether the fair value of the derivative issued is required to be classified as equity or as a derivative liability.
Changes in the estimated fair value of the liability-classified derivative financial instruments are recognized as a non-cash gain or
loss on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

Stock purchase warrants:
 The Company
accounts for stock purchase warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s
specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480, 
Distinguishing liabilities from equity
 (“ASC 480”),
and ASC 815. The assessment considers whether the stock purchase warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC
480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the stock purchase warrants meet all of the requirements
for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the stock purchase warrants are indexed to the Company’s own common
shares and whether the holders could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a circumstance outside of the Company’s
control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted
at the time of issuance, modification, and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the stock purchase warrants are outstanding.

For issued or modified stock purchase warrants
that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the stock purchase warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional
paid-in capital at the time of issuance.

For issued or modified stock purchase warrants
that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the stock purchase warrants are required to be recorded at their initial
fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the liability classified
stock purchase warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive
loss.

The Company assesses the classification of its
common stock purchase warrants at each reporting date to determine whether a change in classification between equity and liability
is required. For modified stock purchase warrants that result in a change of classification from equity to liability, a liability is recognized
equal to the fair value on the date of modification, additional paid-in capital is adjusted by the fair value of the warrant on the date
of issuance, and the difference is recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive loss.

11

Assets held for sale: 
Assets held
for sale represent property, equipment, and leasehold improvements less accumulated depreciation as well as any other assets that are
held for sale in conjunction with the sale of a business. The Company records assets held for sale in accordance with ASC 360 at
the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. Fair value is the amount obtainable from the sale of the asset in an arm’s
length transaction. The reclassification takes place when the assets are available for immediate sale and the sale is highly probable.
These conditions are usually met from the date on which a letter of intent or agreement to sell is ready for signing.

Discontinued operations: 
A component
of an entity is identified as operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished, operationally and financially, from the rest
of the entity. Under ASC 205-20, “
Presentation of Financial Statements - Discontinued Operations
” (“ASC 205-20”),
a discontinued operation is a component of an entity that either has been disposed of, or is classified as held for sale and represents
a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on the entity’s operations and financial results, or a newly acquired business
or nonprofit activity that upon acquisition is classified as held for sale. Discontinued operations are presented separately from continuing
operations in the consolidated statements of Operations and the consolidated statements of cash flows (see Note 4). For long-lived assets
or disposals groups that are classified as held for sale but do not meet the criteria for discontinued operations, the assets
and liabilities are presented separately on the balance sheet of the initial period in which it is classified as held for sale.

Advertising: 
Costs related to advertising
are expensed as incurred.

Stock-based compensation: 
The Company
accounts for stock-based compensation by measuring and recognizing compensation expense for all share-based awards, including stock options
and stock grants, based on estimated grant-date fair values. The Company measures employee, director and nonemployee awards at the date
of grant, which generally is the date at which the Company and the nonemployee reach a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions
of a share-based payment award.

The Company estimates the grant date fair value
of each stock option award using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The model requires management to make a number of assumptions,
including the fair value and expected volatility of the Company’s underlying common stock price on the date of grant, expected live
of the option, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield. The Company sets the grant date fair value of each stock grant equal
to the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant.

The Company uses the straight-line attribution
method to allocate compensation cost to reporting periods over the requisite service period during which the employee, board member, director,
or advisor is required to provide services in exchange for the award. The Company has elected to account for forfeitures of awards
as they occur, with previously recognized compensation reversed in the period that the awards are forfeited.

Income taxes: 
The Company accounts
for income taxes using the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences
between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences
are expected to affect taxable income. A valuation allowance is established when management estimates that it is more likely than not
that deferred tax assets will not be realized. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future pre-tax earnings, the reversal
of temporary differences between book and tax income, and the expected rates in future periods.

The Company is required to evaluate the tax positions
taken in the course of preparing its tax returns to determine whether tax positions are more likely than not of being sustained by the
applicable tax authority. Tax benefits of positions not deemed to meet the “more-likely-than-not” threshold would be recorded
as a tax expense in the current year. The amount recognized is subject to estimate and management judgment with respect to the likely
outcome of each uncertain tax position. The amount that is ultimately sustained for an individual uncertain tax position or for all uncertain
tax positions in the aggregate could differ from the amount that is initially recognized. The Company recognizes interest and penalties
related to income tax matters in general and administrative expense.

For U.S. federal tax purposes, digital asset transactions
are treated on the same tax principles as property transactions. The Company recognizes a gain or loss when digital assets are exchanged
for other property, in the amount of the difference between the fair market value of the property received and the tax basis of the exchanged
digital assets. Receipts of digital assets in exchange for goods or services are included in taxable income at the fair market value on
the date of receipt.

12

Foreign currency translation: 
The
Company’s consolidated financial statements are presented in the reporting currency of the U.S. dollar. Functional currencies of
the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries is the local currency used in each entities primary economic environment, some of which
are different than the reporting currency. Assets and liabilities of the Company are translated into the reporting currency using the
exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet dates. Equity transactions are translated using the historical exchange rate in effect on
the date of the transaction, except for the change in accumulated deficit during the year, which is the results of the operations translation
process. Results of operations and cash flows are translated using the weighted average exchange rates in effect during the period. As
a result, amounts relating to the assets and liabilities reported on the statements of cash flows may not necessarily agree with the changes
in the corresponding balances on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Translation adjustments resulting from the process of translating
the local currency financial statements into the reporting currency are recorded as a component of comprehensive income (loss). The realized
foreign currency exchange gain (loss) and the unrealized foreign currency exchange gain (loss) for the three and six months ended June
30, 2025 and 2024 is included as a component of net loss from discontinued operations on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations
and comprehensive loss.

Remeasurement gains and losses from transactions
that are not denominated in the functional currency are recorded as a component of other income in the consolidated statements of operations
and comprehensive loss. Most of the Company’s revenue transactions are transacted in the functional currency of the Company. The
Company does not enter into any material transaction in foreign currencies. Transaction gains or losses have not had, and are not expected
to have, a material effect on the results of operations of the Company.

Comprehensive loss: 
Comprehensive
loss is comprised of net loss and all changes to the statements of equity, except those due to investments by stockholders, changes in
paid-in capital and distributions to stockholders. For the Company, comprehensive loss for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025
and 2024 consisted of net loss and unrealized loss from foreign currency translation adjustment.

Net loss per share: 
Basic earnings
per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares 
outstanding
during the period, excluding the effects of any potential dilutive securities. Diluted earnings per share is computed similar to basic
earnings per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding
if the potential common share equivalents had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. Earnings per share excludes
all potential dilutive shares of common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2025
and 2024, potentially dilutive common shares consist of the common shares issuable upon the exercise of common stock options and warrants
(using the treasury stock method) and the conversion of convertible notes payable. In a period in which the Company has a net loss, all
potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the computation of diluted shares outstanding as they would have had an anti-dilutive
impact.

The following table summarizes the potentially
dilutive securities excluded from the computation of diluted shares outstanding because the effect of including these potential shares
was anti-dilutive:

NOTE 4 – 
DISCONTINUED
OPERATIONS

In accordance with ASC 205-20 Presentation of
Financial Statements: Discontinued Operations, a disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity is required
to be reported as discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major impact on an entity’s
operations and financial results when the components of an entity meets the criteria in ASC paragraph 
205
-
20
-
45
-
10.
 In
the period in which the component meets the held for sale or discontinued operations criteria the major assets, other assets, current
liabilities and non-current liabilities shall be reported as a component of total assets and liabilities separate from those balances
of the continuing operations. At the same time, the results of all discontinued operations, less applicable income taxes (benefit), shall
be reported as components of net income (loss) separate from the income (loss) of continuing operations.

Disposition of a Subsidiary: 
On
November 8, 2024, the Company entered into a Settlement Agreement and Release (the “Settlement Agreement”) with a shareholder
of the Company and a subsidiary of the Company to sell the subsidiary to the shareholder or his nominee subject to the Company obtaining
shareholder approval. As required by the Settlement Agreement, a Share Purchase Agreement was entered into between the same parties dated
December 23, 2024 providing that the Company, subject to it obtaining shareholder approval, will sell the subsidiary to the officer of
the Company in consideration of GBP 
1,000
 (approximately $
1,372
 at June 30, 2025).

The subsidiary comprises our financial services
operating segment. As a result of the planned disposition of the subsidiary, the financial services operating segment meets the held for
sale criteria of ASC 205-20. Accordingly, the historical results of operations of the financial services operating segment has been reflected
as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statement for all periods prior to the Settlement Agreement on November 8, 2024.

During the preparation of the consolidated
financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, management was unable to obtain complete financial data from the
subsidiary due to the subsidiary’s personnel being uncooperative, not providing the information needed and loss of direct
access to the subsidiary’s systems. As a result, the financial results of the discontinued operations for the three months
ended June 30, 2025 are based on reasonable estimates derived from historical operating trends and partial information available to
the Company. Management believes the estimates used are reasonable under the circumstances.

NOTE 6 – 
NOTE PAYABLE,
NET

In April 2024, the Company issued a promissory
note in the principal amount of $
78,000
 to an investor in consideration of cash proceeds in the same amount (the “April 2024
Loan”). In addition, the Company issued a stock purchase warrant for the purchase of 
14,535
 shares of the Company’s
common stock (the “April 2024 Warrant”) that is exercisable for 
three years
 at an exercise price of $
0.86
 per warrant. The
April 2024 Loan bears interest of 
8.0
% per annum and is due and payable on April 30, 2025. The April 2024 Warrant was determined
to be an equity classified warrant and fair value of $
40,804
   determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with
the following assumptions: volatility of 
174.03
%, risk-free rate of 
4.87
%, annual dividend yield of 
0.0
% and expected life
of 
3
 years. The principal amount of the April 2024 Loan was allocated to the April 2024 Loan and April 2024 Warrant in the amount
of $
37,196
 and $
40,804
, respectively. The amount allocated to the April 2024 Warrant was recorded as a discount on the April 2024 Loan.
In April 2025, the April 2024 Loan was repaid in full.

Amortization of the debt discount and interest
expense related to the April 2024 Loan amounted to $
3,400
 and $
496
, and $
13,601
 and $
2,035
, respectively, for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2025 and $
6,801
 and $
1,043
, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, which are both included
as a component of interest expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

The balance of the April 2024 Loan, net of unamortized
discount, was 
$0
 and $
64,399
 as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively and reflected as note payable, net on the accompanying

August 2024 Note:
 In August 2024, the Company
issued a senior unsecured promissory note (the “August 2024 Note”) in the principal amount of $
515,000
 to a new lender
in consideration of cash proceeds in the amount of $
412,075
. The August 2024 Note bears interest of 
12.0
% per annum and is due and
payable six months after issuance. The lender shall have the right to convert the principal and interest payable under the August 2024
Note into shares of common stock of the Company. In addition, the Company issued the lender
a stock purchase warrant (the “August 2024 Warrant”) to acquire 
175,000
 shares of common stock at a per share price
of $
2.00
 for a term of 
five years
 that may be exercised for cash. The number of shares and exercise
prices for the August 2024 Note and August 2024 Warrant reflect the October 2024 reverse stock split.

The August 2024 Warrant was determined to be an
equity classified warrant and fair value was calculated as $
447,316
 using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:
volatility of 
183.31
%, risk-free rate of 
3.84
%, annual dividend yield of 
0.0
% and expected life of 
five
 years.
The Company recorded a total debt discount of $
342,314
 related to the original issue discount and August 2024 Warrant, which will be amortized
over the term of the August 2024 Note. The principal amount of the August 2024 Note was allocated to the August 2024 Note and the August
2024 Warrant in the amount of $
275,611
 and $
239,389
, respectively. The amount allocated to the original issue discount and the August
2024 Warrant were recorded as a discount on the August 2024 Note, which will be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest
rate method over the term of the August 2024 Note.

In June 2025, the lender sold August 2024 Note
and the August 2024 Warrant to an unaffiliated third party.

18

December 2024 Note:
 On December 3, 2024,
the Company issued a convertible promissory note (the “December 2024 Note”) in the principal amount of $
500,000
 to a
lender, in consideration of cash proceeds in the amount of $
450,000
 after an original issue discount of $
25,000
 and issuance costs
of $
25,000
 in connection with the standby equity purchase agreement executed with the lender (the “SEPA”). The December 2024
Note matures on December 3, 2025. The SEPA was subsequently terminated in December 2024. The December 2024 Note has the following features:

Conversion rights
 – The
December 2024 Note and accrued and unpaid interest is convertible at the option of the lender (the “Conversion Option”) into
shares of the Company’s common stock at a per share conversion price of the lower of (i) $
2.00
 per share (the “Fixed Price”)
and (ii) 
90
% of the lowest daily volume weighted average price (the “VWAP”) during the 
ten
 consecutive trailing
 days
 immediately
preceding the conversion, with a floor of $
0.33
 (the “Floor Price”).

Interest
 – The December
2024 Note bears interest of 
10.0
% per annum. Upon an event of default, the December 2024 Note becomes immediately due and payable,
with the interest increasing to 
18.0
%.

Optional redemption 
–
The December 2024 Note is redeemable by the Company in the event that the VWAP of the Company’s common stock was less than the Fixed
Price on the date the Company provides the redemption notice to the lender. The redemption price will be equal to the outstanding principal
amount of the December 2024 Note plus the 
10
% of the principal amount being redeemed (the “Redemption Premium”) plus all accrued
and unpaid interest, if any. The lender has ten days from the date the redemption notice is received to elect to convert all or a portion
of the December 2024 Note.

Event of Default – 
If
any event of default as defined in the December 2024 Note occurs, the full unpaid principal amount of the December 2024 Note, accrued
and unpaid interest, and other amounts owed become at the lender’s election immediately due and payable in cash. The lender has
the right, but not the obligation, to convert all or part of the December 2024 Note in accordance with the terms of the December 2024
Note.

Exchange Cap
 – The lender
shall not have the right to convert any portion of the December 2024 Note to the extent that after giving effect to such conversion, the
lender, along with its affiliates, would beneficially own in excess of 
4.99
% of the outstanding common stock immediately after giving
effect to such conversion (the “Exchange Cap”), unless the Company has obtained shareholder approval for conversion.

Amortization Event
 – In
no event shall the lender be allowed to effect a conversion if such conversion, along with all other shares of common stock then beneficially
owned by the lender and its affiliates would exceed 
4.99
% of the then outstanding shares of the common stock of the Company. If at any
time (i) the daily VWAP is less than the Floor Price for 
three
 trading
 days
 during a period of 
five
 consecutive trading
 days
 (a “Floor
Price Event”), (ii) the Company has issued in excess of 
99.0
% of the shares of common stock available under the Exchange Cap (an
“Exchange Cap Event”), or (iii) at any time after the effectiveness deadline set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement,
dated as of December 3, 2024, by and between the Company and the lender (the “Registration Rights Agreement”), the lender
is unable to utilize a registration statement to resell the shares of the Company’s common stock receivable by the lender for a
period of 
ten
 consecutive trading
 days
 (a “Registration Event,” and collectively with a Floor Price Event and an Exchange
Cap Event, each an “Amortization Event”), then the Company shall make monthly payments to the lender beginning on the seventh
trading day after the Amortization Event and continuing monthly in the amount of $
150,000
 plus a 
10.0
% premium and accrued and unpaid
interest. The Exchange Cap Event will not apply in the event the Company has obtained the approval from its stockholders for the issuance
of shares of common stock pursuant to the conversion of the December 2024 Note in excess of the Exchange Cap.

Embedded Derivatives
 –
The optional redemption and event of default include an exercise contingency, which requires the Company to obtain shareholder approved
for conversions subject to the Exchange Cap, which fails the equity classification guidance in ASC 815 and is thus precluded from being
classified in equity. Therefore, the embedded derivatives are required to be bifurcated from the December 2024 Note and accounted for
at fair value at each reporting date. A fair value of $
222,865
 was determined for the embedded derivative liabilities using a Monte Carlo
Simulation model. The embedded derivative liabilities will be re-measured to fair value each reporting period until settlement (see Note
10).

During the three months ended June 30, 2025, the
lender exercised conversion of the December 2024 Note and 
260,300
 shares of common stock were issued to the lender.

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2025,
amortization of debt discount and interest expense related to convertible promissory notes amounted to $
183,377
 and $
19,709
, and $
308,646

and $
47,276
, respectively, which are both included as a component of interest expense on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements
of operations and comprehensive loss.

NOTE 8 – 
STOCKHOLDERS’
DEFICIT

As a result of the 2024 Reverse Stock Split, each

Common Stock Issuances:

On December 18, 2024, the Company entered into
a securities purchase agreement for a private placement (the “Private Placement”) pursuant to which an investor purchased
from the Company 
1,666,666
 units for an aggregate purchase price of $
9,999,996
 or a per unit price of $
6.00
 with each unit consisting
of (i) 
one
 share of the Company’s common stock and (ii) a stock purchase warrant to purchase up to one and one half shares of the
Company’s common stock (the “Private Placement Warrant”). The investor may elect to acquire one pre-funded common stock
purchase warrant in lieu of one share (the “Pre-Funded Warrant”). The Units were priced in excess of the average Nasdaq Official
Closing Price of the Company’s common stock for the five trading days immediately preceding the signing of the Private Placement.
The Private Placement closed on December 20, 2024. Issuance costs totaled $
865,143
 and were recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in
capital. On December 19, 2024, 
230,000
 shares of common stock were issued in connection with the Private Placement.

The Pre-funded Warrant and the Private Placement
Warrant permit the investor to acquire a fixed amount of shares of the Company’s common stock at a per share price of $
0.0001
 and
$
6.00
, respectively, that may be exercised on a cash or cashless basis. The Pre-Funded Warrant is immediately exercisable, at a nominal
exercise price of $
0.0001
 per share, and may be exercised at any time until the Pre-Funded Warrant is fully exercised. The Private Placement
Warrant has an exercise price of $
6.00
 per share, is immediately exercisable on a cash or cashless basis and will expire five years from
the date of issuance. The Pre-funded Warrant and the Private Placement Warrant were determined to be liability-classified at the time
of issuance.

20

In February 2025, the
investor sold 
83,333
 and 
125,000
 units of the Pre-funded Warrant and Private Placement Warrant, respectively, to a third party. In February
2025, the third party submitted a cashless exercise of their 
83,333
 units in relation to the Pre-Funded Warrant, which resulted in an
issuance of 
83,332
 shares of common stock.

In April 2025, the Company
issued 
12,500
 shares of common stock in connection with a settlement agreement with a former consultant.

In May 2025, the Company
issued 
84,276
 shares of common stock to a consultant in connection with a cashless exercise of an option.

In May and June 2025,
the Company issued a total of 
260,300
 shares of common stock to a lender in connection with the full conversion of the December 2024 Note
(see Note 7).

During the six months
ending June 30, 2024, the Company issued 
25,338
 and 
87,500
 shares of common stock to settle obligations to vendors.

Warrants:

Public Warrants: 
On June 26, 2020, Brilliant
completed an initial public offering that included warrants for shares of common stock (the “Public Warrants’). Each Public
Warrant entitles the holder the right to purchase 
one
 share of common stock at an exercise price of $
11.50
 per share. No fractional shares
will be issued upon exercise of the Public Warrants. The Company may elect to redeem the Public Warrants, in whole and not in part, at
a price of $
0.01
 per Public Warrant if (i) 
30
 days’ prior written notice of redemption is provided to the holders, and (ii) the
last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock equals or exceeds $
16.50
 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends,
reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third business day
prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. Upon issuance of a redemption notice by
the Company, the warrant holders have a period of 
30
 days to exercise for cash, or on a cashless basis. On the Closing Date, there were

805,000
 Public Warrants issued and outstanding.

Private Warrants: 
Simultaneous with Brilliant’s
initial public offering in June 2020, Brilliant sold warrants to its sponsor and certain of its directors and advisors in a private placement
(the “Private Warrants”). The Private Warrants may not be redeemed by the Company so long as the Private Warrants are held
by the initial purchasers, or such purchasers’ permitted transferees. The Private Warrants have terms and provisions identical to
the Public Warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period, except if the Private Warrants are held by someone
other than the initial purchasers’ permitted transferees, then the Private Warrants are redeemable by the Company and exercisable
by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants. On the Closing Date, there were 
32,625
 Private Warrants issued and outstanding.

As a result of the Business Combination which
was completed on December 22, 2023, Public Warrants and Private Warrants totaling 
837,625
 were converted into 
837,625
 warrants
of the Company.

Stock Purchase Warrants:
 In connection
with certain note payable agreements (see Note 6) certain convertible notes payable (see Note 7), and the Private Placement (see Note
8) the Company issued stock purchase warrants to certain lenders and investors that permit the lender or investor to acquire a fixed amount
of shares of the Company’s common stock at a per share price that ranges between $
.0001
 and $
6.88
 for a term that ranges between
three and five years that may be exercised on a cash or cashless basis.

Certain warrants were determined to be equity-classified
at issuance, and as such, were recorded to additional-paid-in capital at the time of issuance. Certain warrants were determined to be
liability-classified at issuance, and as such, were recorded at fair value as a liability on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
and re-measured to fair value each reporting period with the change in fair value recorded as a component of other income (expense) on
the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Certain warrants were modified during the three months
ended December 31, 2024 at which time the warrant’s classification was re-assessed and the classification changed from equity to
liability.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

Old Nukk Equity Incentive Plan

For periods prior to the reverse recapitalization,
the Old Nukk Equity Incentive Plan (the “Old Nukk Plan”) permitted the granting of various awards including stock options
(including both nonqualified options and incentive options), stock appreciate rights (“SARs”), stock awards, phantom stock
units, performance awards and other share-based awards to employees, outside directors and consultants, and advisors to the Company. Only
stock options have been awarded to consultants and advisors under the Old Nukk Plan.

Assumed Options converted into an option to purchase
a number of shares of the Company’s common stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Old Nukk common stock and the Exchange
Ratio at an exercise price per share equal to the exercise price of the Assumed Options divided by the Exchange Ratio. Each Assumed Option
is governed by the same terms and conditions applicable to the Assumed Options prior to the Business Combination. No further grants can
be made under the Old Nukk Plan.

2024 Equity Incentive Plan

On October 11, 2024, the Company’s shareholders
approved a new long-term incentive award plan (the “2024 Plan”). The 2024 Plan is administered by the Board. The selection
of participants, allotment of shares, determination of price and other conditions are approved by the Board at its sole discretion to
attract and retain personnel instrumental to the success of the Company.

On November 13, 2024, the Company issued 
100,000

stock options to a consultant of the Company at an exercise price of $
2.39
 per share. In May 2025, the consultant exercised these options
via a cashless exercise, resulting in an issuance of 
84,276
 shares of common stock.

2025 Equity Incentive Plan

In February 2025, the Company established the
Nukkleus Inc 2025 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2025 Plan”) to attract, retain and motivate employees, officers, directors,
consultants, agents, advisors and independent contractors of the Company by providing them the opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest
in the Company and to align their interest and efforts to the long-term interest of the Company’s stockholders. The 2025 Plan will
be administered by the Board of Directors and has 
1,950,000
 shares of the Company’s common stock reserved for issuance. The 2025
Plan is subject to shareholder approval at a meeting expected to occur during the third quarter of calendar year 2025.

Stock options generally vest over one to three
years, with a maximum term of ten years from the date of grant. These awards become available to the recipient upon the satisfaction a

NOTE 10 – 
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

Customer digital currency assets and liabilities
represent the Company’s obligation to safeguard customer digital currencies. Accordingly, the Company has valued the assets and
liabilities using quoted market prices for the underlying digital currencies which is based on Level 2 inputs.

The Black-Scholes option pricing model is used
to estimate fair value of liability-classified stock purchase warrants issued in connection with convertible notes (see Note 7) and the
liability-classified pre-funded stock purchase warrants issued in connection with the December 2024 Private Placement (see Note 8). A
Monte Carlo simulation model is used to estimate the fair value of liability-classified stock purchase warrants issued in connection with
the December 2024 Private Placement (see Note 8). Both models utilize the following assumptions:

●

Risk-free interest rates are derived from the yield on U.S. Treasury debt securities in effect on the date of measurement.

●

Dividend yields are based on our historical dividend payments, which have been zero to date.

●

Volatility is estimated from historical volatility of a peer group over a similar period.

●

The expected term is based on the time to expiration of the warrants from the date of measurement.

The Monte Carlo simulation model also incorporates
management’s judgments for the occurrence or non-occurrence of certain events as well as the probability of certain scenarios impactful
to the valuation of the liability-classified stock purchase warrants issued in connection with the December 2024 Private Placement.

The assumptions used for the Black-Scholes option

NOTE 12 – 
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Indemnifications:

The Company has indemnity agreements with certain officers and directors of the Company pursuant to which the Company must indemnify
the officer or director against all expenses, judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement reasonably incurred in connection
with a third party proceeding, if the indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to
the best interests of the Company, and in the case of a criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the indemnitee’s
conduct was unlawful. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential exposure under these indemnification agreements: (i)
because the facts and circumstances involved in each claim are unique and the Company cannot predict the number or nature of claims
that may be made; (ii) due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement; and (iii) due to the
requirement for a registration of the Company’s securities before any of the indemnification obligations contemplated in the IRA
become effective.

Legal
and regulatory proceedings:
 The Company is subject to various litigation, regulatory investigations, and other legal proceedings that
arise in the ordinary course of its business. The Company is also subject to regulatory oversight by numerous regulatory and other governmental
agencies. The Company reviews its lawsuits, regulatory investigations, and other legal proceedings on an ongoing basis and provides disclosure
and records loss contingencies in accordance with the loss contingencies accounting guidance. In accordance with such guidance, the Company
establishes accruals for such matters when potential losses become probable and can be reasonably estimated. If the Company determines
that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, the Company discloses the possible loss in the consolidated
financial statements.

a result, the investor was entitled to penalties payable in cash until

If, for a period of 12 months after the closing
of the Star Agreement, the Company’s shares of common stock are delisted from Nasdaq, Star shall have the right, at its own discretion,
to require the Company to exchange the Investment Note for all the shares of Star then held by the Company, provided, however, the Option
shall be automatically cancelled and Star shall retain any cash payments made by the Company to Star and the Company shall retain an equity
interest in Star equivalent to all cash payments. The closing of the Transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including
regulatory approvals, third-party consents, fairness opinion, and approval by the Company’s shareholders as required under applicable
Nasdaq listing rules.

If the Star Agreement is canceled because stockholder
approval was not obtained within 90-days after the date of the Star Agreement and the failure was a result of the Company failing to perform
or observe the covenants or agreements of the Company provided for in the terms of the Star Agreement, the Seller is entitled to damages
of $
3,000,000
 from the Company.

As a result of the Settlement Agreement and subject
to the closing of the acquisition of Star, the Company’s business will be focused on the defense sector.

NOTE 13 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

The Company evaluated subsequent events and transactions
that occurred after the balance sheet date up to the date that the financial statements were issued. Based upon this review, other than
as described below, the Company did not identify any subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the financial
statements.

In August 2025, the Company determined that it
no longer had a controlling financial interest in Digital RFQ due to loss of access to financial records. Accordingly, the Company expects
to deconsolidate Digital RFQ during the third quarter of fiscal year 2025. The results of discontinued operations for the three months
ended June 30, 2025 remain included in these financial statements on an estimated basis (see Note 4).

On August 5, 2025, the Company was notified that
on July 29, 2025, Match Financial Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, was placed into administration in the United Kingdom
pursuant to the Insolvency Act 1986 resulting in the appointment of two administrators (the “Administrators”) and the Administrators
completed a pre-packaged sale of Match Financial’s entire shareholding in DRFQ to Match Financial Holdings Limited, a newly formed entity
owned by Mr. Khurshid, for nominal consideration of £
102,000
. The Company is consulting with UK counsel regarding this matter.

On July 25, 2025, the Company entered into Amendment
No. 4 to the Star Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of Amendment No. 4, Menachem Shalom, the holder of all Class B common stock of Star,
agreed that all said shares shall be converted to Class A common stock of Star. The objective of such cancellation and conversion is to
eliminate the disparity between the voting rights and the economic rights of the common stock of Star.

On July 30, 2025 the Company entered into a warrant
agreement with Synthetic Darwin LLC (“Darwin”), enabling the Company to acquire up to 
200
 million Darwin tokens, a new class
of self-evolving AI network tokens developed by Darwin. Darwin is a self-training and evolving AI that can be used to test and simulate
multiple scenarios in finance, healthcare and defense. This software aims to allow companies to run scenarios and find the best configuration
for financial services, drugs, defense-related software and more. The Company has identified the potential in such AI software and decided
to enter into this warrant agreement for Darwin tokens, which will allow the Company and the Company’s future subsidiaries to use
this platform.

Between July 2, 2025 and August 11, 2025, a total
of 
1,333,352
 of the Company’s Pre-Funded Warrants were exercised on a cashless basis, resulting in a total issuance of 
1,333,333

shares of common stock during the same period.

On August 11, 2025, the Company entered into a
settlement agreement with the current holder (the “Holder”) of the August 2024 Note and August 2024 Warrant. Pursuant to the
terms of the settlement agreement, the Holder agreed to waive all events of default in relation to the August 2024 Note. Additionally,
the Holder agreed to convert the August 2024 Note into 
243,155
 shares of common stock based on the post-reverse stock split conversion
price of $
2.50
 per share. In consideration of such waiver and conversion, the Company agreed to issue to the Holder a pre-funded warrant
to purchase 1,702,088 shares of the Company’s common stock. Furthermore, on August 11, 2025, the Company agreed to exchange the
August 2024 Warrant for a new warrant (the “Exchange Warrant”) in form and substance similar to the August 2024 Warrant, provided
that such Exchange Warrant permitted the Holder to exercise such Exchange Warrant on a cashless basis. The Holder then exercised the Exchange
Warrant on a cashless basis, resulting in an issuance of 
123,860
 shares of the Company’s common stock.

Overview

We are a financial technology
company that was historically focused on providing software, technology solutions, customer sales and marketing, and risk management technology
hardware and software solutions packages for the worldwide retail foreign exchange (“FX”) trading industry and payment services
from one fiat currency to another or to digital assets.

In December 2024, we entered
into a Securities Purchase Agreement and Call Option (the “Star Agreement”) with Star 26 Capital Inc. (“Star”),
the shareholders of Star (“Star Equity Holders”) and an officer of Nukkleus, acting in his capacity as the representative
of the Star Equity Holders, to acquire a controlling 51% interest in Star, an Israeli corporation engaged as a supplier of generators
for “iron dome” launchers and other defense products. On February 11, 2025, the Company, Star and the Star Equity Holders,
entered into an Amendment No. 1 to the Star Agreement (the “Amendment”) providing that the consideration to be invested by
the Company into Star shall be increased. Mr. Shalom, who is the Chief Executive Officer and a director of the
Company, is a controlling shareholder, Chief Executive Officer and a director of Star. Pursuant to the Star Agreement, the Company at
closing will acquire 51% of the issued and outstanding capital of Star in consideration of (i) $15,000,000 in a combination of cash in
the minimum amount of $5,000,000 and a promissory note for the remaining balance maturing in 12 months following the closing (the “Investment
Note”), (ii) the Company issuing the Seller 2,385,170 shares of common stock of the Company and (iii) the Company issuing Star a
five-year warrant to purchase an aggregate of 6,907,859 shares of the Company’s common stock for an exercise price of $1.50 per
share. The Star Equity Holders granted the Company an option (the “Option”) to purchase the balance of their equity in Star
(49%) for an aggregate of $16,084,250 (the “Option Exercise Price”) in consideration for the issuance to the Star Equity Holders
five-year warrants to purchase an aggregate of 720,000 shares of the Company’s common stock for an exercise price of $1.50 per share.
The Option Exercise Price to be paid by the Company to the Star Equity Holders will consist of $3,000,000 in cash, a promissory note in
the principal amount of $3,000,000, which shall accrue interest at the rate of 8% and be due and payable six (6) months after the issuance
thereof, 2,385,170 shares of common stock of the Company and a five-year warrant to purchase 5,109,789 shares of the Company’s common
stock for an exercise price of $1.50 per share. On May 13, 2025, the parties entered into Amendment No. 2 increasing the amount that the Company will lend to
Star prior to the closing date from $1,800,000 to $3,000,000 and removing the closing condition that a fairness opinion be delivered at
closing. Star also executed a promissory note memorializing the previous $2,000,000 funded by the Company as well as future advances to
be provided to Star up to a total of $3,000,000.

If, for a period of 12 months
after the closing, the Company’s shares of common stock are delisted from Nasdaq, Star shall have the right, at its own discretion,
to require the Company to exchange the Investment Note for all the shares of Star then held by the Company, provided, however, the Option
shall be automatically cancelled and Star shall retain any cash payments made by the Company to Star and the Company shall retain an equity
interest in Star equivalent to all cash payments.

Subject to the closing of the acquisition of Star,
our business will be focused on the defense sector.

Recent Developments

Amendments to Star Agreement

On June 15, 2025, the
parties entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Star Agreement whereby they clarified that if the Company fails to make all payments by
the agreed time or if the Star Agreement is terminated as a result of the Company failing to perform or observe the covenants or
agreements of the Company or if Company fails to maintain its listing on Nasdaq, Star shall be entitled to a payment from the
Company in the amount of $3,000,000.

On July 25, 2025, the Company
entered into Amendment No. 4 to the Star Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of Amendment No. 4, Menachem Shalom, the holder of all Class
B common stock of Star, agreed that all said shares shall be converted to Class A common stock of Star. The objective of such cancellation
and conversion is to eliminate the disparity between the voting rights and the economic rights of the common stock of Star.

Darwin Labs Warrants

On July 30, 2025 the Company
entered into a warrant agreement with Synthetic Darwin LLC (“Darwin”), enabling the Company to acquire up to 200 million Darwin
tokens, a new class of self-evolving AI network tokens developed by Darwin. Darwin is a self-training and evolving AI that can be
used to test and simulate multiple scenarios in finance, healthcare and defense. This software aims to allow companies to run scenarios
and find the best configuration for financial services, drugs, defense-related software and more. The Company has identified the potential
in such AI software and decided to enter into this warrant agreement for Darwin tokens, which will allow the Company and the Company’s
future subsidiaries to use this platform.

Comparison For
the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2025 Versus the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2024

Revenue

We had no revenue from continuing
operations during the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, due to the discontinuation of subsidiary DRFQ’s operations
since DRFQ has been classified as held-for-sale. We expect to report revenue upon the closing of the Star acquisition, which we expect
to be complete by and near the end of the third quarter of this year. At this time, the Company does not expect to generate revenue from
other sources prior to the closing of the Star acquisition.

Operating Expenses

Professional fees

For the three months ended
June 30, 2025, professional fees decreased by approximately $144,000, or 16.3%, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. For
the six months ended June 30, 2025, professional fees decreased by approximately $1,022,000, or 37.6%. This decrease was primarily attributable
to a decrease in advisory service fees of $965,500 and consulting fees of approximately $310,000, offset by an increase in legal fees
of approximately $123,000 and audit fees of approximately $131,000. This net decrease in professional fees is mainly attributable to the
one-time costs incurred in early 2024 in relation to the business combination. We expect that our professional fees will remain consistent
in the near future with a possible marginal increase between now and the closing of the Star acquisition. Subsequent to the closing of
the Star acquisition, we expect professional fees to decrease slightly as we anticipate the frequency of one-time costs of professional
fees to come down.

32

Compensation and related benefits

For the three months ended
June 30, 2025, our compensation and related benefits increased by approximately $46,000, or 186.0%, as compared to the three months ended
June 30, 2024. For the six months ended June 30, 2025, our compensation and related benefits increased by approximately $80,000, or 145.5%,
as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2024. We expect that our compensation and related benefits will increase in the near future
if the pending acquisition of Star completes during fiscal year 2025, as the Company expects to employ several individuals immediately
following the closing of the acquisition. Our compensation and related benefits have been significantly lower than our professional fees
due to the engagement of several professionals working for the Company on a consulting basis.

Other general and administrative expenses

For the three months ended
June 30, 2025, total other general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $116,000, or 95.1%, as compared to the three
months ended June 30, 2024. For the six months ended June 30, 2025, total other general and administrative expenses increased by approximately
$382,000, or 110.6%, as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2024. The increase was mainly attributable to additional costs associated
with operating as a public company, including an increase in D&O insurance of approximately $168,000, marketing fees of approximately
$110,000, rent expenses of approximately $73,000 attributable to new offices established in Israel and New York, entertainment and travel
of approximately $89,000 attributable to the travel by our CEO and other business expenses of approximately $93,000, offset by a decrease
in filing fees of approximately $150,000. We expect that other general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in the near
future if the pending acquisition of Star completes during fiscal year 2025, as the Company expects to incur higher costs such as insurance,
rent, advertising, and travel expenses.

Other Income (Expense)

For the three months ended June 30, 2025, other income (expense), net,
increased approximately $4,514,000, or 1,972.6%, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. For the six months ended June 30,
2025, other income (expense), net, increased approximately $109,172,000, or 45,707.6%, as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2024.
The increase was attributable to, an increase in gain from change in fair value – stock purchase warrant liabilities of approximately
$109,406,000, a gain from change in fair value – convertible note embedded derivative of approximately $588,000, realized and unrealized
gains of approximately $146,000, and a decrease in loss on debt settlement of approximately $176,000, offset by an increase in penalties
– late registration, payable to the investor in connection with the December 2024 Private Placement, of $800,000, interest expense
due to amortization of debt discounts of approximately $279,000, and interest expense on debt of approximately $81,000. The significant
changes in fair value recognized on the Company’s stock purchase warrant liabilities are directly related to several warrants granted
during fiscal year 2024. For the duration of the life of these warrants, the Company expects to continue to recognize significant gains
or losses heavily driven by any changes in the Company’s stock price at each quarterly and annual report date.

Discontinued Operations

Net loss from discontinued
operations was estimated to be $217,952 for the three months ended June 30, 2025 compared to $358,045 for the three
months ended June 30, 2024. Net loss from discontinued operations was estimated to be $400,707 for the six months ended June 30, 2025
compared to $692,261 for the six months ended June 30, 2024. These decreases were due to a decrease in net loss from the operations of
the Company’s wholly owed subsidiary DRFQ, which is the sole driver of the Company’s former financial services segment. The
Company expects to recognize a deconsolidation of DRFQ in the third quarter due to the sale of this subsidiary, which will cease discontinued
operations of the Company.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We generated a pre-tax net
income from continuing operations of $106,377,435 for the six months ended June 30, 2025 and incurred a pre-tax net loss from continuing
operations of $3,353,397 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, and have an accumulated deficit of $95,099,015 as of June 30,
2025 and $201,075,743 at December 31, 2024. As of June 30, 2025, we had a working capital deficit of $53,463,528, including $1,519,647
of cash. The pre-tax net income from continuing operations of approximately $106,000,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2025 is primarily
due to the applicable accounting treatment used to recognize gains from changes in fair value of liability-classified warrants which does
not impact our cash position. During the six months ended June 30, 2025 the most significant use of the Company’s cash was for the
purpose of advance cash payments to Star of $1,500,000 pursuant to the amended terms of the Star transaction. The Company intends to make
an additional final advance payment of $500,000 subsequent to June 30, 2025.

We have not been able to generate
sufficient cash from operating activities to fund our ongoing operations. However, we expect to generate revenue beginning immediately
after the closing of the Star acquisition, which we expect to be completed near the end of the third quarter of 2025. Since our inception,
we have raised capital through private sales of common stock and debt securities. Our future success is dependent upon our ability to
achieve profitable operations and generate cash from operating activities. There is no guarantee that we will be able to generate enough
revenue and/or raise capital to support our operations.

To the extent that current
and anticipated future sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our future business activities and cash and other requirements, we
may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. The sale of additional equity would result in additional dilution to our
stockholders. The incurrence of additional debt financing would result in debt service obligations and the instruments governing such
debt could provide for operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. Even if debt financing is available, the
cost of additional financing may be significantly higher than our current debt.

33

The risks and uncertainties
surrounding the Company’s ability to continue to raise capital and its limited capital resources raise substantial doubt as to the
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months from the issuance of these consolidated financial statements.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America, which contemplate our continuation as a going concern.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We had no outstanding derivative
financial instruments, off-balance sheet guarantees, interest rate swap transactions or foreign currency contracts. We do not engage in
trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.

Critical Accounting Estimates

Our consolidated financial
statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation
of consolidated financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenue, costs, and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions
that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from our estimates. To the extent
that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition,
operating results, and cash flows will be affected.

See Note 3. Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies of the Notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q for a summary of significant accounting policies and significant estimates and assumptions and their effects on our financial statements.
Below are the significant estimates and assumptions that we consider critical because they involve a significant amount of estimation
uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

Discontinued Operations

As discussed in Note 4 to the unaudited financial statements in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company was unable to obtain complete financial information from a subsidiary for the three months
ended June 30, 2025. Consequently, management relied on historical trends and partial records to estimate the operating results of the
discontinued operations for the three months ended June 30, 2025.

The inability to verify actual results introduces a level of uncertainty
into the reported net loss from discontinued operations. Management continues to monitor the situation and may adjust its estimates in
future filings should additional information become available.

Stock-based Compensation

We account for share-based
payments that involve the issuance of shares of our common stock to employees and nonemployees and meet the criteria for share-based awards
as stock-based compensation expense based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The Company has elected to recognize the adjustment
to stock-based compensation expense in the period in which forfeitures occur. We recognize compensation expense for awards with only service
conditions on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.

If factors change, and we
utilize different assumptions including the probability of achieving performance conditions, share-based compensation cost on future
award grants may differ significantly from share-based compensation cost recognized on past award grants. If there are any modifications
or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities, we may be required to accelerate any remaining unearned share-based compensation
cost or incur incremental cost. Share-based compensation cost affects our compensation and benefits expenses.

Warrants

Classification:
 The
Company determines the accounting classification of warrants it issues as either liability or equity classified by first assessing whether
the warrants meet liability classification in accordance with ASC 480-10, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics
of both Liabilities and Equity (“ASC 480”), then in accordance with ASC 815-40 (“ASC 815”), Accounting for Derivative
Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own Stock. Under ASC 480, warrants are considered liability
classified if the warrants are mandatorily redeemable, obligate the Company to settle the warrants or the underlying shares by paying
cash or other assets, or warrants that must or may require settlement by issuing variable number of shares. If warrants do not meet liability
classification under ASC 480, the Company assesses the requirements under ASC 815, which states that contracts that require or may require
the issuer to settle the contract for cash are liabilities recorded at fair value, irrespective of the likelihood of the transaction occurring
that triggers the net cash settlement feature. If the warrants do not require liability classification under ASC 815, and in order to
conclude equity classification, the Company also assesses whether the warrants are indexed to its Common Stock and whether the warrants
are classified as equity under ASC 815 or other applicable GAAP. After all relevant assessments, the Company concludes whether the warrants
are classified as liability or equity. Liability classified warrants require fair value accounting at issuance and subsequent to initial
issuance with all changes in fair value after the issuance date recorded in the statements of operations. Equity classified warrants only
require fair value accounting at issuance with no changes recognized subsequent to the issuance date.

35

We assess the classification
of our stock purchase warrants at each reporting date to determine whether a change in classification between equity and liability is
required. For modified stock purchase warrants that result in a change of classification from equity to liability, a liability is recognized
equal to the fair value on the date of modification, additional paid-in capital is adjusted by the fair value of the warrant on the date
of issuance, and the difference is recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive
loss.

Valuation:
 The fair
value of our equity-classified stock purchase warrants and liability-classified stock purchase warrants are determined utilizing Level
3 inputs using a Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model and a Monte Carlo simulation model, respectively.

In both models, the fair value
of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of measurement as well as other assumptions, including the estimated volatility
of our stock price over the term of the stock purchase warrant as of the measurement date and the estimated period of time that we expect
third parties to hold the stock purchase warrants at the measurement date. The risk-free interest rate assumption we use is based upon
United States Treasury interest rates appropriate for the expected life of the stock purchase warrant.

As our stock has limited trading
history on NASDAQ, we use the historical volatility of our peer companies in order to estimate future stock price trends. We expect third
parties to hold their stock purchase warrants for the contractual term as we do not have any history to support a shorter term and do
not anticipate stock purchase warrants to be exercised prior to the end of the term. Our expected dividend rate is zero since we do not
currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future.

We use the Monte Carlo simulation
model for our liability-classified stock purchase warrants in order to incorporate other subjective assumptions based on the terms of
the specific stock purchase warrant agreements or the related host contract. For our liability-classified stock purchase warrants as of
June 30, 2025, we included the probability of a fundamental event, as defined in the relevant agreements, occurring in our assumptions.

The aforementioned inputs
entered into the models we use to fair value our stock purchase warrants are subjective estimates and changes to these estimates will
cause the fair value of our stock purchase warrants and related debt issuance discount we recognize to vary.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Classification:
 We
evaluate our financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded
derivatives in accordance with ASC 815. Derivative instruments are initially recorded at fair value on the grant date and re-valued
at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss included
in this Report under “Item 8. Financial Statements”. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such
instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. Derivative liabilities
are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement or conversion of the instrument
could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date. Bifurcated embedded derivatives are classified with the related host contract
on the Company’s balance sheet.

36

Valuation:
 We use the
Monte Carlo simulation model for our bifurcated embedded derivatives in order to incorporate subjective assumptions based on the terms
of the specific host contracts. For our bifurcated embedded derivatives issued in connection with our December 2024 convertible note payable,
we included the probability of a fundamental event, as defined in the relevant agreements, occurring in our assumptions in addition to
the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the bifurcated embedded derivative as of the measurement date, the remaining
term of the host contract at the measurement date, the risk-free interest rate based upon United States Treasury interest rates appropriate
for the expected term, the conversion discount, and the redemption premium.

Legal and other contingencies 

We are subject to various
legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain, and such uncertainty
may be enhanced due to the industry in which we operate. We record a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the
amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. In addition, we record recoveries of these losses
when it is probable that they will be collected. These estimates are highly sensitive to change and involve variables that are not completely
within our control nor practicable to model, including decisions made by regulators and settlement negotiations. Resolution of legal and
other contingencies in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on our financial condition
and results of operations.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

For information about recently
issued accounting standards, refer to Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements appearing elsewhere in this report.

Foreign Currency Risk

Foreign currency transaction risk

Revenues, expenses, and financial
results of our foreign subsidiaries are recorded in the functional currency of these subsidiaries. Our foreign currency exposure is primarily
related to transactions denominated in British Pounds attributable to cash, customer custodial funds and customer custodial cash liabilities
and intercompany transactions where the transaction currency is different from a subsidiary’s functional currency. Changes in foreign
exchange rates, and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our results of operations
as expressed in U.S. dollars. We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our results of operations as a result
of gains or losses on the settlement and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are
not the functional currency of the respective entity.

If an adverse 10% foreign
currency exchange rate change was applied to the largest foreign currency exposure (e.g. British Pound) or to all foreign currency exposures
in aggregate, of monetary assets, liabilities, and commitments denominated in currencies other than its functional currency as of June
30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, it would not have a material impact on our financial results.

From time to time, we may
enter into derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. It is difficult
to predict the impact hedging activities would have on our results of operations. Additionally, the volatility of exchange rates depends
on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy. Our international operations increase our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations
and, as a result, such fluctuations could have a material impact on our future results of operations and cash flows.

37

Fluctuations in functional
currencies from our net investment in international subsidiaries expose us to foreign currency translation risk, where changes in foreign
currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations upon translation into U.S. dollars. See the consolidated statements
of comprehensive income (loss) in Part II, Item 8 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for translation adjustments for the three and
six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, a 10% increase or decrease in foreign currency exchange rates used in translating the financial
statements of subsidiaries with functional currencies other than our reporting currency would not have a material impact on our financial
results.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk

We are a smaller reporting
company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls

Our management conducted
an evaluation, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer, who is also its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a—15(e) and 15d—15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(the “Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation,
the Chief Executive Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in reporting, on a timely basis,
information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act, because of material weaknesses in
internal control over financial reporting as of June, 2025, as described below.

Plan of Remediation
of Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Following the identification
and communication of the material weakness described above, management commenced remediation actions relating to this material weakness
beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, as follows:

●

We are utilizing the services of external consultants for non-routine and/or technical accounting issues as they arise.

●

We are expanding and improving our review process for complex accounting transactions. We plan to further improve this process by enhancing access to accounting literature, identification of third-party professionals with whom to consult regarding complex accounting applications and consideration of additional staff with the requisite experience and training to supplement existing accounting professionals.

●

We are implementing enhancements and process improvements, including the design and implementation of well-defined controls and related control attributes
.

38

The material weaknesses
identified above will not be considered fully remediated until these additional controls and procedures have operated effectively
for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are effective. Our management will
monitor the effectiveness of our remediation plans and will make changes management determines to be appropriate. If not remediated,
these material weaknesses could result in material misstatements to our annual or interim consolidated financial statements that may not
be prevented or detected on a timely basis or result in a delayed filing of required periodic reports. If we are unable to assert that
our internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial
reports, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected, and we could become subject to litigation or investigations
by Nasdaq, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.

Notwithstanding the above,
management believes that the consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, fairly present, in all
material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles.

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls

A control system, no
matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system
are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resources constraints, and the benefits of controls
must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can
provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. These inherent
limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error
or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or
by management override of the control.

The design of any system
of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can only be reasonable assurance
that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, control may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent
limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

Changes in Internal
Control over Financial Reporting.

There were no changes
in our internal control over financial reporting, known to the Chief Executive Officer that occurred during the period covered by this
report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

39

Part II - Other Information

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

From time to time, we are
subject to ordinary routine litigation incidental to our normal business operations. We are not currently a party to any material legal
proceedings.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

Risk factors that affect our
business and financial results are discussed in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors,” in our Annual Report on Form 10-KT for the
period ended December 31, 2024 as filed with the SEC on May 8, 2025, as amended July 9, 2025 (“Annual Report”). There have been no material changes
in our risk factors from those previously disclosed in our Annual Report. You should carefully consider the risks described in our Annual
Report which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in our Annual Report are
not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also
may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or operating results. If any of the risks actually occur, our business,
financial condition, and/or results of operations could be negatively affected.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
and Use of Proceeds.

Except as set forth below,
there were no sales of equity securities sold during the period covered by this Report that were not registered under the Securities Act
and were not previously reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company.

On April 4, 2025, the Company
entered into a settlement agreement with a former consultant of the Company. Pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement, the Company
issued 12,500 shares of common stock to the consultant.

On May 13, 2025, a
consultant submitted a cashless exercise of 100,000 options granted in November 2024, which resulted in an issuance of 84,276 shares of common
stock.

During the three months
ended June 30, 2025, YA II PN, LTD. converted all principal and accrued interest on the $500,000 note issued
December 3, 2024 for 260,300 shares of common stock.

The above issuance[s] did
not involve any underwriters, underwriting discounts or commissions, or any public offering and we believe are exempt from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, by virtue of Section 4(a)(2) thereof.

Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities

None.

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures

Not Applicable.

Item 5. Other Information

During the quarter ended June
30, 2025, no director or officer 
adopted
 or 
terminated
 (i) any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase
or sale of securities of the Company intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or (ii) any “non-Rule
10b5-1 trading arrangement” as defined in paragraph (c) of item 408 of Regulation S-K.

On November 8, 2024, the Company,
Jamal Khurshid and Match Financial Limited (“Match Financial”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company entered a settlement
agreement. This agreement contemplated the sale of Match Financial’s shares in Digital RFQ Limited (“DRFQ”) to Mr. Khurshid
subject to the Company obtaining shareholder approval.

Match Financial, incorporated
on March 6, 2019, operates as a holding company and is the sole shareholder of DRFQ, an FCA-registered electronic money directive agent
specializing in cross-border digital payments utilizing blockchain technology. The Company acquired Match Financial in 2021 as part of
its strategy to expand in the financial technology and cryptocurrency sectors. Match Financial holds minimal assets beyond its investment
in DRFQ.

On August 5, 2025, the Company
was notified that on July 29, 2025, Match Financial was placed into administration in the United Kingdom pursuant to the Insolvency Act
1986 resulting in the appointment of two administrators (the “Administrators”). The administration was initiated by the sole
director of Match Financial, Jamal Khurshid. According to the notice sent to the Company, on July 29, 2025, the Administrators completed
a pre-packaged sale of Match Financial’s entire shareholding in DRFQ to Match Financial Holdings Limited, a newly formed entity owned
by Mr. Khurshid, for nominal consideration of £102,000. The transaction results in the divestiture of DRFQ.

The Company does not expect
the administration of Match Financial to have a material adverse impact on its consolidated financial position or operations, as Match
Financial contributed negligible revenue and assets to the Company.

The Company continues to pursue its defense business related initiatives.
The Company is presently seeking shareholder approval of the Securities Purchase Agreement and Call Option (the “Star Agreement”)
with Star 26 Capital Inc. (“Star”) initially entered in December 2024 with the shareholders of Star (“Star Equity Holders”)
and an officer of the Company, acting in his capacity as the representative of the Star Equity Holders, to acquire a controlling 51% interest
in Star, a Nevada Corporation, owning 100% or Rimon, an Israeli corporation engaged as a supplier of generators for “iron dome”
launchers and other defense products.

On August 11, 2025, the Company
entered into a settlement agreement with the current holder (the “Holder”) of the August 2024 Note and August 2024 Warrant.
Pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement, the Holder agreed to waive all events of default in relation to the August 2024 Note.
Additionally, the Holder agreed to convert the August 2024 Note into 243,155 shares of common stock based on the post-reverse stock split
conversion price of $2.50 per share. In consideration of such waiver and conversion, the Company agreed to issue to the Holder a pre-funded
warrant to purchase 1,702,088 shares of the Company’s common stock. Furthermore, on August 11, 2025, the Company agreed to exchange
the August 2024 Warrant for a new warrant (the “Exchange Warrant”) in form and substance similar to the August 2024 Warrant,
provided that such Exchange Warrant permitted the Holder to exercise such Exchange Warrant on a cashless basis. The Holder then exercised
the Exchange Warrant on a cashless basis, resulting in an issuance of 123,860 shares of the Company’s common stock.
