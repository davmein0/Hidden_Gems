ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
We are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, investigations, disputes, and claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. Many of these actions raise complex factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties. Such matters from time to time include commercial, intellectual property, customer, consumer, and employment proceedings, including class action lawsuits. The plaintiffs and government authorities in some actions may seek unspecified damages, injunctive relief, penalties and cost reimbursement. Actions are in various procedural stages, and some are covered in part by insurance. We cannot predict with assurance the outcome of actions brought against us. Accordingly, adverse developments, settlements, or resolutions may occur and negatively impact income in the quarter of such development, settlement or resolution. If a potential loss arising from these lawsuits, claims and pending actions is probable and reasonably estimable, we record the estimated liability based on circumstances and assumptions existing at the time. Although the outcome of these and other claims cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

Securities Class Action Proceedings
On August 1, 2024, a putative class action was filed against Five Below, Inc. and a certain former senior officer in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, purportedly on behalf of a class of the Company's investors who purchased or otherwise acquired our publicly traded securities between March 20, 2024 and July 16, 2024. On September 16, 2024, a similar action was commenced against Five Below, Inc. in the same court on behalf of a class of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired our publicly traded securities between December 1, 2022 and July 16, 2024. The complaints allege violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder in connection with various public statements made by us. On October 28, 2024, the court entered an order consolidating the actions and appointing lead plaintiff. Lead plaintiff filed its Consolidated Amended Complaint against the Company and one former senior officer and one current senior officer on January 13, 2025. Defendants filed their motion to dismiss the Consolidated Amended Complaint on March 14, 2025. Lead plaintiff’s opposition to defendants’ motion to dismiss is due on or before May 13, 2025, and any reply in support of defendants’ motion to dismiss is due on or before July 11, 2025.  The Company intends to vigorously defend against this action, which the Company believes to be without merit. The potential impact of this action, which seeks unspecified damages, attorneys’ fees and expenses, is uncertain.

Overview
Five Below, Inc. (collectively referred to herein with its wholly owned subsidiaries as "we," "us," or "our") is a rapidly growing specialty value retailer offering a broad range of trend-right, high-quality merchandise targeted at the tween and teen customer. We offer a dynamic, edited assortment of exciting products, with most priced at $5 and below, including select brands and licensed merchandise across our category worlds. In fiscal 2019, we rolled out new pricing to our full chain, increasing prices on certain products over $5. Most of our products remain at $5 and below. As of February 1, 2025, we operated 1,771 stores in 44 states.
We also offer our merchandise on the internet, through our fivebelow.com e-commerce website and mobile app, offering home delivery and the option to buy online and pick up in store. Additionally, we sell merchandise through on-demand third-party delivery services to enable our customers to shop online and receive convenient delivery. All e-commerce sales, which includes shipping and handling revenue, are included in net sales and are included in comparable sales. Our e-commerce expenses will have components classified as both cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expenses (including depreciation and amortization).
We believe that our business model has resulted in strong financial performance when considered in light of the economic environment. Our comparable sales decreased by 2.7% in fiscal 2024, increased by 2.8% in fiscal 2023, and decreased by 2.0% in fiscal 2022. We expanded our store base from 1,340 stores at the end of fiscal 2022 to 1,771 stores at the end of fiscal 2024 and we plan to open approximately 150 new stores in fiscal 2025. Between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2024, our net sales increased from $3,076.3 million to $3,876.5 million, representing a compounded annual growth rate of 12.3%. Over the same period, our operating income decreased from $345.0 million to $323.8 million.
We expect to continue our strong growth in the future. By offering trend-right merchandise at differentiated price points, our stores have been successful in varying geographic regions, population densities and real estate settings. As of February 1, 2025, we operated stores in 44 states throughout the United States. We are primarily located in power, community and lifestyle shopping centers across a variety of urban, suburban and semi-rural markets with trade areas including at least 100,000 people in the specified market. We continue to believe we have the opportunity to expand our store base in the United States from 1,771 locations as of February 1, 2025 to more than 3,500 locations over time. Our ability to open profitable new stores depends on many factors, including our ability to identify suitable markets and sites; negotiate leases with acceptable terms; achieve brand awareness in the new markets; efficiently source and distribute additional merchandise; and achieve sufficient levels of cash flow and financing to support our expansion. 
We have a proven and profitable store model that has produced consistent financial results and returns, and our new stores have achieved average payback period of approximately one year. Our new store model assumes a store size of approximately 9,500 square feet that achieves annual sales of approximately $2 million in the first full year of operation. Our new store model also assumes an average new store investment of approximately $0.4 million. Our new store investment includes our store build-out (net of tenant allowances), inventory (net of payables) and cash pre-opening expenses.
38
Our planned store expansion will place increased demands on our operational, managerial, administrative and other resources. Managing our growth effectively will require us to continue to maintain adequate distribution capacity, enhance our store management systems, financial and management controls, information systems and other operational system capabilities. In addition, we will be required to hire, train and retain store management and other qualified personnel. For further information, see Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors-Risk Relating to our Business and Industry.”
We have invested a significant amount of capital in infrastructure and systems necessary to support our future growth and we expect to incur additional capital expenditures to expand, upgrade, and develop our infrastructure and systems in future periods. In fiscal 2024, we invested in a new ERP, Oracle Fusion, which is designed to enhance functionality and provide timely information to our management team related to the operation of the business. In fiscal 2021, we invested in a new enterprise wide human capital management system which is designed to manage our workforce by providing a comprehensive suite of tools for human resources, talent management, payroll, time tracking, benefits administration and workforce planning. In fiscal 2020, we launched our e-commerce website and invested in a new Retail Merchandising System, which is designed to manage, control, and perform seamless execution of day-to-day merchandising activities, including purchasing, distribution, order fulfillment, and financial close. In fiscal 2015, we opened a shipcenter in Pedricktown, New Jersey and currently occupy approximately 1,000,000 square feet, having expanded from 800,000 square feet in September 2018. In fiscal 2016, we signed a 15-year lease for a new corporate headquarters location in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and currently occupy approximately 230,000 square feet of office space. In March 2019, we completed the purchase of an approximately 700,000 square foot shipcenter in Forsyth, Georgia for approximately $42 million, and currently occupy approximately 1,100,000 square feet after expanding in the first half of 2024. In August 2019, we acquired land in Conroe, Texas, to build an approximately 860,000 square foot shipcenter for approximately $56 million. In July 2020, we acquired land in Buckeye, Arizona, to build an approximately 860,000 square foot shipcenter for approximately $65 million, and currently occupy approximately 1,200,000 square feet after expanding in the second half of 2024. In March 2021, we acquired land in Indianapolis, Indiana, to build an approximately 1,030,000 square foot shipcenter for approximately $60 million.
We continuously assess ways to maximize the productivity and efficiency of our existing facilities, infrastructure and systems. The timing and amount of investments in our facilities, infrastructure and systems could affect the comparability of our results of operations in future periods. The completion date and ultimate cost of future projects could differ significantly from initial expectations due to construction-related or other reasons.
We believe our business strategy will continue to offer significant opportunity, but it also presents risks and challenges. These risks and challenges include, but are not limited to, that we may not be able to effectively identify and respond to changing trends and customer preferences, that we may not be able to find desirable locations for new stores and that we may not be able to effectively manage our future growth. In addition, our financial results can be expected to be directly impacted by substantial increases in product costs due to commodity cost increases or general inflation which could lead to a reduction in our sales as well as greater margin pressure as costs may not be able to be passed on to consumers. To date, changes in commodity prices and general inflation have not materially impacted our business. In response to increasing commodity prices or general inflation, we seek to minimize the impact of such events by sourcing our merchandise from different vendors and changing our product mix. See Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” for a description of these and other important factors that could adversely impact us and our results of operations.
How We Assess the Performance of Our Business and Non-GAAP Measures
In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. These key measures include net sales, comparable sales, cost of goods sold and gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses (including depreciation and amortization) and operating income.
Net Sales
Net sales constitute gross sales net of merchandise returns for damaged or defective goods. Net sales consist of sales from comparable stores, non-comparable stores, and e-commerce, which includes shipping and handling revenue. Revenue from the sale of gift cards is deferred and not included in net sales until the gift cards are redeemed to purchase merchandise or as breakage revenue in proportion to the pattern of redemption of the gift cards by the customer.
Our business is seasonal and as a result, our net sales fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Net sales are usually highest in the fourth fiscal quarter due to the year-end holiday season.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales include net sales from stores that have been open for at least 15 full months from their opening date, and e-commerce sales. Comparable stores include the following:
•
Stores that have been remodeled while remaining open;
39
•
Stores that have been relocated within the same trade area, to a location that is not significantly different in size, in which the new store opens at about the same time as the old store closes; and
•
Stores that have expanded, but are not significantly different in size, within their current locations.
For stores that are relocated or expanded, the following periods are excluded when calculating comparable sales:
•
The period beginning when the closing store receives its last merchandise delivery from one of our shipcenters through: 
▪
the last day of the fiscal year in which the store was relocated or expanded (for stores that increased significantly in size); or
▪
the last day of the fiscal month in which the store re-opens (for all other stores); and
•
The period beginning on the first anniversary of the date the store received its last merchandise delivery from one of our shipcenters through the period ending on the first anniversary of the date the store re-opened.
Comparable sales exclude the 53rd week of sales for 53-week fiscal years. In the 52-week fiscal year subsequent to a 53-week fiscal year, we exclude the sales in the non-comparable week from the same-store sales calculation. Due to the 53rd week in fiscal 2023, comparable sales for the year ended February 1, 2025 are reported on a restated calendar basis. Reference to the "restated calendar” is based on using the National Retail Federation's restated calendar comparing similar weeks, which are the fifty-two weeks from February 4, 2024 to February 1, 2025 as compared to the fifty-two weeks from February 5, 2023 to February 3, 2024.
There may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable or “same store” sales. As a result, data in this Annual Report regarding our comparable sales may not be comparable to similar data made available by other retailers. Non-comparable sales are comprised of new store sales, sales for stores not open for a full 15 months, and sales from existing store relocation and expansion projects that were temporarily closed (or not receiving deliveries) and not included in comparable sales.
Measuring the change in fiscal year-over-year comparable sales allows us to evaluate how we are performing. Various factors affect comparable sales, including:
•
consumer preferences, buying trends and overall economic trends;
•
our ability to identify and respond effectively to customer preferences and trends;
•
our ability to provide an assortment of high-quality, trend-right and everyday product offerings that generate new and repeat visits to our stores;
•
the customer experience we provide in our stores and online;
•
the level of traffic near our locations in the power, community and lifestyle centers in which we operate;
•
competition;
•
changes in our merchandise mix;
•
pricing;
•
our ability to source and distribute products efficiently;
•
the timing of promotional events and holidays;
•
the timing of introduction of new merchandise and customer acceptance of new merchandise;
•
our opening of new stores in the vicinity of existing stores; 
•
the number of items purchased per store visit; and
•
weather conditions; and
•
the impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including closures of our stores, adverse impacts on our operations, and consumer sentiment regarding discretionary spending.
Opening new stores is an important part of our growth strategy. As we continue to pursue our growth strategy, we expect that a significant percentage of our net sales will continue to come from new stores not included in comparable sales. Accordingly, comparable sales are only one measure we use to assess the success of our growth strategy.
40
Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit
Gross profit is equal to our net sales less our cost of goods sold. Gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of our net sales. Cost of goods sold reflects the direct costs of purchased merchandise and inbound freight and tariffs, as well as shipping and handling costs, store occupancy, distribution and buying expenses. Shipping and handling costs include internal fulfillment and shipping costs related to our e-commerce operations. Store occupancy costs include rent, common area maintenance, utilities and property taxes for all store locations. Distribution costs include costs for receiving, processing, warehousing and shipping of merchandise from our shipcenters and between store locations. Buying costs include compensation expense and other costs for our internal buying organization, including our merchandising and product development team and our planning and allocation group. These costs are significant and can be expected to continue to increase as our Company grows.
The components of our cost of goods sold may not be comparable to the components of cost of goods sold or similar measures of our competitors and other retailers. As a result, data in this Annual Report regarding our gross profit and gross margin may not be comparable to similar data made available by our competitors and other retailers.
The variable component of our cost of goods sold is higher in higher volume quarters because the variable component of our cost of goods sold generally increases as net sales increase. We regularly analyze the components of gross profit, a non-GAAP financial measure, as well as gross margin as it provides a useful and relevant measure to analyze our financial performance. Any inability to obtain acceptable levels of initial markups, a significant increase in our use of markdowns, and a significant increase in inventory shrinkage or inability to generate sufficient sales leverage on the store occupancy, distribution and buying components of cost of goods sold could have an adverse impact on our gross profit and results of operations. In addition, current global supply chain disruptions, the cost of freight and constraints on shipping capacity to transport inventory may have an adverse impact on our gross profit and results of operations, as well as our sales. Changes in the mix of our products may also impact our overall cost of goods sold.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (including Depreciation and Amortization)
Selling, general and administrative (including depreciation and amortization), or SG&A, expenses are composed of payroll and other compensation, marketing and advertising expense, depreciation and amortization expense and other selling and administrative expenses. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales are usually higher in lower sales volume quarters and lower in higher sales volume quarters.
The components of our SG&A expenses may not be comparable to those of other retailers. We expect that our SG&A expenses will increase in future periods due to our continuing store growth. Variability in performance-based compensation expense related to our business performance may cause SG&A expenses to be higher or lower than comparable periods. In addition, any increase in future share-based awards, modifications, or forfeitures will impact our share-based compensation expense included in SG&A expenses.
Operating Income
Operating income equals gross profit less SG&A expenses. Operating income excludes interest expense or income, other expense or income, and income tax expense or benefit. We use operating income as an indicator of the productivity of our business and our ability to manage SG&A expenses. Operating margin measures operating income as a percentage of our net sales.

Fiscal Year 2024 Compared to Fiscal Year 2023
Net Sales
Net sales increased to $3,876.5 million in fiscal year 2024 from $3,559.4 million in fiscal year 2023, an increase of $317.1 million, or 8.9%. The increase was the result of a non-comparable sales increase of $407.6 million, partially offset by a comparable sales decrease of $90.5 million. The increase in non-comparable sales was primarily driven by new stores that opened in fiscal 2024, and the number of stores that opened in fiscal 2023 but have not been open for 15 full months.
Comparable sales decreased 2.7%. This decrease resulted from a decrease of approximately 2.7% in the number of transactions.
42
Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit
Cost of goods sold increased to $2,523.9 million in fiscal year 2024 from $2,285.5 million in fiscal year 2023, an increase of $238.4 million, or 10.4%. The increase in cost of goods sold was primarily the result of an increase in the merchandise costs of goods resulting from an increase in net sales and included the impact of a non-recurring inventory write-off. Also contributing to the increase in costs of goods sold was an increase in store occupancy costs primarily resulting from new store openings.
Gross profit increased to $1,352.7 million in fiscal year 2024 from $1,273.8 million in fiscal year 2023, an increase of $78.9 million, or 6.2%. Gross margin decreased to 34.9% in fiscal year 2024 from 35.8% in fiscal year 2023, a decrease of approximately 90 basis points. The decrease in gross margin was primarily the result of an increase as a percentage of net sales in store occupancy costs, partially offset by a decrease as a percentage of net sales in distribution costs.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (including Depreciation and Amortization)
Selling, general and administrative expenses (including depreciation and amortization) increased to $1,028.8 million in fiscal year 2024 from $888.3 million in fiscal year 2023, an increase of $140.5 million, or 15.8%. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses (including depreciation and amortization) increased approximately 150 basis points to 26.5% in fiscal year 2024 compared to 25.0% in fiscal year 2023. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses (including depreciation and amortization) was the result of an increase of $126.1 million in store-related expenses primarily to support new store growth. Also contributing to the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses (including depreciation and amortization) was an increase of $14.4 million in corporate-related expenses, which included the impact of retention awards, partially offset by lower compensation expenses and the impact of a non-recurring stock compensation benefit.
Income Tax Expense
Income tax expense decreased to $85.1 million in fiscal year 2024 from $100.0 million in fiscal year 2023, a decrease of $14.9 million, or 14.9%. The decrease in income tax expense was primarily due to a $62.4 million decrease in pre-tax net income and non-deductible expenses, partially offset by discrete items, which includes the impact of share-based accounting.
Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2024 was 25.1% compared to 24.9% in fiscal year 2023. The increase in our effective tax rate was primarily driven by discrete items, which includes the impact of share-based accounting, partially offset by non-deductible expenses.
Net Income
As a result of the foregoing, net income decreased to $253.6 million in fiscal year 2024 from $301.1 million in fiscal year 2023, a decrease of approximately $47.5 million, or 15.8%. 
Seasonality
Our business is seasonal in nature with the highest level of net sales and net income generated in the fourth fiscal quarter due to the year-end holiday season and, therefore, operating results for any fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the full fiscal year. To prepare for the holiday season, we must order and keep in stock more merchandise than we carry during other parts of the year. We expect inventory levels, along with an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, generally to reach their highest levels in the third and fourth fiscal quarters in anticipation of the increased net sales during the year-end holiday season. As a result of this seasonality, and generally because of variation in consumer spending habits, we experience fluctuations in net sales, net income and working capital requirements during the year.
43
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
Cash capital expenditures typically vary depending on the timing of new store openings and infrastructure-related investments. We plan to make cash capital expenditures of approximately $210 million to $230 million in fiscal 2025, which exclude the impact of tenant allowances, and which we expect to fund from cash generated from operations, cash on-hand, investments and, as needed, borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. We expect to incur approximately $120 million of our cash capital expenditure budget in fiscal 2025 to construct and open approximately 150 new stores, with the remainder projected to be spent on our store relocations and remodels, corporate infrastructure and shipcenter facilities.
Our primary working capital requirements are for the purchase of store inventory and payment of payroll, rent, other store operating costs and distribution costs. Our working capital requirements fluctuate during the year, rising in the third and fourth fiscal quarters as we take title to increasing quantities of inventory in anticipation of our peak, year-end holiday shopping season in the fourth fiscal quarter. Fluctuations in working capital are also driven by the timing of new store openings. 
Historically, we have funded our capital expenditures and working capital requirements during the fiscal year with cash on hand, net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, which expires in September 2027, as needed, and we expect that funding to continue. When we have used our Revolving Credit Facility, the amount of indebtedness outstanding under it has tended to be the highest in the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. To the extent that we have drawn on the facility, we have paid down the borrowings before the end of the fiscal year with cash generated during our peak selling season in the fourth quarter. As of February 1, 2025, we did not have any direct borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and had approximately $225 million available on the line of credit. 
On November 27, 2023, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program for up to $100 million of our common stock through November 27, 2026. In fiscal 2024, we purchased 266,997 shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $40.0 million, or average price of $149.79 per share.
Since approval of the share repurchase program in March 2018, we have purchased approximately 1.9 million shares for an aggregate cost of approximately $270 million. There can be no assurances that any additional repurchases will be completed, or as to the timing or amount of any repurchases. The share repurchase program may be modified or discontinued at any time. 
Based on our growth plans, we believe that our cash position which includes our cash equivalents and short-term investments, net cash provided by operating activities and availability under our Revolving Credit Facility, which expires in September 2027, will be adequate to finance our planned capital expenditures, authorized share repurchases and working capital requirements over the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter. If cash flows from operations and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility are not sufficient or available to meet our requirements, then we will be required to obtain additional equity or debt financing in the future. There can be no assurance that equity or debt financing will be available to us when we need it or, if available, that the terms will be satisfactory to us and not dilutive to our then-current shareholders.

Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2024 was $430.6 million, a decrease of $69.0 million compared to fiscal 2023. The decrease was primarily due to changes in working capital, a decrease in operating cash flows from store performance and an increase in income taxes paid.
44
Cash Used in Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2024 was $232.9 million, a decrease of $323.4 million compared to fiscal 2023. The decrease was primarily due an increase in net sales, maturities, and redemptions of investment securities and a decrease in capital expenditures.
Cash Used in Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities for fiscal year 2024 was $45.7 million, a decrease of $50.1 million compared to fiscal 2023. The decrease was primarily the result of decreases in the repurchase and retirement of common stock and common shares withheld for taxes.
Line of Credit

On September 16, 2022, we entered into a Second Amendment to Credit Agreement (the "Second Amendment") which amended the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of April 24, 2020, as previously amended by that certain First Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of January 27, 2021 (the "First Amendment"; the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement as amended by the First Amendment and the Second Amendment, the “Credit Agreement”), among the Company, 1616 Holdings, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ("1616 Holdings" and together with the Company, the "Loan Parties"), Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as administrative agent (the "Agent"), and other lenders party thereto (the "Lenders").
The Credit Agreement provides for a secured asset-based revolving line of credit in the amount of up to $225 million (the "Revolving Credit Facility"). Advances under the Revolving Credit Facility are tied to a borrowing base consisting of eligible credit card receivables and inventory, as reduced by certain reserves in effect from time to time. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, inventory appraisals and certain other diligence items are deferred, with reduced advance rates during the period that such appraisals have not been delivered. Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the Revolving Credit Facility expires on the earliest to occur of (i) September 16, 2027 or (ii) an event of default.
The Second Amendment also replaced the existing LIBOR (the "London Interbank Offered Rate") provisions with SOFR (the "Secured Overnight Financing Rate") provisions which converted then outstanding LIBOR loans into SOFR loans and additionally makes a number of other revisions to other provisions of the Credit Agreement. Giving effect to the Second Amendment, outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility would accrue interest at floating rates plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.12% to 1.50% for SOFR loans and 0.125% to 0.50% for base rate loans, and letter of credit fees range from 1.125% to 1.50%, in each case based on the average availability under the Revolving Credit Facility.  
The Revolving Credit Facility may be increased by up to an additional $150.0 million, subject to certain conditions, including obtaining commitments from one or more Lenders (the "Accordion"). Pursuant to the First Amendment, we obtained commitments from the Lenders that would allow us at our election (subject only to satisfaction of certain customary conditions such as the absence of any Event of Default), to increase the amount of the Revolving Credit Facility by an aggregate principal amount up to $50 million within the Accordion (the "Committed Increase"). The entire amount of the Revolving Credit Facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit and allows for swingline loans.  
The Credit Agreement contains customary covenants that limit, absent lender approval, the ability of the Company and certain of its affiliates to, among other things, pay cash dividends, incur debt, create liens and encumbrances, redeem or repurchase stock, enter into certain acquisition transactions with affiliates, merge, dissolve, repay certain indebtedness, change the nature of our business, enter sale or leaseback transactions, make investments or dispose of assets. In some cases, these restrictions are subject to certain negotiated exceptions or permit us to undertake otherwise restricted activities if it satisfies certain conditions. In addition, we will be required to maintain availability of not less than (i) 12.5% of the lesser of (x) aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility and (y) the borrowing base (the "loan cap") during the period that inventory appraisals have not been delivered as described above and (ii) at all other times 10.0% of the loan cap. 
If there exists an event of default or availability under the Revolving Credit Facility is less than 15% of the loan cap, amounts in any of the Loan Parties' or subsidiary guarantors' designated deposit accounts will be transferred daily into a blocked account held by the Agent and applied to reduce outstanding amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility (the "Cash Dominion Event"), so long as (i) such event of default has not been waived and/or (ii) until availability has exceeded 15% of the loan cap for sixty (60) consecutive calendar days (provided that such ability to discontinue the Cash Dominion Event shall be limited to two times during the term of the Credit Agreement). 
The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default including, among other things, failure to pay obligations when due, initiation of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, defaults on certain other indebtedness, change of control, incurrence of certain material judgments that are not stayed, satisfied, bonded or discharged within 30 days, certain ERISA events, invalidity of the credit documents, and violation of affirmative and negative covenants or breach of representations and warranties set forth in the Credit Agreement. Amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility may become due upon events of default (subject to any applicable grace or cure periods).  
45
All obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by 1616 Holdings and secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and 1616 Holdings. As of February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants applicable to us under the First Amendment and the Revolving Credit Facility.
As of February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024, we had approximately $225 million and $216 million, respectively, available in the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
We have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and understanding of our consolidated results of operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. Our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 in our annual consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Inventories
Inventories consist of finished goods purchased for resale, including freight and tariffs, and are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value, at the individual product level. Cost is determined on a weighted average cost method. The market value used in the lower of cost or market analysis is subject to the effects of consumer demands, customer preferences and the broader economy. The effects of the previously listed criteria are not controllable by management. Our management reviews inventory levels in order to identify obsolete and slow-moving merchandise as these factors can indicate a decline in the market value of inventory on hand. Inventory cost is reduced when the selling price less costs of disposal is below cost. We accrue an estimate for inventory shrink for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date. The shrink estimate can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shrink trends. These estimates are derived using available data and our historical experience. Our estimates may be impacted by changes in certain underlying assumptions and may not be indicative of future activity.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of which there are identifiable cash flows, which is generally at a store level. Assets are reviewed for impairment using factors including, but not limited to, our future operating plans and projected cash flows. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, then an impairment charge is recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Fair value is based on discounted future cash flows of the asset using a discount rate commensurate with the risk. In the event of a store closure, we will record an impairment charge, if appropriate, or accelerate depreciation over the revised useful life of the asset. Based on the analysis performed, our management believes that there was no impairment of long-lived assets for each of the 2024, 2023 and 2022 fiscal years. The impairment loss analysis requires management to apply judgment and make estimates.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset-and-liability method
.
 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.
46
We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when uncertainty regarding their realizability exists. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, our management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Our management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.

Our store leases generally have initial lease terms of 10 years and include renewal options on substantially the same terms and conditions as the original lease. Also included in operating leases are our leases for the corporate office, shipcenters and other.

Purchase obligations are primarily for materials that will be used in the construction of new stores and purchase commitments for infrastructure and systems that will be used by the corporate office and shipcenters. 
From February 2, 2025 to March 20, 2025, we committed to 13 new leases with terms of 10 years that have future minimum lease payments of approximately $24.0 million.
ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Interest Rate Risk
Our principal market risk relates to interest rate sensitivity, which is the risk that future changes in interest rates will reduce our net income or net assets. We have investment securities that are interest-bearing securities and if there are changes in interest rates, those changes would affect the interest income we earn on these investments and, therefore, impact our cash flows and results of operations. However, due to the short term nature of our investment portfolio, we do not believe an immediate 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio, and accordingly we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected by a sudden change in market interest rates.
We also have a Revolving Credit Facility which includes a revolving line of credit, which bears interest at a variable rate. Because our Revolving Credit Facility bears interest at a variable rate, we will be exposed to market risks relating to changes in interest rates, which could materially impact our consolidated statements of operations should we have any material borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. 
 As of February 1, 2025, we had approximatel
y
 $225 million available on the line of credit. The Credit Agreement provides that the interest rate payable on borrowings shall be, at the Company's option, a per annum rate equal to (a) a base rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.125% to 0.50% or (b) SOFR plus a margin ranging from 1.12% to 1.50%. Letter of credit fees range from 1.125% to 1.50%. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes, but this does not preclude our adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
Five Below, Inc.:
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Five Below, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended February 1, 2025, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended February 1, 2025, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of February 1, 2025, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated March 20, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.  
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Slow-moving and obsolete inventories at net realizable value
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company monitors inventory levels in order to identify slow-moving or obsolete merchandise as these factors can indicate a decline in the market value of the inventory on hand. The Company’s inventory balance was $660 million as of February 1, 2025. Inventory cost is reduced to net realizable value when cost exceeds the selling price less the cost of disposal. The market value is subject to the effects of consumer demands, customer preferences, and the broader economy. 
We identified the evaluation of slow-moving and obsolete inventories at net realizable value as a critical audit matter because a high degree of auditor judgment was required to evaluate the Company’s ability to sell certain products. 
49
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the critical audit matter. This included controls related to the review of historical product sales and inventory quantities on hand, and the estimate of net realizable value of slow-moving and obsolete inventories and adjustments of inventory cost to net realizable value. We evaluated the Company’s methodology for determining slow-moving and obsolete merchandise. We selected certain products determined to be slow-moving or obsolete and considered current market trends or seasonal impacts by assessing the nature of the slow-moving and obsolete merchandise. We assessed the Company’s adjustments of inventory costs to net realizable value for certain slow-moving and obsolete inventories by (1) comparing the historical estimate for net realizable value adjustments to actual adjustments of inventory costs, and (2) analyzing sales subsequent to the measurement date.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(1) 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
(a)
Description of Business
Five Below, Inc. (collectively referred to herein with its wholly-owned subsidiaries as the "Company") is a specialty value retailer offering merchandise targeted at the tween and teen demographic. The Company offers an edited assortment of products, with most priced at $
5
 and below. The Company’s edited assortment of products includes select brands and licensed merchandise. The Company believes its merchandise is readily available and that there are a number of potential vendors that could be utilized, if necessary, under approximately the same terms the Company is currently receiving; thus, it is not dependent on a single vendor or a group of vendors.
The Company is incorporated in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and, as of February 1, 2025, operated in 
44
 states excluding Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington. As of February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024, the Company operated 
1,771
 stores and 
1,544
 stores, respectively, each operating under the name “Five Below.” The Company also sells its merchandise on the internet, through the Company's fivebelow.com e-commerce website and mobile app, offering home delivery and the option to buy online and pick up in store. Additionally, the Company sells merchandise through on-demand third-party delivery service to enable our customers to shop online and receive convenient delivery. 
The Company's consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Five Below, Inc. and its subsidiaries (1616 Holdings, Inc., formerly known as Five Below Merchandising, Inc., 1616 Sourcing Holdco LLC and 1616 Holdings India Private Limited). All intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in the consolidation of the Company's and subsidiaries' financial statements.
(b)
Fiscal Year
The Company operates on a 52/53-week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to January 31. References to "fiscal year 2024" or "fiscal 2024" refer to the period from February 4, 2024 to February 1, 2025, which consists of a 52-week year. References to "fiscal year 2023" or "fiscal 2023" refer to the period from January 29, 2023 to February 3, 2024, which consists of a 53-week fiscal year. References to "fiscal year 2022" or "fiscal 2022" refer to the period from January 30, 2022 to January 28, 2023, which consists of a 52-week fiscal year.
(c)

Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with a maturity date of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Our cash equivalents consist of cash management solutions, credit and debit card receivables, money market funds, corporate bonds and municipal bonds with original maturities of 90 days or less, which are classified as cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The cash management solutions relate to cash deposit products that provide credit generally processed the next business day for cash deposited in third-party tech-enabled solutions. For credit card and debit card receivables, the majority of payments due from banks for third-party credit card and debit card transactions resulting from customer purchases at the Company’s retail stores process within 
24
 to 
48
 hours, except for transactions occurring on a Friday, which are generally processed the following Monday. Amounts due from banks for these transactions classified as cash equivalents totaled $
24.7
 million and $
22.4
 million as of February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024, respectively. Book overdrafts, which are outstanding checks in excess of funds on deposit, are recorded within accounts payable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and within operating activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. As of February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024, the Company had cash equivalents of $
310.4
 million and $
154.9
 million, respectively.
(d)
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified using the following hierarchy, which is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation at the measurement date: 
Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
Level 2: Inputs, other than Level 1, that are either directly or indirectly observable. 
Level 3: Unobservable inputs developed using the Company’s estimates and assumptions which reflect those that market participants would use. 
The classification of fair value measurements within the hierarchy are based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement. 
55
The Company’s financial instruments consist primarily of cash equivalents, investment securities, accounts payable, borrowings, if any, under a line of credit (as defined in note 5), equity method investments, and notes receivable. The Company believes that: (1) the carrying value of cash equivalents and accounts payable are representative of their respective fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments; and (2) the carrying value of the borrowings, if any, under the line of credit approximates fair value because the line of credit’s interest rates vary with market interest rates. Under the fair value hierarchy, the fair market values of cash equivalents and the investments in corporate bonds are Level 1 while the investments in municipal bonds are Level 2. The fair market values of Level 2 instruments are determined by management with the assistance of a third-party pricing service. Since quoted prices in active markets for identical assets are not available, these prices are determined by the third-party pricing service using observable market information such as quotes from less active markets and quoted prices of similar securities.
As of February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024, the Company's investment securities are classified as held-to-maturity since the Company has the intent and ability to hold the investments to maturity. 
Such securities are carried at amortized cost-plus accrued interest and consist of the following (in thousands):

Short-term investment securities as of February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024 all mature in one year or less. Long-term investment securities as of February 3, 2024 all mature after one year but in less than two years.
(e)
Inventories
Inventories consist of finished goods purchased for resale, including freight and tariffs, and are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value, at the individual product level. Cost is determined on a weighted average cost method. Management of the Company reviews inventory levels in order to identify slow-moving merchandise and uses markdowns to clear merchandise. Inventory cost is reduced when the selling price less costs of disposal is below cost. The Company accrues an estimate for inventory shrink for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date. The shrink estimate can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shrink trends.
(f)
Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets
Prepaid expenses in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 were $
37.7
 million and $
30.5
 million, respectively. Other current assets in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 were $
120.7
 million and $
123.5
 million, respectively.

(g)
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Additions and improvements are capitalized, while repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. 
56
Depreciation and amortization is recorded using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the terms of the respective leases, if applicable. The estimated useful lives are 
three
 to 
ten years
 for furniture and fixtures and computers and equipment. Store leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life or the lease term plus assumed extensions, which is generally 
ten years
. Leasehold improvements located in the shipcenters and the corporate headquarters are amortized over the shorter of the useful life or the lease term. Depreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment was $
167.4
 million, $
130.7
 million and $
105.6
 million in fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively.

(h)
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of which there are identifiable cash flows, which is generally at a store level. Assets are reviewed for impairment using factors including, but not limited to, the Company's future operating plans and projected cash flows. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, then an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Fair value is based on discounted future cash flows of the asset using a discount rate commensurate with the risk. In the event of a store closure, the Company will record an impairment charge, if appropriate, or accelerate depreciation over the revised useful life of the asset. Based on the Company's analysis performed in fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, management believes that no impairment of long-lived assets exists for the periods ended February 1, 2025, February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023.
(i)
Deferred Financing Costs
Deferred financing costs are amortized to interest expense over the term of the related credit agreement. As of February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024, the Company had $
0.4
 million and $
0.5
 million remaining in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets within Other Assets.

(j)
Operating Leases
The Company leases store locations, shipcenters, the corporate headquarters and equipment used in its operations and evaluates and classifies its leases as operating or capital leases for financial reporting purposes. Any assets held under a finance lease are included in property and equipment, net. 
Leases are accounted for in accordance with the guidance in "Leases" (Topic 842). The Company is required to recognize an operating lease asset and an operating lease liability for its leases (other than leases that meet the definition of a short-term lease). The liability is equal to the present value of the lease payments using an estimated incremental borrowing rate, on a collateralized basis over similar term, that the Company would have incurred to borrow the funds necessary to purchase the leased asset. The asset is based on the liability, subject to certain adjustments, such as for initial direct costs. Operating leases result in straight-line expense while finance leases result in a front-loaded expense pattern. 
57
At the inception of a lease, the Company determines the lease term, which includes periods under the exercise of renewal options that are reasonably assured. Renewal options are exercised at the Company's sole discretion. In September 2016, the Company signed a 15-year lease for a new corporate headquarters location in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Company currently occupies approximately 230,000 square feet of office space with multiple options to expand in the future. The lease agreement expires in early 2033 with three successive options to renew for additional terms up to approximately fifteen years. The shipcenter in Pedricktown, New Jersey is leased under a lease agreement expiring in 2025 with options to renew for three successive five-year periods. Generally, the Company’s store leases have expected lease terms of ten years, which are comprised of an initial term of ten years or an initial term of five years and 
one
 assumed five-year extension, resulting in a ten-year life. The expected lease term is used to determine whether a lease is finance or operating and to calculate straight-line rent expense. 
Substantially all of the Company's leases include options that allow the Company to renew or extend the lease term beyond the initial lease period, subject to terms and conditions agreed upon at the inception of the lease. Such terms and conditions include rental rates agreed upon at the inception of the lease that could represent below or above market rental rates later in the life of the lease, depending upon market conditions at the time of such renewal or extension. In addition, the Company's leases may include early termination options.

Other Accrued Expenses
Other accrued expenses include accrued capital expenditures of $
25.7
 million and $
48.3
 million in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively.

(l)

Deferred Compensation
The Company approved and adopted the Five Below, Inc. Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Deferred Comp Plan") and a related, irrevocable grantor trust (the "Trust") during fiscal 2021. The Deferred Comp Plan provides eligible key crew with the opportunity to elect to defer up to 80% of their eligible compensation. The Company may make discretionary contributions, at the discretion of the Board. Payments under the Deferred Comp Plan will be made from the general assets of the Company or from the assets of the Trust, funded by the Company. The related liability is recorded as deferred compensation and included in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
(m) 

Equity Method Investments
The Company uses the equity method to account for its investments in which the Company is deemed to have the ability to exercise significant influence over an investee’s operating and financial policies or in which the Company holds a significant partnership or limited liability company interest. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The cost is adjusted to recognize the Company's proportionate share of the investee’s net income or loss after the date of investment and is also adjusted for any impairments resulting from other-than-temporary declines in fair value that is less than its carrying value. During fiscal 2021, the Company recorded an other-than-temporary impairment utilizing the market and cost approach considering historical and projected financial results to calculate fair value. Also related to this investment, management recorded a reserve against outstanding debt owed to the Company based on management’s evaluation of collectability. The total amount of impairment and reserve was approximately $
9.7
 million and was recorded in interest income (expense) and other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.

(n)

Share-Based Compensation
The Company measures the cost of crew services received in exchange for share-based compensation based on the grant date fair value of the employee stock award. The Company recognizes compensation expense generally on a straight-line basis over the crew's requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the equity grant) based on the estimated grant date fair value of restricted stock units ("RSUs") and performance-based restricted stock units ("PSUs") except for PSUs that have a market condition based on its total shareholder return relative to a pre-defined peer group, which are subject to multi-year performance objectives with vesting periods of approximately three years from the date of grant (if the applicable performance objectives are achieved). The fair value of these PSUs are determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which utilizes multiple input variables such as (i) total shareholder return from the beginning of the performance cycle through the performance measurement date(s); (ii) volatility; (iii) risk-free interest rates; and (iv) the correlation of the pre-defined peer group's total shareholder return. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for grants of stock options.
The fair value of restricted stock awards are based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the grant date and the fair value of stock options are based on the Black-Scholes option-pricing model utilizing the closing price of the Company's common stock on the grant date as the fair value of common stock in the model. Future share-based compensation cost will increase when the Company grants additional equity awards. Modifications, cancellations or repurchases of awards after the grant date may require the Company to accelerate any remaining unearned share-based compensation cost or incur incremental compensation costs. Share-based compensation cost recognized and included in expenses for fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, was $
15.6
 million, $
17.9
 million and $
23.6
 million, respectively.

(o)
Revenue Recognition
Revenue from store operations, including third-party delivery services, is recognized at the point of sale when control of the product is transferred to the customer at such time. Internet sales, through the Company's fivebelow.com e-commerce website and mobile app, are recognized when the customer receives the product as control transfers upon delivery. Returns subsequent to the period end are immaterial; accordingly, no significant reserve has been recorded. Gift card sales to customers are initially recorded as liabilities and recognized as sales upon redemption for merchandise or as breakage revenue in proportion to the pattern of redemption of the gift cards by the customer in net sales. 
The transaction price for the Company’s sales is based on the item’s stated price. To the extent that the Company charges customers for shipping and handling on e-commerce sales, the Company records such amounts in net sales. Shipping and handling costs, which include fulfillment and shipping costs related to the Company's e-commerce operations, are included in costs of goods sold. The Company has elected to exclude all sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities from net sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
(p)
Supply Chain Finance
During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company implemented a supply chain finance program. The Company utilizes a supply chain finance program whereby qualifying suppliers may elect at their sole discretion to sell the Company's payment obligations to a designated third-party financial institution. While the terms of these agreements are between the supplier and the financial institution, the financial institution allows the participating suppliers to utilize the Company's creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs. The payment terms that the Company has with participating suppliers under these programs generally range up to 90 days. The Company’s obligations to its suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment dates, are not impacted by suppliers’ decisions to finance amounts under these arrangements. Supplier participation is voluntary, and there are no assets pledged as security or other forms of guarantees provided for the committed payment to the financial institution. As of February 1, 2025, the amount of obligations outstanding under the supply chain finance program, which are included within 
Accounts payable
 in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, was $
0.7
 million.
(q) 
Shipping and Handling Revenues and Costs
The Company includes all shipping and handling revenue from e-commerce sales in net sales. Shipping and handling costs, which are included in cost of goods sold in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, include fulfillment and shipping costs related to the Company's e-commerce operations.
(r) 
Cost of Goods Sold
Cost of goods sold reflects the direct costs of purchased merchandise and inbound freight and tariffs, as well as store occupancy, distribution and buying expenses. Store occupancy costs include rent, common area maintenance, utilities and property taxes for all store locations. Distribution costs include costs for receiving, processing, warehousing and shipping of merchandise to or from the Company's shipcenters and between store locations. Buying costs include compensation expense for the Company's internal buying organization.
60
(s) 
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (including Depreciation and Amortization)
Selling, general and administrative expenses (including depreciation and amortization) include payroll and other compensation, marketing and advertising expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other selling and administrative expenses.

(t) 
Vendor Allowances
The Company receives various incentives in the form of allowances, free product and promotional funds from its vendors based on product purchases and advertising activities. The amounts received are subject to changes in market conditions, vendor marketing strategies and changes in the profitability or sell-through of the related merchandise for the Company. Merchandise allowances are recognized in the period the related merchandise is sold within cost of goods sold. Marketing allowances are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses and are recognized in the period the related advertising occurs to the extent the allowance is a reimbursement that is specific and incremental, and identifiable costs have been incurred by the Company to sell the vendor’s products. To the extent these conditions are not met, these allowances are recorded as merchandise allowances.
(u) 
Store Pre-Opening Costs
Costs incurred between completion of a new store location’s construction and its opening (pre-opening costs) are charged to expense as incurred. Pre-opening costs were $
18.9
 million, $
18.3
 million and $
10.7
 million in fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023, and fiscal 2022, respectively, and are recorded in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations based on the nature of the expense.
(v) 
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are charged to expense as the advertising takes place. Advertising expenses were $
64.3
 million, $
62.5
 million and $
54.1
 million in fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively, and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
(w) 
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset-and-liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.
The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets when uncertainty regarding their realizability exists. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.
(x) 
Commitments and Contingencies
Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties, and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. Legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred.
(y) 
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management of the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the carrying 
61
amount of property and equipment, net realizable value for inventories, income taxes, share-based compensation expense, the incremental borrowing rate utilized in operating lease liabilities, equity method investments, and notes receivable.

Leases
The Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract. Operating lease assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and operating lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of the remaining future minimum lease payments. As the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable for the Company's leases, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of future lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate represents a significant judgment and is determined based on an analysis of the Company's synthetic credit rating, prevailing financial market conditions, corporate bond yields, treasury bond yields, and the effect of collateralization. The operating lease assets also include lease payments made before commencement and exclude lease incentives.
62
The Company’s real estate leases typically contain options that permit renewals for additional periods of up to 
five years
. For real estate leases, except for renewals that generally take the lease to a 
ten-year
 term, the options to renew are not considered reasonably certain at lease commencement because the Company reevaluates each lease on a regular basis to consider the economic and strategic benefits of exercising the renewal options, and regularly opens, relocates or closes stores to align with its operating strategy. Therefore, generally, except for renewals that take the lease to a 
ten-year
 term, the renewal option periods are not included within the lease term and the associated payments are not included in the measurement of the operating lease asset and operating lease liability as the exercise of such options is not reasonably certain. The Company’s operating lease agreements, including assumed renewals, which are generally those that take the lease to a 
ten-year
 term, expire through fiscal 2037. Similarly, renewal options are not included in the lease term for non-real estate leases because they are not considered reasonably certain of being exercised at lease commencement. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets and lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the short-term lease.
For certain real estate leases, the Company accounts for lease components and non-lease components as a single lease component. Certain real estate leases require additional payments for reimbursement of real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance as well as payments based on sales volume, all of which are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs. Other real estate leases contain one fixed lease payment that includes real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance. These fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities.
All of the Company's leases are classified as operating leases and the associated assets and liabilities are presented as separate captions in the consolidated balance sheets. As of February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024, the weighted average remaining lease term for the Company's operating leases was 
7.4
 years and 
7.5
 years, respectively, and the weighted average discount rate was 
5.3
% and 
5.3
%, respectively.

Income Per Common Share
Basic income per common share amounts are calculated using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted income per common share amounts are calculated using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period and include the dilutive impact of exercised stock options as well as assumed vesting of restricted stock awards and shares currently available for purchase under the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan, using the treasury stock method. Performance-based restricted stock units are considered contingently issuable shares for diluted income per common share purposes and the dilutive impact, if any, is not included in the weighted-average shares until the performance conditions are met. The dilutive impact, if any, for performance-based restricted stock units, which are subject to market conditions based on the Company's total shareholder return relative to a pre-defined peer group, are included in the weighted average shares.

Line of Credit
On September 16, 2022, the Company entered into a Second Amendment to Credit Agreement (the "Second Amendment") which amended the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of April 24, 2020, as previously amended by that certain First Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of January 27, 2021 (the "First Amendment"; the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement as amended by the First Amendment and the Second Amendment, the “Credit Agreement”), among the Company, 1616 Holdings, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ("1616 Holdings" and together with the Company, the "Loan Parties"), Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as administrative agent (the "Agent"), and other lenders party thereto (the "Lenders").
The Credit Agreement provides for a secured asset-based revolving line of credit in the amount of up to $
225
 million (the "Revolving Credit Facility"). Advances under the Revolving Credit Facility are tied to a borrowing base consisting of eligible credit card receivables and inventory, as reduced by certain reserves in effect from time to time. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, inventory appraisals and certain other diligence items are deferred, with reduced advance rates during the period that such appraisals have not been delivered. Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the Revolving Credit Facility expires on the earliest to occur of (i) September 16, 2027 or (ii) an event of default.
The Second Amendment also replaced the existing LIBOR (the "London Interbank Offered Rate") provisions with SOFR (the "Secured Overnight Financing Rate") provisions which converted then outstanding LIBOR loans into SOFR loans and additionally makes a number of other revisions to other provisions of the Credit Agreement. Giving effect to the Second Amendment, outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility would accrue interest at floating rates plus an applicable margin ranging from 
1.12
% to 
1.50
% for SOFR loans and 
0.125
% to 
0.50
% for base rate loans, and letter of credit fees range from 
1.125
% to 
1.50
%, in each case based on the average availability under the Revolving Credit Facility.  
The Revolving Credit Facility may be increased by up to an additional $150.0 million, subject to certain conditions, including obtaining commitments from one or more Lenders (the "Accordion"). Pursuant to the First Amendment, the Company obtained commitments from the Lenders that would allow the Company at its election (subject only to satisfaction of certain customary conditions such as the absence of any Event of Default), to increase the amount of the Revolving Credit Facility by an aggregate principal amount up to $
50
 million within the Accordion (the "Committed Increase"). The entire amount of the Revolving Credit Facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit and allows for swingline loans.  
The Credit Agreement contains customary covenants that limit, absent lender approval, the ability of the Company and certain of its affiliates to, among other things, pay cash dividends, incur debt, create liens and encumbrances, redeem or repurchase stock, enter into certain acquisition transactions with affiliates, merge, dissolve, repay certain indebtedness, change the nature of the Company’s business, enter sale or leaseback transactions, make investments or dispose of assets. In some cases, these restrictions are subject to certain negotiated exceptions or permit the Company to undertake otherwise restricted activities if it satisfies certain conditions. In addition, the Company will be required to maintain availability of not less than (i) 
12.5
% of the lesser of (x) aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility and (y) the borrowing base (the "loan cap") during the period that inventory appraisals have not been delivered as described above and (ii) at all other times 
10.0
% of the loan cap. 
If there exists an event of default or availability under the Revolving Credit Facility is less than 15% of the loan cap, amounts in any of the Loan Parties' or subsidiary guarantors' designated deposit accounts will be transferred daily into a blocked account held by the Agent and applied to reduce outstanding amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility (the "Cash Dominion Event"), so long as (i) such event of default has not been waived and/or (ii) until availability has exceeded 15% of the loan cap for sixty (60) consecutive calendar days (provided that such ability to discontinue the Cash Dominion Event shall be limited to two times during the term of the Credit Agreement). 
The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default including, among other things, failure to pay obligations when due, initiation of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, defaults on certain other indebtedness, change of control, incurrence of certain material judgments that are not stayed, satisfied, bonded or discharged within 30 days, certain ERISA events, invalidity of the credit documents, and violation of affirmative and negative covenants or breach of representations and warranties set forth in the Credit Agreement. Amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility may become due upon events of default (subject to any applicable grace or cure periods). 
All obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by 1616 Holdings and secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and 1616 Holdings. As of February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024, the Company was in compliance with the covenants applicable to it under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
During fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, the Company had 
no
 borrowings or interest expense under the Revolving Credit Facility.
65
As of February 1, 2025, the Company had approximately $
225
 million available on the Revolving Credit Facility. As of February 3, 2024, the Company had approximately $
216
 million available on the Revolving Credit Facility.

Commitments and Contingencies
Commitments
Other Contractual Commitments
The Company has an executive severance plan that is applicable to certain key crew that provide for, among other things, salary, bonus, severance, and change-in-control provisions. 
As of February 1, 2025, the Company has other purchase commitments of approximately $
2.1
 million consisting of purchase agreements for materials that will be used in the construction of new stores. 
Contingencies
Legal Matters
The Company is subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, and claims arising in the ordinary course of the Company's business. Many of these actions raise complex factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties. Actions filed against the Company from time to time include commercial, intellectual property, customer, and employment actions, including class action lawsuits. The plaintiffs in some actions seek unspecified damages or injunctive relief, or both. Actions are in various procedural stages, and some are covered in part by insurance. The Company cannot predict with assurance the outcome of actions brought against the Company. Accordingly, adverse developments, settlements, or resolutions may occur and negatively impact income in the quarter of such development, settlement or resolution. If a potential loss arising from these lawsuits, claims and pending actions is probable and reasonably estimable, the Company records the estimated liability based on circumstances and assumptions existing at the time. Although the outcome of these and other claims cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.
On August 1, 2024, a putative class action was filed against Five Below, Inc. and a certain former senior officer in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, purportedly on behalf of a class of the Company's investors who purchased or otherwise acquired our publicly traded securities between March 20, 2024 and July 16, 2024. On September 16, 2024, a similar action was commenced against Five Below, Inc. in the same court on behalf of a class of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired our publicly traded securities between December 1, 2022 and July 16, 2024. The complaints allege violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder in connection with various public statements made by us. On October 28, 2024, the court entered an order consolidating the actions and appointing lead plaintiff. Lead plaintiff filed its Consolidated Amended Complaint against the Company and one former senior officer and one current senior officer on January 13, 2025. Defendants filed their motion to dismiss the Consolidated Amended Complaint on March 14, 2025. Lead plaintiff’s opposition to defendants’ motion to dismiss is due on or before May 13, 2025, and any reply in support of defendants’ motion to dismiss is due on or before July 11, 2025.  The Company intends to vigorously defend against this action, which the Company believes to be without merit. The potential impact of this action, which seeks unspecified damages, attorneys’ fees and expenses, is uncertain.
From time to time, the Company is involved in certain legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In management’s opinion, the outcome of such actions will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

Common Stock 
The Five Below, Inc. 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”) is intended to be qualified as an “employee stock purchase plan” within the meaning of Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance, which is subject to other limitations, is 
500,000
 shares. The ESPP allows eligible crew the opportunity to purchase, subject to limitations, shares of the Company’s common stock through payroll deductions at a discount of 
10
% of the fair market value of such shares on the purchase date. In fiscal 2024, the Company issued 
9,908
 shares of common stock under the ESPP resulting in proceeds of $
1.1
 million and recorded share-based compensation expense of $
88
 thousand in connection with the ESPP related to the amount of the discount. In fiscal 2023, the Company issued 
4,818
 shares of common stock under the ESPP resulting in proceeds of $
1.0
 million and recorded share-based compensation expense of $
96
 thousand in connection with the ESPP related to the amount of the discount. In fiscal 2022, the Company issued 
6,489
 shares of common stock under the ESPP resulting in proceeds of $
0.8
 million and recorded share-based compensation expense of $
78
 thousand in connection with the ESPP related to the amount of the discount.

Share-Based Compensation
Equity Incentive Plan
Pursuant to the Company's 2022 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), the Company’s Board of Directors may grant stock options, restricted shares and restricted stock units to officers, directors, key crew and professional service providers. The Plan allows for the issuance of up to a total of 
4.3
 million shares under the Plan. As of February 1, 2025, approximately 
3.2
 million stock options, restricted shares, or restricted stock units were available for grant.

Common Stock Options
All stock options have a term not greater than 
ten years
. Stock options vest and become exercisable in whole or in part, in accordance with vesting conditions set by the Company’s Board of Directors. Options granted to date generally vest over 
four years
 from the date of grant.

The fair value of each option award granted to crew, including outside directors, is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company did not grant any stock options in fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022.
The Company uses the simplified method to estimate the expected term of the option. The expected volatility incorporates historical and implied volatility of similar entities whose share prices are publicly available. The risk-free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. 
The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 was $
0.6
 million
, $
1.1
 million and $
3.1
 million, respectively. There were no 
stock options outstanding and exercisable as of February 1, 2025. In fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, the Company received cash from the exercise of options of $
0.3
 million, $
0.3
 million and $
0.8

Restricted Stock Units and Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units
All restricted stock units ("RSU") and performance-based restricted stock units ("PSU") vest in accordance with vesting conditions set by the compensation committee of the Company’s Board of Directors. RSUs granted to date generally have vesting periods ranging from less than one year to five years from the date of grant and the fair value of RSUs is the market price of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. PSUs granted to date generally have vesting periods ranging from less than one year to five years from the date of grant.
PSUs that have a performance condition are subject to satisfaction of the applicable performance goals established for the respective grant. The fair value of these PSUs is the market price of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Compensation is recognized over the vesting period and the Company periodically assesses the probability of achievement of the performance criteria and adjusts the amount of compensation expense accordingly.
PSUs that have a market condition based on the Company's total shareholder return relative to a pre-defined peer group are subject to multi-year performance objectives with vesting periods of approximately three years from the date of grant (if the applicable performance objectives are achieved). The fair value of these PSUs is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which utilizes multiple input variables such as (i) total shareholder return from the beginning of the performance cycle through the performance measurement date(s); (ii) volatility; (iii) risk-free interest rates; and (iv) the correlation of the pre-defined peer group's total shareholder return. 
RSU and PSU activity under the Plan was as follows:

Income Taxes
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences representing net future deductible amounts become deductible. 
As of February 1, 2025, there were no material valuation allowances that have been provided for net deferred tax assets as management believes that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize all material deferred tax assets before any expirations as of February 1, 2025.

Segment Reporting
The Company has 
one
 reportable and operating segment, which derives revenue from sales of the Company’s merchandise to customers at our 
1,771
 brick & mortar store locations, which operate in 
44
 states, and online at Fivebelow.com. No customer accounts for 10% or more of our revenues. 
The accounting policies of the reportable segment are the same as those described in “Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” 
The chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) is the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer, who assesses and evaluates the performance of the reportable segment. Financial information and data are provided to the CODM on a consolidated basis. The CODM uses consolidated sales and consolidated net income to evaluate performance, make key operating decisions and allocate resources. The Company’s significant segment expenses are included on the “Consolidated Statements of Operations” in Item 8 “Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.” See “Note 2 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers” for the Company’s disaggregated revenue by groups of products.

The sum of the quarterly per share amounts may not equal per share amounts reported for the fiscal year due to rounding.
The Company's business is seasonal in nature and demand is generally the highest in the fourth fiscal quarter due to the fourth quarter holiday season and, therefore, operating results for any fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the full fiscal year. To prepare for the holiday season, the Company must order and keep in stock more merchandise than it carries during other parts of the year. The Company expects inventory levels, along with an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, generally to reach their highest levels in the third and fourth fiscal quarters in anticipation of the increased net sales during the year-end holiday season. As a result of this seasonality, and generally because of variation in consumer spending habits, the Company experiences fluctuations in net sales and working capital requirements during the fiscal year.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
Not applicable.
ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K are effective at a reasonable assurance level in ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a timely manner and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. While our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of their effectiveness, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
71
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the thirteen weeks ended February 1, 2025, as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f), that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of February 1, 2025. Management based this assessment on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in “
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)”
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management determined that, as of February 1, 2025, the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting at a reasonable assurance level.
The effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of February 1, 2025 has been audited by KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report dated March 20, 2025 that appears below.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
Five Below, Inc.:
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
We have audited Five Below, Inc. and subsidiary's (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of February 1, 2025, based on criteria established in
 Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of February 1, 2025, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended February 1, 2025, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated March 20, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
Basis for Opinion 
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
