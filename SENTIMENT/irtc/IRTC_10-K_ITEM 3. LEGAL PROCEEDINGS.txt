ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
From time to time, we are involved in claims and legal proceedings or investigations, that arise in the ordinary course of business. Such matters could have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, and financial condition and divert the attention of our management from the operation of our business. These matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes that are not predictable.
On February 6, 2024, a putative class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that we and our current Chief Executive Officer, Quentin Blackford, our former Chief Financial Officer, Brice Bobzien, and our former Chief Financial Officer and former Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Devine violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and seeks unspecified damages purportedly sustained by the class. On July 19, 2024, an amended complaint was filed, naming us, Mr. Blackford, Mr. Bobzien, Mr. Devine, our Chief Commercial Officer Chad Patterson, our former Chief Technology Officer Mark Day, and our Chief Medical Officer, Chief Scientific Officer, and Executive Vice President of Product Innovation Mintu Turakhia as defendants. On October 7, 2024, a second amended complaint was filed to include events from the recent FDA inspections, but otherwise included the same claims under the Exchange Act. On December 10, 2024, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss.
Our board members and certain of our current and former executives were named as defendants in two complaints filed as stockholder derivative actions in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware and the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, respectively. We are named as a nominal defendant in both complaints. The cases make similar allegations to those in the securities class action complaint described above and both cases have both been stayed pending the resolution of motion to dismiss briefing in the securities class action.
W
e believe the above securities class action and derivative lawsuits to be without merit and plan to continue to defend ourselves vigorously.
On March 26, 2021, we received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California requesting information related to communications with the Food and Drug Administration and our products and services. On September 13, 2021, we received a second subpoena requesting additional information. On April 4, 2023, we received a Subpoena Duces Tecum from the Consumer Protection Branch, Civil Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”), requesting production of various documents regarding our products and services. We are cooperating fully on these matters. 
On July 1, 2024, the DOJ filed with the United States District Court for the Northern District of California a Petition for Order to Show Cause and Application for Enforcement with respect to the production of certain documentary materials which we assert are protected by legal privileges. We defended our privilege assertions over such materials in our response to the DOJ’s petition. The matter has been briefed, and oral argument is scheduled for March 6, 2025.

On February 20, 2024, Welch Allyn, Inc. (“Welch Allyn”), a subsidiary of Hill-Rom Holdings, Inc. now part of Baxter International, Inc., filed a lawsuit against us in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging that our Zio devices infringe certain of its patents and that the Company’s infringement was willful. We filed a motion to dismiss Welch Allyn’s willful infringement claims on April 11, 2024. Welch Allyn filed an amended complaint on April 24, 2024 that continued to allege that our Zio devices infringe certain of its patents and that our infringement was willful. We filed a motion to dismiss Welch Allyn’s willful infringement allegations found in the amended complaint on May 22, 2024 and a hearing on the motion to dismiss was held on January 28, 2025. After hearing arguments, the Court granted our motion and the willful infringement claims in the amended complaint were dismissed without prejudice. Welch Allyn filed a second amended complaint adding additional patent claims on February 14, 2025. The Company is preparing to file a response to the allegations found in the second amended complaint no later than March 21, 2025. Welch Allyn seeks money damages and attorneys’ fees. We believe this lawsuit is without merit and plan to defend ourselves vigorously. 
On December 10, 2024, Bardy Diagnostics, Inc. (“BardyDx”), a subsidiary of Hill-Rom Holdings, Inc. now part of Baxter International, Inc., filed a lawsuit against us in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging that our Zio Monitor patch infringes one of its patents. On December 26, 2024, BardyDx filed an amended complaint alleging that the Company's Zio Monitor patch infringes two of its patents. We are preparing to file a response to the allegations found in the amended complaint no later than March 3, 2025. BardyDx seeks money damages and attorneys’ fees. We believe this lawsuit is without merit and plan to defend ourselves vigorously. 
At this time, we are unable to predict the eventual scope, duration or outcome of the aforementioned proceedings. See also Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Other Legal and Regulatory Matters” for more information on these matters.
