Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
    The following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included below in Item 8 of this report and the Risk Factors included above in Part I, Item 1A of this report. In addition, investors should review the “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” above.
Overview
We provide private MI through our primary insurance subsidiary, NMIC. NMIC is wholly-owned, domiciled in Wisconsin and principally regulated by the Wisconsin OCI. NMIC is approved as an MI provider by the GSEs and is licensed to write coverage in all 50 states and D.C. Our subsidiary, NMIS, provides outsourced loan review services to mortgage loan originators and our subsidiary, Re One, historically provided reinsurance coverage to NMIC in accordance with certain statutory risk retention requirements. Such requirements have been repealed and the reinsurance coverage provided by Re One to NMIC has been commuted. Re One remains a wholly-owned, licensed insurance subsidiary; however, it does not currently have active insurance exposures.
MI protects lenders and investors from default-related losses on a portion of the unpaid principal balance of a covered mortgage. MI plays a critical role in the U.S. housing market by mitigating mortgage credit risk and facilitating the secondary market sale of high-LTV (
i.e., 
above 80%) residential loans to the GSEs, who are otherwise restricted by their charters from purchasing or guaranteeing high-LTV mortgages that are not covered by certain credit protections. Such credit protection and secondary market sales allow lenders to increase their capacity for mortgage commitments and expand financing access to existing and prospective homeowners.
NMIH, a Delaware corporation, was incorporated in May 2011, and we began start-up operations in 2012 and wrote our first MI policy in 2013. Since formation, we have sought to establish customer relationships with a broad group of mortgage lenders and build a diversified, high-quality insured portfolio. As of December 31, 2024, we had issued master policies with 2,086 customers, including national and regional mortgage banks, money center banks, credit unions, community banks, builder-owned mortgage lenders, internet-sourced lenders and other non-bank lenders. As of December 31, 2024, we had $210.2 billion of primary IIF and $56.1 billion of primary RIF. 
We believe that our success in acquiring a large and diverse group of lender customers and growing a portfolio of high-quality IIF traces to our founding principles, whereby we aim to help qualified individuals achieve their homeownership goals, ensure that we remain a strong and credible counter-party, deliver a high-quality customer service experience, establish a differentiated risk management approach that emphasizes the individual underwriting review or validation of the vast majority of the loans we insure, utilizing our proprietary Rate GPS
®
 pricing platform to dynamically evaluate risk and price our policies, and foster a culture of collaboration and excellence that helps us attract and retain experienced industry leaders. 
Our strategy is to continue to build on our position in the private MI market, expand our customer base and grow our insured portfolio of high-quality residential loans by focusing on long-term customer relationships, disciplined and proactive risk selection and pricing, fair and transparent claim payment practices, responsive customer service, and financial strength and profitability. 
 Our common stock trades on the Nasdaq under the symbol “NMIH.” Our headquarters is located in Emeryville, California. As of December 31, 2024, we had 230 employees. Our corporate website is located at

We discuss below our results of operations for the periods presented, as well as the conditions and trends that have impacted or are expected to impact our business, including new insurance writings, the composition of our insurance portfolio and other factors that we expect to impact our results.

Conditions and Trends Affecting Our Business
Macroeconomic Developments
Macroeconomic factors, including persistent inflation, elevated interest rates, flagging consumer confidence and increasing jobless claims could have a pronounced impact on the housing market, the mortgage insurance industry and our business in future periods. A marked decline in housing demand, a significant and protracted decrease in house prices or a sustained increase in unemployment could reduce the pace of new business activity in the private mortgage insurance market and negatively impact our future NIW volume, or contribute to an increase in our future default and claim experience. 
Key Factors Affecting Our Results
Customer Development
We have important relationships with customers across all categories and allocation profiles, including National Accounts and Regional Accounts, and centralized and decentralized lenders. Our sales and marketing efforts are broadly focused on expanding our presence with existing customers and activating new customer relationships. We consider an activation to be the point at which we have signed a Master Policy, established IT connectivity and generated a first application or first dollar of NIW from a customer. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we activated 118 lenders, compared to 70 and 120 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We also continued to expand our business with existing customers, deepening our existing relationships and capturing what we believe to be an increasing portion of their annual MI volume. At December 31, 2024, we had issued 2,086 Master Policies and established 1,621 active customer relationships, compared to 1,974 and 1,503, respectively, as of December 31, 2023 and 1,875 and 1,434, respectively, as of December 31, 2022.
New Insurance Written, Insurance-In-Force and Risk-In-Force
NIW is the aggregate unpaid principal balance of mortgages underpinning new policies written during a given period. Our NIW is affected by the overall size of the mortgage origination market and the volume of high-LTV mortgage originations. Our NIW is also affected by the percentage of such high-LTV originations covered by private versus government MI or other alternative credit enhancement structures and our share of the private MI market. NIW, together with persistency, drives our IIF. IIF is the aggregate unpaid principal balance of the mortgages we insure, as reported to us by servicers at a given date, and represents the sum total of NIW from all prior periods less principal payments on insured mortgages and policy cancellations (including for prepayment, nonpayment of premiums, coverage rescission and claim payments). RIF is related to IIF and represents the aggregate amount of coverage we provide on all outstanding policies at a given date. RIF is calculated as the sum total of the coverage percentage of each individual policy in our portfolio applied to the unpaid principal balance of such insured mortgage. RIF is affected by IIF and the LTV profile of our insured mortgages, with lower LTV loans generally having a lower coverage percentage and higher LTV loans having a higher coverage percentage. Gross RIF represents RIF before consideration of reinsurance. Net RIF is gross RIF net of ceded reinsurance.
Net Premiums Written and Net Premiums Earned
We set our premium rates on individual policies based on the risk characteristics of the underlying mortgage loans and borrowers, and in accordance with our filed rates and applicable rating rules. On June 4, 2018, we introduced a proprietary risk-based pricing platform, which we refer to as Rate GPS
®
. Rate GPS
®
 considers a broad range of individual variables, including property type, type of loan product, borrower credit characteristics, and lender and market factors, and provides us with the ability to set and charge premium rates commensurate with the underlying risk of each loan that we insure. We introduced Rate GPS
®
 in June 2018 to replace our previous rate card pricing system. While most of our new business is priced through Rate GPS
®
, we also continue to offer a rate card pricing option to a limited number of lender customers who require a rate card for operational reasons. We believe the introduction and utilization of Rate GPS
®
 provides us with a more granular and analytical approach to evaluating and pricing risk, and that this approach enhances our ability to continue building a high-quality mortgage insurance portfolio and delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns.
Premiums are generally fixed for the duration of our coverage of the underlying loans. Net premiums written are equal to gross premiums written minus ceded premiums written under our reinsurance arrangements, less premium refunds and premium write-offs. As a result, net premiums written are generally influenced by:
•
NIW;
•
premium rates and the mix of premium payment type, which are either single, monthly or annual premiums, as described below;
55
•
cancellation rates of our insurance policies, which are impacted by payments or prepayments on mortgages, refinancings (which are affected by prevailing mortgage interest rates as compared to interest rates on loans underpinning our in force policies), levels of claim payments and home prices; and
•
cession of premiums under third-party reinsurance arrangements.
Premiums are paid either by the borrower (borrower-paid mortgage insurance or BPMI) or the lender (lender-paid mortgage insurance or LPMI) in a single payment at origination (single premium), on a monthly installment basis (monthly premium) or on an annual installment basis (annual premium). Our net premiums written will differ from our net premiums earned due to policy payment type. For single premiums, we receive a single premium payment at origination, which is earned over the estimated life of the policy. Substantially all of our single premium policies in force as of December 31, 2024 were non-refundable under most cancellation scenarios. If non-refundable single premium policies are canceled, we immediately recognize the remaining unearned premium balances as earned premium revenue. Monthly premiums are recognized in the month billed and when the coverage is effective. Annual premiums are earned on a straight-line basis over the year of coverage. Substantially all of our policies provide for either single or monthly premiums.
The percentage of IIF that remains on our books after any twelve-month period is defined as our persistency rate. Because our insurance premiums are earned over the life of a policy, higher persistency rates can have a significant impact on our net premiums earned and profitability. Generally, faster speeds of mortgage prepayment lead to lower persistency. Prepayment speeds and the relative mix of business between single and monthly premium policies also impact our profitability. Our premium rates include certain assumptions regarding repayment or prepayment speeds of the mortgages underlying our policies. Because premiums are paid at origination on single premium policies and our single premium policies are generally non-refundable on cancellation, assuming all other factors remain constant, if single premium loans are prepaid earlier than expected, our profitability on these loans is likely to increase and, if loans are repaid slower than expected, our profitability on these loans is likely to decrease. By contrast, if monthly premium loans are repaid earlier than anticipated, we do not earn any more premium with respect to those loans and, unless we replace the repaid monthly premium loan with a new loan at the same premium rate or higher, our revenue is likely to decline.
Effect of Reinsurance on Our Results
We utilize third-party reinsurance to actively manage our risk, ensure compliance with PMIERs, state regulatory and other applicable capital requirements, and support the growth of our business. We currently have both quota share and excess-of-loss reinsurance agreements in place, which impact our results of operations and regulatory capital and PMIERs asset positions. Under a quota share reinsurance agreement, the reinsurer receives a premium in exchange for covering an agreed-upon portion of incurred losses. Such a quota share arrangement reduces premiums written and earned and also reduces RIF, providing capital relief to the ceding insurance company and reducing incurred claims in accordance with the terms of the reinsurance agreement. In addition, reinsurers typically pay ceding commissions as part of quota share transactions, which offset the ceding company's acquisition and underwriting expenses. Certain quota share agreements include profit commissions that are earned based on loss performance and serve to reduce ceded premiums. Under an excess-of-loss agreement, the ceding insurer is typically responsible for losses up to an agreed-upon threshold and the reinsurer then provides coverage in excess of such threshold up to a maximum agreed-upon limit. We expect to continue to evaluate reinsurance opportunities in the normal course of business.
Excess-of-Loss Reinsurance
Insurance-Linked Notes
NMIC is party to reinsurance agreements with the Oaktown Re Vehicles that provide it with aggregate excess-of-loss reinsurance coverage on defined portfolios of mortgage insurance policies. Under each agreement, NMIC retains a first layer of aggregate loss exposure on covered policies and the respective Oaktown Re Vehicle then provides second layer loss protection up to a defined reinsurance coverage amount. NMIC then retains losses in excess of the respective reinsurance coverage amounts.
The respective reinsurance coverage amounts provided by the Oaktown Re Vehicles decrease over a 12.5-year period as the underlying insured mortgages are amortized or repaid, and/or the mortgage insurance coverage is canceled. As the reinsurance coverage decreases, a prescribed amount of collateral held in trust by the Oaktown Re Vehicles is distributed to ILN Transaction noteholders as amortization of the outstanding insurance-linked note principal balances. The outstanding reinsurance coverage amounts stop amortizing, and the distribution of collateral assets to ILN Transaction noteholders and amortization of insurance-linked note principal is suspended if certain credit enhancement or delinquency thresholds, as defined in each agreement, are triggered (each, a Lock-Out Event).
NMIC holds optional termination rights under each ILN Transaction, including, among others, an optional call feature 
56
which provides NMIC the discretion to terminate the transaction on or after a prescribed date, and a clean-up call if the outstanding reinsurance coverage amount amortizes to 10% or less of the reinsurance coverage amount at inception or if NMIC reasonably determines that changes to GSE or rating agency asset requirements would cause a material and adverse effect on the capital treatment afforded to NMIC under a given agreement. In addition, there are certain events that trigger mandatory termination of an agreement, including NMIC's failure to pay premiums or consent to reductions in a trust account to make principal payments to noteholders, among others. 
Effective July 25, 2024 and December 27, 2024, NMIC exercised its optional termination rights to terminate its previously outstanding reinsurance agreements with and associated insurance-linked-notes issued by Oaktown Re III Ltd. and by Oaktown Re V Ltd., respectively. In connection with the terminations, NMIC's excess of loss reinsurance agreements with Oaktown Re III Ltd. and Oaktown Re V Ltd. were commuted and the insurance-linked notes issued by Oaktown Re III Ltd. and Oaktown Re V Ltd. were redeemed in full with a distribution of remaining collateral assets.

Traditional Reinsurance 
NMIC is party to six excess-of-loss reinsurance agreements with broad panels of third-party reinsurers – the 2022-1 XOL Transaction, effective April 1, 2022, the 2022-2 XOL Transaction, effective July 1, 2022, the 2022-3 XOL Transaction, effective October 1, 2022, the 2023-1 XOL Transaction, effective January 1, 2023, the 2023-2 XOL Transaction, effective July 1, 2023, and the 2024 XOL Transaction, effective January 1, 2024 – which we refer to collectively as the XOL Transactions. Each XOL Transaction provides NMIC with aggregate excess-of-loss reinsurance coverage on a defined portfolio of mortgage insurance policies. Under each agreement, NMIC retains a first layer of aggregate loss exposure on covered policies and the reinsurers then provide second layer loss protection up to a defined reinsurance coverage amount. The reinsurance coverage amount of each XOL Transaction is set to approximate the PMIERs minimum required assets of its reference pool and decreases from its peak over a ten-year period in the event the PMIERs minimum required assets of the pool declines. NMIC retains losses in excess of the outstanding reinsurance coverage amount.
NMIC holds optional termination rights which provide it the discretion to terminate each XOL Transaction on or after a specified date. NMIC may also elect to terminate the XOL Transactions at any point if the outstanding reinsurance coverage amount amortizes to 10% or less of the reinsurance coverage amount provided at inception, or if it determines that it will no longer be able to take full PMIERs asset credit for the coverage. Additionally, under the terms of the treaties, NMIC may selectively terminate its engagement with individual reinsurers under certain circumstances. Such selective termination rights arise when, among other reasons, a reinsurer experiences a deterioration in its capital position below a prescribed threshold, and/or a reinsurer breaches (and fails to cure) its collateral posting obligation.
Each of the third-party reinsurance providers that is party to the XOL Transactions has an insurer financial strength rating of A- or better by S&P, A.M. Best or both.

(2)     Approximately 1% of the production covered by the 2022-1 XOL Transaction has coverage reporting dates between October 21, 2019 and September 30, 2021.
(3)     Approximately 1% of the production covered by the 2022-2 XOL Transaction has coverage reporting dates between January 4, 2021 and March 31, 2022.
(4)    The 2024 XOL Transaction provides coverage for production generated between January 1, 2024 and December 31, 2024. The current reinsurance coverage and current first layer retained loss will decrease in future periods to the extent the PMIERs minimum required assets of the covered pool declines.
In October 2024, NMIC entered into two sequential excess-of-loss reinsurance treaties that will provide aggregate coverage for mortgage insurance policies to be written in 2025 and 2026 (the 2025 XOL Transaction and 2026 XOL Transaction, respectively). Under the terms of each agreement, NMIC will retain a first layer of aggregate loss exposure on covered policies and its reinsurance counterparties will then provide second layer loss protection up to a defined reinsurance coverage amount (of $283.8 million for the 2025 XOL Transaction and $164.2 million for the 2026 XOL Transaction). NMIC retains losses in excess of the respective reinsurance coverage amounts.
Quota Share Reinsurance 
NMIC is party to eight quota share reinsurance treaties – the 2016 QSR Transaction, effective September 1, 2016 and as modified April 1, 2019, the 2018 QSR Transaction, effective January 1, 2018, the 2020 QSR Transaction, effective April 1, 2020 and as amended January 1, 2024, the 2021 QSR Transaction, effective January 1, 2021, the 2022 QSR Transaction, effective October 1, 2021, the 2022 Seasoned QSR Transaction, effective July 1, 2022, the 2023 QSR Transaction, effective January 1, 2023 and the 2024 QSR Transaction, effective January 1, 2024 – which we refer to collectively as the QSR Transactions. Under each of the QSR Transactions, NMIC cedes a proportional share of its risk on eligible policies to panels of third-party reinsurance providers. Each of the third-party reinsurance providers that is party to the QSR Transactions has an insurer financial strength rating of A- or better by S&P, A.M. Best or both.
Under the terms of the 2016 QSR Transaction, NMIC cedes premiums written related to 20.5% of the risk on eligible primary policies written for all periods through December 31, 2017 in exchange for reimbursement of ceded claims and claim expenses on covered policies, a 20% ceding commission, and a profit 
commission of up to 60% that varies directly and inversely with ceded claims. 
Under the terms of the 2018 QSR Transaction, NMIC cedes premiums earned related to 25% of the risk on eligible policies written in 2018 and 20% of the risk on eligible policies written in 2019, in exchange for reimbursement of ceded claims and claim expenses on covered policies, a 20% ceding commission, and a profit commission of up to 61% that varies directly and inversely with ceded claims.
Under the terms of the 2020 QSR Transaction, NMIC cedes premiums earned related to 21% of the risk on eligible policies written between April 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020, in exchange for reimbursement of ceded claims and claim expenses on covered po
licies, a 36% ceding commission, and a profit commission of up to 50% that varies directly and inversely with ceded claims. 
Under the terms of the 2021 QSR Transaction, NMIC cedes premiums earned related to 22.5% of the risk on eligible policies written in 2021 (subject to an aggregate risk written limit which was exhausted on October 30, 2021), in exchange for reimbursement of ceded claims and claim expenses on covered policies, a 20% ceding commission, and a profit commission of up to 57.5% that varies directly and inversely with ceded claims.
Under the terms of the 2022 QSR Transaction, NMIC cedes premiums earned related to 20% of the risk on eligible policies written between October 30, 2021 and December 31, 2022, in exchange for reimbursement of ceded claims and claim 
58
expenses on covered policies, a 20% ceding commission, and a profit commission of up to 62% that varies directly and inversely with ceded claims. 
Under the terms of the 2022 Seasoned QSR Transaction, NMIC cedes premiums earned related to 95% of the net risk on eligible policies primarily for a seasoned pool of mortgage insurance policies originated between January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2016 and July 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020, that had previously been covered under the retired Oaktown Re Ltd. and Oaktown Re IV Ltd. reinsurance transactions, after the consideration of coverage provided by other QSR Transactions, in exchange for reimbursement of ceded claims and claim expenses on covered policies, a 35% ceding commission, and a profit commission of up to 55% that varies directly and inversely with ceded claims.
Under the terms of the 2023 QSR Transaction, NMIC cedes premiums earned related to 20% of the risk on eligible policies written in 2023, in exchange for reimbursement of ceded claims and claim expenses on covered policies, a 20% ceding commission, and a profit commission of up to 62% that varies directly and inversely with ceded claims.
Under the terms of the 2024 QSR Transaction, NMIC cedes premiums earned related to 20% of the risk on eligible policies written in 2024, in exchange for reimbursement of ceded claims and claim expenses on covered policies, a 20% ceding commission, and a profit commission of up to 56% that varies directly and inversely with ceded claims.
NMIC may terminate any or all of the QSR Transactions without penalty if, due to a change in PMIERs requirements, it is no longer able to take full PMIERs asset credit for the RIF ceded under the respective agreements. Additionally, under the terms of the QSR Transactions, NMIC may elect to selectively terminate its engagement with individual reinsurers on a run-off basis (i.e., reinsurers continue providing coverage on all risk ceded prior to the termination date, with no new cessions going forward) or cut-off basis (i.e., the reinsurance arrangement is completely terminated with NMIC recapturing all previously ceded risk) under certain circumstances. Such selective termination rights arise when, among other reasons, a reinsurer experiences a deterioration in its capital position below a prescribed threshold and/or a reinsurer breaches (and fails to cure) its collateral posting obligations under the relevant agreement.
Effective January 1, 2025, NMIC terminated its engagement with one reinsurer under the 2016, 2018 and 2021 QSR Transactions by mutual agreement on a cut-off basis with no termination fees. Upon termination, NMIC recaptured approximately $100 million of previously ceded primary RIF. NMIC will stop ceding new premiums with respect to the recaptured risk and ceded premiums under each agreement will decrease by less than 1% in future periods.
In October 2024, NMIC entered into three sequential quota share reinsurance treaties that will provide coverage for mortgage insurance policies to be written in 2025, 2026 and 2027 (the 2025 QSR Transaction, 2026 QSR Transaction and 2027 QSR Transaction, respectively). Under the terms of the 2025 and 2026 QSR Transactions, NMIC will cede premiums earned related to 20% of the risk on eligible policies written between January 1, 2025 and December 31, 2026, in exchange for reimbursement of ceded claims and claims expenses on covered policies, a 20% ceding commission, and a profit commission of up to 62% that varies directly and inversely with ceded claims. Under the terms of the 2027 QSR Transaction, NMIC will cede premiums earned related to 12% of the risk on eligible policies written between January 1, 2027 and December 31, 2027, in exchange for reimbursement of ceded claims and claims expenses on covered policies, a 20% ceding commission, and a profit commission of up to 61% that varies directly and inversely with ceded claims.

NIW for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased 14% compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to growth in our customer franchise and market presence tied to the increased penetration of existing customer accounts and new customer activations. NIW for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased 31% compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to a decline in the size of the total mortgage insurance market.
Primary IIF increased 7% at December 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023, which in turn grew 6% compared to December 31, 2022, primarily due to the NIW generated between such measurement dates, partially offset by the run-off of in-force policies. 
Our persistency rate was 85%, 86% and 84% at December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Persistency remains historically high due to a continued slowdown in the pace of mortgage refinancing activity tied to the prevailing interest and mortgage rate environment.

Net premiums written increased 12% and 4%, respectively, and net premiums earned increased 11% and 7%, respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, primarily driven by growth in our monthly IIF and monthly pay premiums receipts. The sequential increase in net premiums earned during each successive year was partially offset by a decline in the contribution from single premium policy cancellations period-to-period.

We consider a “book” to be a collective pool of policies insured during a particular period, normally a calendar year. In general, the majority of underwriting profit, calculated as earned premium revenue minus claims and underwriting and operating expenses, generated by a particular book year emerges in the years immediately following origination. This pattern generally occurs because relatively few of the claims that a book will ultimately experience typically occur in the first few years following origination, when premium revenue is highest, while subsequent years are affected by declining premium revenues, as the number of insured loans decreases (primarily due to loan prepayments), and by increasing losses.

We utilize certain risk principles that form the basis of how we underwrite and originate NIW. We have established prudential underwriting standards and loan-level eligibility matrices which prescribe the maximum LTV, minimum borrower FICO score, maximum borrower DTI ratio, maximum loan size, property type, loan type, loan term and occupancy status of loans that we will insure and memorialized these standards and eligibility matrices in our Underwriting Guideline Manual that is publicly available on our website. Our underwriting standards and eligibility criteria are designed to limit the layering of risk in a single insurance policy. “Layered risk” refers to the accumulation of borrower, loan and property risk. For example, we have higher credit score and lower maximum allowed LTV requirements for investor-owned properties, compared to owner-occupied properties. We monitor the concentrations of various risk attributes in our insurance portfolio, which may change over time, in part, as a result of regional conditions or public policy shifts.
The
 tables below present our primary NIW by FICO, LTV and purchase/refinance mix for the periods indicated. We calculate the LTV of a loan as the percentage of the original loan amount to the original purchase value of the property securing the loan.

Insurance Claims and Claim Expenses
Insurance claims and claim expenses incurred represent estimated future payments on newly defaulted insured loans and any change in our claim estimates for previously existing defaults. Claims incurred are generally affected by a variety of factors, including: 
•
future macroeconomic factors, including national and regional unemployment rates, which affect the likelihood that borrowers may default on their loans and probability of claims, and interest rates, which tend to drive increased persistency as they rise, thereby extending the average life of our insured portfolio and increasing expected future claims and decrease persistency as they fall, thereby shortening the average life of our insured portfolio and moderating future expected claims;
•
changes in housing values, as such changes affect loss mitigation opportunities (available to us and a borrower) on loans in default, as well as borrowers' behaviors and willingness to default if the values of their homes are below or perceived to be below the balance of their mortgage;
•
borrowers' FICO scores, with lower FICO scores tending to have a higher probability of claims;
•
borrowers' DTI ratios, with higher DTI ratios tending to have a higher probability of claims;
•
LTV ratios, with higher average LTV ratios tending to increase the probability of claims;
•
the size of loans insured, with higher loan amounts tending to result in higher incurred claim amounts than smaller loan amounts;
•
the percentage of coverage on insured loans, with higher percentages of insurance coverage tending to result in higher incurred claim amounts than lower percentages of insurance coverage;
•
other borrower, property-type and loan level risk characteristics, such as cash-out refinancings, second homes or investment properties; and
•
the level and amount of reinsurance coverage maintained with third parties.
Reserves for claims and claim expenses are established for mortgage loans that are in default. A loan is considered to be in default as of the payment date at which a borrower has missed the preceding two or more consecutive monthly payments. We establish reserves for loans that have been reported to us in default by servicers, referred to as case reserves, and additional loans that we estimate (based on actuarial review and other factors) to be in default that have not yet been reported to us by servicers, referred to as incurred but not reported (IBNR). We also establish reserves for claim expenses, which represent the estimated cost of the claim administration process, including legal and other fees and other general expenses of administering the claim settlement process. Reserves are not established for future claims on insured loans which are not currently reported or which we estimate are not currently in default.
Reserves are established by estimating the number of loans in default that will result in a claim payment, which is referred to as claim frequency, and the amount of the claim payment expected to be paid on each such loan in default, which is referred to as claim severity. Claim frequency and severity estimates are established based on historical observed experience regarding certain loan factors, such as age of the default, cure rates, size of the loan and estimated change in property value. Reserves are released the month in which a loan in default is brought current by the borrower, which is referred to as a cure. Adjustments to reserve estimates are reflected in the period in which the adjustment is made. Reserves are also ceded to reinsurers under the QSR Transactions, ILN Transactions and XOL Transactions as applicable under each treaty. We have not yet ceded reserves under any of the ILN Transactions or XOL Transactions as incurred claims and claim expenses on each respective reference pool remain within our retained coverage layer for each transaction. 
Our reserve setting process considers the beneficial impact of forbearance, foreclosure moratorium and other assistance programs that may be made available to certain defaulted borrowers. The effectiveness of forbearance and other such assistance programs can be further enhanced by the availability of various repayment and loan modification options which typically allow borrowers to amortize or, in certain instances, outright defer payments otherwise missed during a period of dislocation over an extended length of time. We generally observe that forbearance, repayment and modification, and other assistance programs are an effective tool to bridge dislocated borrowers from a time of acute stress to a future date when they can resume timely payment of their mortgage obligations, and note higher cure rates on defaults benefitting from broad-based assistance programs than would otherwise be expected on similarly situated loans that did not benefit from such programs.
The actual claims we incur as our portfolio matures are difficult to predict and depend on the specific characteristics of our current in-force book (including the credit score and DTI ratio of the borrower, the LTV ratio of the mortgage and geographic 
65
concentrations, among others), as well as the risk profile of new business we write in the future. In addition, claims experience will be affected by macroeconomic factors such as housing prices, interest rates, unemployment rates and other events, such as natural disasters or global pandemics, and any federal, state or local governmental response thereto.
Macroeconomic factors, including persistent inflation, elevated interest rates, flagging consumer confidence and increasing jobless claims could have a pronounced impact on the housing market, the mortgage insurance industry and our business in future periods. A marked decline in housing demand, a significant and protracted decrease in house prices, or a sustained increase in unemployment could contribute to an increase in our future default and claims experience.

The “claims incurred” section of the table above shows claims and claim expenses incurred on defaults occurring in current and prior years, including IBNR reserves and is presented net of reinsurance. We may increase or decrease our claim estimates and reserves as we learn additional information about individual defaulted loans and continue to observe and analyze loss development trends in our portfolio. Gross reserves of $35.0 million related to prior year defaults remained as of December 31, 2024.

(2)    Severity represents the total amount of claims paid including claim expenses divided by the related RIF on the loan at the time the claim is perfected, and is calculated including claims settled without payment.
We paid 276, 199 and 81 claims during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The number of claims paid in each year was modest relative to the size of our insured portfolio and we generally observe that the borrowers of the loans we insure are well-situated with strong credit profiles, stable 30-year fixed rate mortgages, manageable debt service obligations and significant appreciated equity in their homes. An increase in the value of the homes collateralizing the mortgages we insure provides defaulted borrowers with alternative paths and incentives to cure their loan prior to the development of a claim.
Our claims severity for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was 61%, 55% and 49%, respectively. Our claims severity for each year was below long-term industry norms and benefited from the same broad national house price appreciation that supported our claims paid experience. An increase in the value of the homes collateralizing the mortgages we insure provides additional equity support to our risk exposure and raises the prospect of a third-party sale of a foreclosed property, which can mitigate the severity of our settled claims. 
The number of claims paid and our severity experience in future periods may be impacted if developing economic cycles impose financial strain on borrowers, and each could increase if house price declines serve to limit the alternative paths and incentives to cure delinquencies that are available to defaulted borrowers or erode the equity value of the homes collateralizing the mortgages we insure.

(2)    Amount includes claims adjustment expenses. 
Average reserve per default decreased from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024, primarily due to an increase in the proportion of defaults that trace to storm-related activity year-on-year. We generally observe that storm-related defaults cure at higher rates than other similarly situated loans in default (in non-disaster zones) and scale our reserves accordingly. Average reserves per default were further impacted by other changes in the composition of our default inventory, as well as changes in observed and forecasted housing market conditions and macroeconomic factors between the measurement dates.
Average reserve per default increased from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023, primarily due to changes in the composition of our default inventory as measured by the size, vintage and current estimated LTV of defaulted loans, as well as the proportion of such loans benefiting from a forbearance program granted in response to a financial hardship related to COVID-19. Average reserves per default were further impacted by changes in observed and forecasted housing market conditions and macroeconomic factors between the measurement dates.
Seasonality
Historically, our business has been subject to modest seasonality in both NIW production and default experience. Consistent with the seasonality of home sales, purchase origination volumes typically increase in late spring and peak during the summer months, leading to a rise in NIW volume during the second and third quarters of a given year. Refinancing volume, however, does not follow a set seasonal trend and is instead primarily influenced by mortgage rates. Fluctuations in refinancing volume (driven by changes in prevailing mortgage rates) may serve to mute or magnify the seasonal effect of home purchase patterns on mortgage insurance NIW. Default experience is also subject to seasonality due to seasonal patterns in household cash flows, with certain borrowers benefiting from inflows related to bonus payments and tax refunds in the first half of the year and certain borrowers more strained in the second half of the year given the lack of these inflows and increased discretionary spending through the year-end holiday season. Housing market conditions and macroeconomic factors may serve to mute or magnify these seasonal default trends.
GSE Oversight
As an
 approved insurer
, NMIC is subject to ongoing compliance with the PMIERs established by each of the GSEs (
italicized
 terms have the same meaning that such terms have in the PMIERs, as described below). The PMIERs establish operational, business, remedial and financial requirements applicable to
 approved insurers
. The PMIERs financial requirements prescribe a risk-based methodology whereby the amount of assets required to be held against each insured loan is determined based on certain loan-level risk characteristics, such as FICO, vintage (year of origination), performing vs. non-performing (
i.e., 
current vs. delinquent), LTV ratio and other risk features. In general, higher quality loans carry lower asset charges.
Under the PMIERs,
 approved insurers
 must maintain
 available assets
 that equal or exceed
 minimum required assets
, which is an amount equal to the greater of (i) $400 million or (ii) a total 
risk-based required asset 
amount. The
 risk-based required asset 
amount is a function of the risk profile of an
 approved insurer's
 RIF, assessed on a loan-by-loan basis and considered against certain risk-based factors derived from tables set out in the PMIERs, which is then adjusted on an aggregate basis for reinsurance transactions approved by the GSEs, such as with respect to our ILN Transactions, XOL Transactions and QSR Transactions. The
 aggregate gross risk-based required asset 
amount

for performing, primary insurance is subject to a floor of 5.6% of
 performing primary adjusted RIF
.
By April 15th of each year, NMIC must certify it met all PMIERs requirements as of December 31st of the prior year. We certified to the GSEs by April 15, 2024 that NMIC was in full compliance with the PMIERs as of December 31, 2023. NMIC also has an ongoing obligation to immediately notify the GSEs in writing upon discovery of a failure to meet one or more of the PMIERs requirements. We continuously monitor NMIC's compliance with the PMIERs.

available assets
 between the dates presented was primarily driven by NMIC's positive cash flow from operations during the intervening periods, partially offset by the payment of ordinary course dividends from NMIC to NMIH during each year. 
Net
 risk-based required assets 
were

$1.8 billion at December 31, 2024, compared to $1.5 billion at December 31, 2023 and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase in the net r
isk-based required asset 
amount

between the dates presented was primarily due to the growth in our gross RIF and aggregate gross 
risk-based required asset 
amount, partially offset by risk ceded under our third-party reinsurance agreements.
Competition
The MI industry is highly competitive and currently consists of six private mortgage insurers, including NMIC, as well as government MIs such as the FHA, USDA or VA. Private MI companies compete based on service, customer relationships, underwriting and other factors, including price, credit risk tolerance and IT capabilities. We expect the private MI market to remain competitive, with pressure for industry participants to maintain or grow their market share.
The private MI industry overall competes more broadly with government MIs who significantly increased their share in the MI market following the 2008 Financial Crisis. Although there has been broad policy consensus toward the need for increasing private capital participation and decreasing government exposure to credit risk in the U.S. housing finance system, it remains difficult to predict whether the combined market share of government MIs will recede to pre-2008 levels. A range of factors influence a lender's and borrower's decision to choose private over government MI, including among others, premium rates and other charges, loan eligibility requirements, the cancelability of private coverage, loan size limits and the relative ease of use of private MI products compared to government MI alternatives.
Cybersecurity
We rely on technology to engage with customers, access borrower information and deliver our products and services. We have established and implemented security measures, controls and procedures to safeguard our IT systems, and prevent and detect unauthorized access to such systems or any data processed and/or stored therein. We periodically engage third parties to evaluate and test the adequacy of such security measures, controls and procedures. In addition, we have a business continuity plan that is designed to mitigate the operational impact of certain disruptive events, including disruptions to our IT systems, and we have an incident response plan that is designed to address information security incidents, including any breaches of our IT systems. Despite these safeguards, disruptions to and breaches of our IT systems are possible and may negatively impact our business.
We maintain a cybersecurity errors and omissions insurance policy to limit our exposure to loss in the event of an incident. This policy provides coverage for (i) claims related to, among other things, unauthorized network or computer access, unintentional disclosure or misuse of personally identifiable information in our possession, and unintentional failure to disclose a breach, and (ii) certain costs related to privacy notification, crisis management, cyber extortion, data recovery, business interruption and reputational harm.

Revenues
Net premiums earned increased sequentially during each successive year, primarily driven by growth in our monthly IIF and monthly pay premium receipts, partially offset by a decline in the contribution from single premium policy cancellations. Net premiums earned for the year ended December 31, 2024 further benefited from a year-on-year decline in the total premiums ceded under our reinsurance treaties.
70
Net investment income increased sequentially during each successive year, primarily driven by an increase in the book yield of our investment portfolio tied to the deployment of new cash flows and reinvestment of rolling maturities at incrementally higher rates, as well as growth in the size of our total invested asset base.
Other revenues represent underwriting fee revenue generated by our subsidiary, NMIS, which provides outsourced loan review services to mortgage loan originators. Changes in other revenues primarily reflect changes in NMIS' outsourced loan review volume. Amounts recognized in other revenues generally correspond with amounts incurred as service expenses for outsourced loan review activities in the same periods.

Expenses
We recognize insurance claims and claim expenses in connection with the loss experience of our insured portfolio and incur other underwriting and operating expenses, including employee compensation and benefits, policy acquisition costs, and technology, professional services and facilities expenses, in connection with the development and operation of our business. We also incur service expenses in connection with NMIS' outsourced loan review activities.
Insurance claims and claim expenses increased during each successive year, primarily driven by an increase in the number of newly defaulted loans that emerged in each successive period and the establishment of initial reserves against such loans, as well as an increase in the average case reserve held against previously defaulted loans that aged in their delinquency status through the periods, and was partially offset by the release of a portion of the reserves we established for anticipated claims payments in prior periods in connection with cure activity and ongoing analysis of recent loss development trends.
Underwriting and operating expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily reflecting an increase in employee compensation costs and an adjustment to the pace of amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, partially offset by an increase in ceding commissions received under our QSR Transactions and a decline in certain technology expenses.
The decline in underwriting and operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily reflected a decrease in the amortization of deferred acquisition costs tied to the increased persistency of our IIF during the period and a full-year impact of ceding commissions received in connection with the 2022 Seasoned QSR Transaction (which was in effect for only a portion of the year ended December 31, 2022), partially offset by an increase in employee compensation costs.
Service expenses represent third-party costs incurred by NMIS in connection with the services it provides. Changes in service expenses primarily reflect changes in NMIS' outsourced loan review volume. Amounts incurred as service expenses generally correspond with amounts recognized in other revenues in the same periods.
Interest expense primarily reflects the carrying costs of the notes. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 includes $7.0 million of non-recurring costs related to the refinancing of the 2020 Notes and 2021 Revolving Credit Facility with the 2024 Notes and 2024 Revolving Credit Facility. For further information, see Item 8, “
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 5, Debt.
”
Income tax expense increased sequentially during each successive year and was primarily driven by the growth in our pre-tax income. As a U.S. taxpayer, we are subject to a U.S. federal corporate income tax rate of 21%. Our effective income tax rate on pre-tax income was 22.3%, 22.0% and 22.4% for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our effective tax rate increased for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to the limitation on deductible compensation for covered employees under Section 162(m) of the IRC. Our effective tax rate decreased for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to an increase in the tax benefit realized from excess share-based compensation for stock options exercised in the period. For further information regarding income taxes and their impact on our results of operations and financial position, see Item 8, “
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 11, Income Taxes.
”
Net Income
Net income and adjusted net income increased in each successive year primarily due to growth in our total revenues, partially offset by increases in our insurance claims and claim expenses and income tax expenses. The sequential trends in net income and adjusted net income were further impacted by changes in underwriting and operating expenses. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2024 includes non-recurring costs incurred in connection with the refinancing of the 2020 Notes and 2021 Revolving Credit Facility; such amounts are excluded from the calculation of adjusted net income.
71
Diluted and adjusted diluted EPS increased during each successive year primarily due to growth in our net income and adjusted net income, as well as a decline in the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding tied to share repurchase activity.
The non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted income before tax, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS are presented to enhance the comparability of financial results between periods.

Explanation and Reconciliation of Our Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We believe the use of the non-GAAP measures of adjusted income before tax, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS enhances the comparability of our fundamental financial performance between periods, and provides relevant information to investors. These non-GAAP financial measures align with the way the company's business performance is evaluated by management. These measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as alternatives to GAAP measures of performance. These measures have been presented to increase transparency and enhance the comparability of our fundamental operating trends across periods. Other companies may calculate these measures differently; their measures may not be comparable to those we calculate and present. 
Adjusted income before tax
 is defined as GAAP income before tax, excluding the pre-tax effects of net realized gains or losses from our investment portfolio, the gain or loss related to the change in fair value of our warrant liability, periodic costs incurred in connection with capital markets transactions, and other infrequent, unusual or non-operating items in the periods in which such items are incurred.
Adjusted net income
 is defined as GAAP net income, excluding the after-tax effects of net realized gains or losses from our investment portfolio, the gain or loss related to the change in fair value of our warrant liability, periodic costs incurred in connection with capital markets transactions, and other infrequent, unusual or non-operating items in the periods in which such items are incurred. Adjustments to components of pre-tax income are tax effected using the applicable federal statutory tax rate for the respective periods.
72
Adjusted diluted EPS
 is defined as adjusted net income divided by adjusted weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Adjusted weighted average diluted shares outstanding is defined as weighted average diluted shares outstanding, adjusted for changes in the dilutive effect of non-vested shares that would otherwise have occurred had GAAP net income been calculated in accordance with adjusted net income. There will be no adjustment to weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the years that non-vested shares are anti-dilutive under GAAP.
Although adjusted income before tax, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS exclude certain items that have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future, the excluded items: (1) are not viewed as part of the operating performance of our primary activities; or (2) are impacted by market, economic or regulatory factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends, or both. These adjustments, and the reasons for their treatment, are described below.
•
Net realized investment gains and losses
. The recognition of net realized investment gains or losses can vary significantly across periods as the timing is highly discretionary and is influenced by factors such as market opportunities, tax and capital profile, and overall market cycles that do not reflect our current period operating results.
•
Change in fair value of warrant liability
. Outstanding warrants at the end of each reporting period are revalued, and any change in fair value is reported in the statement of operations in the period in which the change occurred. The change in fair value of our warrant liability can vary significantly across periods and is influenced principally by equity market and general economic factors that do not impact or reflect our current period operating results. Furthermore, all unexercised warrants expired in April 2022 and, as such, no change in fair value has been recognized in any reporting periods thereafter. We believe trends in our operating performance can be more clearly identified by excluding fluctuations related to the change in fair value of our warrant liability.
•
Capital markets transaction costs
. Capital markets transaction costs result from activities that are undertaken to improve our debt profile or enhance our capital position through activities such as debt refinancing and capital markets reinsurance transactions that may vary in their size and timing due to factors such as market opportunities, tax and capital profile, and overall market cycles.
•
Other infrequent, unusual or non-operating items
. Items that are the result of unforeseen or uncommon events, and are not expected to recur with frequency in the future. Identification and exclusion of these items provides clarity about the impact special or rare occurrences may have on our current financial performance. Past adjustments under this category include infrequent, unusual or non-operating adjustments related to severance, restricted stock modification and other expenses incurred in connection with the CEO transition announced in September 2021 and the effects of the release of the valuation allowance recorded against our net federal and certain state net deferred tax assets in 2016 and the re-measurement of our net deferred tax assets in connection with tax reform in 2017. We believe such items are infrequent or non-recurring in nature, and are not indicative of the performance of, or ongoing trends in, our primary operating activities or business.

Total cash and investments increased due to the addition of incremental cash provided by operating activities and a decrease in the unrealized loss position of our fixed income portfolio primarily tied to changes in interest rates, partially offset by share repurchase activity during the year ended December 31, 2024. Cash and investments at December 31, 2024 included $132.2 million held by NMIH.
Net premiums receivable represents premiums due on our mortgage insurance policies and may fluctuate based on changes in our monthly premium policies in force, where premiums are generally paid one month in arrears, and the pace of settlement of previously outstanding receivables.
Net software and equipment decreased due to a step-down in capitalized costs related to our agreement with TCS.
Net deferred policy acquisition costs increased due to the deferral of certain costs associated with the origination of new policies between the respective balance sheet dates and was partially offset by the recognition of previously deferred policy acquisition costs.
Reinsurance recoverable increased year-on-year as a result of an increase in ceded losses recoverable under our QSR Transactions.
Prepaid federal income taxes increased due to the purchase of $86.9 million of tax and loss bonds during the year ended December 31, 2024. For further information, see Item 8, “
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 11, Income Taxes.
” 
Other assets increased primarily driven by an increase in accrued investment income and the capitalization of deferred debt issuance costs incurred in connection with the establishment of the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility, partially offset by a reduction in our right-of-use (ROU) assets tied to the amortization of the operating lease for our corporate headquarters.
Debt as of December 31, 2024 represented the carrying value of the $425 million aggregate principal amount 2024 Notes, which were issued in May 2024. Debt as of December 31, 2023 represented the carrying value of the $400 million aggregate principal amount 2020 Notes, which were redeemed in full upon the completion of the 2024 Notes offering. For further information, see Item 8, “
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 5, Debt.
”
74
Unearned premiums decreased driven by the amortization of existing unearned premiums through earnings in accordance with the expiration of risk on related single premium policies and the cancellations of other single premium policies, partially offset by single premium policy originations during the year ended December 31, 2024.
Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased primarily due to accrued and unpaid interest on the 2024 Notes, which is payable semi-annually beginning in February 2025, as well as an increase in reinsurance premiums payable, partially offset by the settlement of certain contractual payables during the year ended December 31, 2024.
Reserve for insurance claims and claim expenses increased in connection with the establishment of initial reserves on newly defaulted loans during the year ended December 31, 2024, as well as an increase in the average case reserve held against previously defaulted loans that have aged in their delinquency status. The increase in the reserves for insurance claims and claim expenses was partially offset by the release of a portion of the reserves we established for anticipated claims payments in prior periods (in connection with cure activity and ongoing analysis of recent loss development trends), as well as the payment of previously reserved claims during the period. See “
Insurance Claims and Claim Expenses
,” above

for further details.
Net deferred tax liability increased due to an increase in the claimed deductibility of our statutory contingency reserve, as well as a decrease in the aggregate unrealized loss position of our fixed income portfolio recorded in other comprehensive income. For further information regarding income taxes and their impact on our results of operations and financial position, see Item 8, “
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 11, Income Taxes.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased in each successive year primarily due to an increase in our net premium receipts and growth in our investment income, partially offset by an increase in the purchase of tax and loss bonds from period-to-period. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2024, was further impacted by an increase in cash taxes paid and the settlement of previously accrued short-term employee incentive awards. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023, was also impacted by a decline in short-term employee incentive payments.
Cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 reflects the purchase of fixed and short-term maturities with cash provided by operating activities, and the reinvestment of coupon payments, maturities and redemption proceeds within our investment portfolio.
Cash used in financing activities primarily relates to the repurchase of common stock and taxes paid on the net share settlement of equity awards for certain employees. Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 further reflects the net impact of the redemption of the 2020 Notes and issuance of the 2024 Notes during the period.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
NMIH serves as the holding company for our insurance subsidiaries and does not have any significant operations of its own. NMIH's principal liquidity demands include funds for (i) payment of certain corporate expenses; (ii) payment of certain reimbursable expenses of its insurance subsidiaries; (iii) payment of the interest related to the 2024 Notes and 2024 Revolving Credit Facility; (iv) tax payments to the Internal Revenue Service; (v) capital support for its subsidiaries; (vi) repurchase of its common stock; and (vii) payment of dividends, if any, on its common stock. NMIH is not subject to any limitations on its ability to pay dividends except those generally applicable to corporations that are incorporated in Delaware. Delaware law provides that dividends are only payable out of a corporation's surplus or recent net profits (subject to certain limitations).
75
As of December 31, 2024, NMIH had $132.2 million of cash and investments. NMIH's principal sources of net cash are dividends from its subsidiaries and investment income. NMIC has the capacity to pay aggregate ordinary dividends of $98.4 million to NMIH during the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2025. NMIH also has access to $250 million of undrawn revolving credit capacity under the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility.
On February 10, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a $125 million share repurchase program (excluding associated costs and applicable taxes, the 2022 Repurchase Program) effective through December 31, 2023. On July 31, 2023, our Board of Directors authorized a $200 million share repurchase program (excluding associated costs and applicable taxes, the 2023 Repurchase Program) effective through December 31, 2025 and extended the 2022 Repurchase Program through December 31, 2025 to align its remaining tenor with that of the 2023 Repurchase Program.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, NMIH repurchased 2.8 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $97.7 million, including associated costs and applicable taxes. As of December 31, 2024, NMIH had $80.1 million of repurchase authority remaining.
On February 5, 2025, our Board of Directors authorized a new $250 million share repurchase program (excluding associated costs and applicable taxes, the 2025 Repurchase Program) effective through December 31, 2027. The authorization provides us the flexibility, based on market and business conditions, stock price and other factors, to repurchase stock from time to time through open market repurchases, privately negotiated transactions, or other means, including pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. Concurrent with the new authorization, our Board of Directors also approved an extension of our existing share repurchase programs through December 31, 2027 to align its remaining tenor with that of the new $250 million program.
On May 21, 2024, NMIH completed the $425 million sale of the 2024 Notes, raising net proceeds of $414.1 million after giving effect to offering expenses and an initial underwriting discount. Net proceeds from the offering were primarily used to effect the redemption of the $400 million aggregate principal amount 2020 Notes. In June 2024, NMIH contributed remaining net proceeds of the offering to NMIC. For more information, see Item 8, “
Financial Statements - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 5, Debt.
”
NMIH has entered into tax and expense-sharing agreements with its subsidiaries which have been approved by the Wisconsin OCI, with such approvals subject to change or revocation at any time. Among such agreements, the Wisconsin OCI has approved the allocation of interest expense on the 2024 Notes and 2024 Revolving Credit Facility to NMIC, to the extent proceeds from such offering and facility are contributed to NMIC or used to repay, redeem or otherwise defease amounts raised by NMIC under prior credit arrangements that have previously been distributed to NMIC.
The 2024 Notes mature on August 15, 2029 and bear interest at a rate of 6.00%, payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15. The 2024 Revolving Credit Facility matures on May 21, 2029, and accrues interest at a variable rate equal to, at our discretion, (i) a Base Rate (as defined in the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility, subject to a floor of 1.00% per annum) plus a margin of 0.375% to 1.875% per annum, or (ii) the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility) plus a margin of 1.375% to 2.875% per annum, with the margin in each of (i) or (ii) based on our applicable corporate credit rating at the time. Borrowings under the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including to support the growth of our new business production and operations.
Under the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility, NMIH is required to pay a quarterly commitment fee on the average daily undrawn amount of 0.175% to 0.525%, based on the applicable corporate credit rating at the time. As of December 31, 2024, the applicable commitment fee was 0.225%.
We are subject to certain covenants under the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility. Under the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility, NMIH may not permit (i) our debt to total capitalization ratio to exceed 35% as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, or (ii) our consolidated net worth to be, as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, less than the sum of (A) $1,489,742,100, plus (B) 50% of our cumulative consolidated net income for each fiscal quarter for which such consolidated net income is positive, plus (C) 50% of any increase in our consolidated net worth after March 31, 2024 resulting from certain issuances of equity by or capital contributions to NMIH or our subsidiaries. In addition, NMIC must remain at all times in compliance with all applicable “financial requirements” imposed pursuant to the PMIERs, subject to any allowed transition period or forbearance thereunder. The credit agreement for 2024 Revolving Credit Facility also prohibits, restricts or limits, among other things, NMIH's and its subsidiaries' ability to (i) incur additional indebtedness, (ii) incur liens on their property, (iii) pay dividends or make other distributions, (iv) sell their assets, (v) make certain loans or investments, (vi) merge or consolidate and (vii) enter into transactions with affiliates, in each case subject to certain limitations, exceptions and qualifications as set forth in the credit agreement for 2024 Revolving Credit Facility. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2024.
NMIC and Re One are subject to certain capital and dividend rules and regulations prescribed by jurisdictions in which 
76
they are authorized to operate and by the GSEs. Under Wisconsin insurance laws, NMIC and Re One may pay dividends up to specified levels (i.e., “ordinary” dividends) with 30 days' prior notice to the Wisconsin OCI. Dividends in larger amounts, or “extraordinary” dividends, are subject to the Wisconsin OCI's prior approval. Under Wisconsin insurance laws, an extraordinary dividend is defined as any payment or distribution that, together with other dividends and distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the lesser of (i) 10% of the insurer's statutory policyholders' surplus as of the preceding December 31 or (ii) adjusted statutory net income for the twelve-month period ending the preceding December 31. During the year ended December 31, 2024, NMIC paid a $96.3 million ordinary course dividend to NMIH. NMIC has the capacity to pay aggregate ordinary dividends of $98.4 million to NMIH during the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2025.
As an 
approved insurer
 under PMIERs, NMIC would generally be subject to additional restrictions on its ability to pay dividends to NMIH if it failed to meet the financial requirements prescribed by PMIERs. Approved insurers that fail to meet the prescribed PMIERs financial requirements are not permitted to pay dividends without prior approval from the GSEs.
NMIH may require liquidity to fund the capital needs of its insurance subsidiaries. NMIC’s capital needs depend on many factors including its ability to successfully write new business, establish premium rates at levels sufficient to cover claims and operating costs, access the reinsurance markets and meet 
minimum required asset
 thresholds under the PMIERs and minimum state capital requirements (respectively, as defined therein).
As an approved mortgage insurer and Wisconsin-domiciled carrier, NMIC is required to satisfy financial and/or capitalization requirements stipulated by each of the GSEs and the Wisconsin OCI. The financial requirements stipulated by the GSEs are outlined in the PMIERs. Under the PMIERs, NMIC must maintain available assets that are equal to or exceed a minimum 
risk-based required asset 
amount, subject to a minimum floor of $400 million.
The 
risk-based required asset 
amount under PMIERs is determined at an individual policy-level based on the risk characteristics of each insured loan. Loans with higher risk factors, such as higher LTVs or lower borrower FICO scores, are assessed a higher charge. Non-performing loans that have missed two or more payments are generally assessed a significantly higher charge than performing loans, regardless of the underlying borrower or loan risk profile; however, special consideration is given under PMIERs to loans that are delinquent on homes located in an area declared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to be a Major Disaster zone eligible for Individual Assistance.
NMIC’s PMIERs minimum 
risk-based required asset 
amount is also adjusted for its reinsurance transactions (as approved by the GSEs). Under NMIC’s quota share reinsurance treaties, it receives credit for the PMIERs 
risk-based required asset 
amount on ceded RIF. As its gross PMIERs 
risk-based required asset 
amount on ceded RIF increases, the PMIERs credit for ceded RIF automatically increases as well (in an unlimited amount). Under NMIC’s ILN and XOL Transactions, it generally receives credit for the PMIERs 
risk-based required asset 
amount on ceded RIF to the extent such requirement is within the subordinated coverage (excess of loss detachment threshold) afforded by the transaction.
On August 21, 2024, the GSEs and FHFA updated PMIERs to revise the Available Asset credit mortgage insurers will receive for certain assets based on several factors, including asset class and credit rating. The updated PMIERs will take effect on a phased basis beginning March 31, 2025 and will be fully implemented on September 30, 2026. We do not expect the updated PMIERs to have a material impact on our 
available assets
 and 
risk-based required assets
, and we expect to remain in full compliance with the existing and updated PMIERs, as applicable, prior to, on and after March 31, 2025.
NMIC is also subject to state regulatory minimum capital requirements based on its RIF. Formulations of this minimum capital vary by state, however, the most common measure allows for a maximum ratio of RIF to statutory capital (commonly referred to as RTC) of 25:1. The RTC calculation does not assess a different charge or impose a different threshold RTC limit based on the underlying risk characteristics of the insured portfolio. Non-performing loans are treated the same as performing loans under the RTC framework. As such, the PMIERs generally imposes a stricter financial requirement than the state RTC standard.
As of December 31, 2024, NMIC had a RTC ratio of 12.7:1 with $36.6 billion of performing primary RIF, net of reinsurance, and $2.9 billion of total statutory capital, including contingency reserves. Re One has no risk in force remaining and no longer reports a RTC ratio.
NMIC’s principal sources of liquidity include (i) premium receipts on its insured portfolio and new business production, (ii) interest income on its investment portfolio and principal repayments on maturities therein, and (iii) existing cash and cash equivalent holdings. At December 31, 2024, NMIC had $2.6 billion of cash and investments, including $10.2 million of cash and cash equivalents. NMIC's principal liquidity demands include funds for the payment of (i) reimbursable holding company expenses, (ii) premiums ceded under our reinsurance transactions (iii) claims payments, and (iv) taxes as due or otherwise 
77
deferred through the purchase of tax and loss bonds. NMIC’s cash inflow is generally significantly in excess of its cash outflow in any given period. During the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2024, NMIC generated $366 million of cash flow from operations and received an additional $229 million of cash flow on the maturity and redemption of securities held in its investment portfolio. NMIC is not a party to any contracts (derivative or otherwise) that require it to post an increasing amount of collateral to any counterparty and NMIC’s principal liquidity demands (other than claims payments) generally develop along a scheduled path (
i.e.
, are of a contractually predetermined amount and due at a contractually predetermined date). NMIC’s only use of cash with the potential to develop along an unscheduled path is claims payments. Given the relatively small size of our current population of defaulted policies, the generally extended duration of the default-to-foreclosure-to-claim cycle, and the potential availability of forbearance, foreclosure moratorium and other borrower assistance programs (which serve to further extend the default-to-foreclosure-to-claim cycle timeline), we do not expect NMIC to use a meaningful amount of cash to settle claims in the near-term.
Debt and Financial Strength Ratings
NMIC’s financial strength is rated “A-” by Fitch Ratings (Fitch), “A3” by Moody’s, and “A-” by S&P. NMIH’s 2024 Notes are rated “BBB-” by Fitch and “Baa3” by Moody’s. In January 2025, Fitch revised the outlook for all its ratings from stable to positive. The outlook for all ratings provided by Moody’s and S&P is stable.
Consolidated Investment Portfolio
The primary objectives of our investment activity are to generate investment income and preserve capital, while maintaining sufficient liquidity to cover our operating needs. We aim to achieve diversification by type, quality, maturity, and industry. We have adopted an investment policy that defines, among other things, eligible and ineligible investments; concentration limits for asset types, industry sectors, single issuers, and certain credit ratings; and benchmarks for asset duration.
Our investment portfolio is comprised entirely of fixed maturity instruments. As of December 31, 2024, the fair value of our investment portfolio was $2.7 billion and we held an additional $54.3 million of cash and cash equivalents. Pre-tax book yield on the investment portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2024 was 3.0%. Book yield is calculated as period-to-date net investment income divided by the average amortized cost of the investment portfolio. The yield on our investment portfolio is likely to change over time based on movements in interest rates, credit spreads, the duration or mix of our holdings and other factors.

Investment Securities - Allowance for credit losses
We did not recognize an allowance for credit loss for any security in the investment portfolio as of December 31, 2024 or 2023, and we did not record any provision for credit loss for investment securities during the years ended December 31, 2024 or 2023. 
 As of December 31, 2024, the investment portfolio had gross unrealized losses of $158.6 million, of which $150.8 million were associated with securities that had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of twelve months or longer. As of December 31, 2023, the investment portfolio had gross unrealized losses of $184.3 million, of which $183.1 million were associated with securities that had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of twelve months or longer. 
We evaluated the securities in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2024, assessing their credit ratings as well as any adverse conditions specifically related to the security. Based upon our assessment of the amount and timing of cash flows to be collected over the remaining life of each instrument, we believe the unrealized losses as of December 31, 2024 are not indicative of the ultimate collectability of the current amortized cost of the securities. Rather, the unrealized losses on securities held as of December 31, 2024 were primarily driven by fluctuations in interest rates, and to a lesser extent, movements in credit spreads following the purchase of those securities.
Taxes
We are a U.S. taxpayer and are subject to a statutory U.S. federal corporate income tax rate of 21%. Our holding company files a consolidated U.S. federal and various state income tax returns on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries.
Our effective income tax rate on pre-tax income was 22.3%, 22.0% and 22.4% for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our effective income tax rate may vary from the statutory tax rate in a given period due to the inclusions and exclusions of income and deductions for tax purposes. Inclusions of tax deductions may include tax benefits from excess share-based compensation for vested RSUs and exercised stock options; and exclusions from income may include the fair value fluctuation of our warrant liability.
At December 31, 2024, we had a federal net operating loss carryforward of $1.0 million, which expire in varying amounts in 2030 and 2031, and state net operating loss carryforwards of $135.2 million, which begin to expire in varying amounts in 2032. Our ability to utilize our remaining federal net operating loss carryforward is restricted by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), which imposes annual limitations if there is an “ownership change.” As a result of the acquisition of our insurance subsidiaries in 2012, $7.3 million of federal net operating losses were subject to annual limitations of $0.8 million through 2016, $0.5 million in 2017 and $0.3 million, thereafter, through 2028. Our remaining federal net operating loss carryforward balance is a result of this limitation.
As a mortgage guaranty insurance company, we are eligible to claim a tax deduction for our statutory contingency reserve balance, subject to certain limitations outlined under Section 832(e) of the IRC, and only to the extent we acquire tax and loss bonds in an amount equal to the tax benefit derived from the claimed deduction. As of December 31, 2024, we held $322.2 million of tax and loss bonds in “
Prepaid Federal Income Taxes”
 on our consolidated balance sheets.
We record a valuation allowance against the state net operating losses generated by NMIH as NMIH has historically operated at a loss, and we do not expect to utilize such net deferred tax assets in the future. We continue to evaluate the realizability of our state net deferred tax asset position, and our examination of results through December 31, 2024 and review of future expectations support the continued application of a valuation allowance against such state net deferred tax assets.
NMIH and its subsidiaries entered into a tax sharing agreement effective August 23, 2012, which was subsequently amended on September 1, 2016. Under original and amended agreements, each of the parties agreed to file consolidated federal income tax returns for all tax years beginning in and subsequent to 2012, with NMIH as the direct tax filer. The tax liability of each subsidiary that is party to the agreement is limited to the amount of the liability it would incur if it filed separate returns.
The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) enacted in August 2022 imposed, among other provisions, a 1% excise tax on the net value of stock repurchases made on or after January 1, 2023. As of December 31, 2024, $80.1 million of repurchase authority remained available under the share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors through December 31, 2025. We expect future repurchase amounts will be subject to the IRA excise tax as executed; however, we do not currently expect the excise tax or other provisions of the IRA to have a material impact on our financial condition or result of operations.

Critical Accounting Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with GAAP. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, management has made estimates and assumptions, and applied judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. As a result, actual results could differ materially from those estimates. A summary of the accounting estimates that management believes are critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is set forth below.
Insurance Premium Revenue Recognition
Premiums for primary mortgage insurance policies may be paid in a single payment at origination (single premium), on a monthly installment basis (monthly premium) or on an annual installment basis (annual premium), with such election and payment type fixed at policy inception. Premiums written at origination for single premium policies are initially deferred as unearned premiums and amortized into earnings over the estimated policy life in accordance with the anticipated expiration of risk, which is primarily derived from the term of the mortgage loans, original LTV and the interest rate for each individual policy. Monthly premiums are recognized as revenue in the month billed and when coverage is effective. Annual premiums are initially deferred and earned on a straight-line basis over the year of coverage. Upon cancellation of a policy, all remaining non-refundable deferred and unearned premium is immediately earned, and any refundable deferred and unearned premium is returned to the policyholder and recorded as a reduction to written premium and unearned premium reserve in the period paid.
Reserve for Insurance Claims and Claim Expenses
We establish reserves for claims based on our best estimate of the ultimate claim costs for defaulted loans using the general principles contained in ASC 944, Financial Services - Insurance (ASC 944). A loan is considered to be in “default” as of the payment date at which a borrower has missed the preceding two or more consecutive monthly payments. We establish reserves for loans that have been reported to us in default by servicers, referred to as case reserves, and additional loans that we estimate (based on actuarial review and other factors) to be in default that have not yet been reported to us by servicers, referred to as IBNR reserves. We also establish reserves for claim expenses, which represent the estimated cost of the claim administration process, including legal and other fees, as well as other general expenses of administering the claim settlement process.

Claim expense reserves are either allocated (
i.e.
, associated with a specific claim) or unallocated (
i.e.
, not associated with a specific claim). 
The establishment of claims and claim expense reserves is subject to inherent uncertainty and requires significant judgment by management.

Reserves are established by estimating the number of loans in default that will result in a claim payment, which is referred to as claim frequency, and the amount of claim payment expected to be paid on each such loan in default, which is referred to as claim severity. Claim frequency and severity estimates are established based on historical observed experience regarding certain loan factors, such as age of the default, size of the loan and LTV ratios, and are strongly influenced by assumptions about the path of certain economic factors, such as house price appreciation, trends in unemployment and mortgage rates.

We consider the appropriateness of such inputs at each fiscal quarter and conduct an actuarial review annually to evaluate and, if necessary, update these assumptions. 
It is possible that a relatively small change in our estimates for claim frequency or claim severity could have a material impact on our reserve position and our consolidated results of operations, even in a stable macroeconomic environment. At December 31, 2024, assuming all other estimates remain constant, a one percentage point increase/decrease in our average claim severity factor would cause approximately a +/- $1.4 million change in our reserve position, and a one percentage point increase/decrease in our average claim frequency factor cause approximately a +/- $4.8 million change in our reserve position.
Investments - Credit losses and Other Impairments
We have designated our investment portfolio as available-for-sale and report our invested assets at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses in the portfolio, net of related tax expense or benefit, are recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) in shareholders' equity. 
Purchases and sales of investments are recorded on a trade date basis. Net investment income is recognized when earned, and includes interest and dividend income together with amortization of market premiums and discounts using the effective yield method, and is net of investment management fees and other investment related expenses. For asset-backed securities and any other holdings for which there is a prepayment risk, prepayment assumptions are evaluated and revised as necessary. Any adjustments required due to changes in effective yields and prepayment assumptions are recognized on a prospective basis.
80
We recognize an impairment on a security through the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income if (i) we intend to sell the impaired security; or (ii) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the impaired security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis. If a sale is intended or likely to be required, we write down the amortized cost basis of the security to fair value and recognize the full amount of the impairment through the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income as a “
Realized Investment Loss.”
For securities in an unrealized loss position where a sale is not intended or likely to be required, we further assess if the decline in fair value below amortized cost is driven by a credit related impairment, considering several items including, but not limited to:
•
the severity of the decline in fair value;
•
the financial condition of the issuer;
•
the failure of the issuer to make scheduled interest or principal payments;
•
recent rating downgrades of the applicable security or issuer by one or more nationally recognized statistical ratings organization; and
•
other adverse conditions related to or impacting the security or issuer.
To the extent we determine that a security impairment is credit-related, an impairment loss is recognized through the statement of operations as a provision for credit loss expense, and presented as a “Realized Investment Loss.” We recognize an allowance for credit losses for the difference between the amortized cost and present value of future expected cash flows, limited by the amount the fair value of the security is below its amortized cost. Subsequent changes (favorable and unfavorable) in credit losses are recognized through the statement of operations as a provision for or a reversal of credit loss expense, and presented as a “Realized Investment Gain or Loss.” The portion of a security impairment attributed to other non-credit related factors is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of taxes.
Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs (DAC)
Costs directly associated with the successful acquisition of mortgage insurance policies, consisting of certain selling expenses and other policy issuance and underwriting expenses, are initially deferred and reported as DAC. DAC is reviewed periodically to determine that it does not exceed recoverable amounts. DAC is amortized to expense in proportion to estimated gross profits over the life of the associated policies. We revise the rate of amortization to reflect actual experience and changes to our persistency or loss development assumptions, and may accelerate or slow such rate in future periods as experience and future changes to estimates dictate. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we slowed the rate and recognized a reduction of DAC amortization by $1.3 million and $7.3 million, respectively, due to the elevated persistency of certain prior book years' insurance in-force tied to a slowdown in the pace of mortgage refinancing activity in connection with the prevailing interest and mortgage rate environment.
81
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We own and manage a large investment portfolio of various holdings, types and maturities. NMIH's principal source of operating cash is investment income. The assets within the investment portfolio are exposed to the same factors that affect overall financial market performance.
We manage market risk via a defined investment policy implemented by our treasury function with oversight from our Board's Risk Committee. Important drivers of our market risk exposure monitored and managed by us include but are not limited to:
•
Changes to the level of interest rates
. Increasing interest rates may reduce the value of certain fixed-rate bonds held in the investment portfolio. Higher rates may cause variable rate assets to generate additional income. Decreasing rates will have the reverse impact. Significant changes in interest rates can also affect persistency and claim rates of our insurance portfolio, and as a result we may determine that our investment portfolio needs to be restructured to better align it with future liabilities and claim payments. Such restructuring may cause investments to be liquidated when market conditions are adverse. Additionally, the changes in SOFR based interest rates affect the interest expense related to the Company's debt. 
•
Changes to the term structure of interest rates
. Rising or falling rates typically change by different amounts along the yield curve. These changes may have unforeseen impacts on the value of certain assets.
•
Market volatility/changes in the real or perceived credit quality of investments
. Deterioration in the quality of investments, identified through changes to our own or third-party (
e.g.
, rating agency or investment advisors) assessments, will reduce the value and potentially the liquidity of investments.
•
Concentration risk
. If the investment portfolio is highly concentrated in one asset, or in multiple assets whose values are highly correlated, the value of the total portfolio may be greatly affected by the change in value of just one asset or a group of highly correlated assets. 
•
Prepayment risk
. Bonds may have call provisions that permit debtors to repay prior to maturity when it is to their advantage. This typically occurs when rates fall below the interest rate of the debt.
The carrying value of our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $2.7 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, of which 100% was invested in fixed maturity securities. The primary market risk to our investment portfolio is interest rate risk associated with investments in fixed maturity securities. We mitigate the market risk associated with our fixed maturity securities portfolio by matching the duration of our fixed maturity securities with the expected duration of the liabilities that those securities are intended to support.
As of December 31, 2024, the duration of our fixed income portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents, was 3.57 years, which means that an instantaneous parallel shift (movement up or down) in the yield curve of 100 basis points would result in a change of 3.57% in fair value of our fixed income portfolio. Excluding cash, our fixed income portfolio duration was 3.57 years, which means that an instantaneous parallel shift (movement up or down) in the yield curve of 100 basis points would result in a change of 3.57% in fair value of our fixed income portfolio.
We are also subject to market risk related to the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility and the ILN Transactions. As discussed in Item 8, “
Financial Statements - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 5, Debt”
 the 
2024 Revolving Credit Facility
 bears interest at a variable rate and, as a result, increases in market interest rates would generally result in increased interest expense on our outstanding drawn balance.
The risk premium amounts under the ILN Transactions are calculated by multiplying the outstanding reinsurance coverage amount at the beginning of any payment period by a coupon rate, which is the sum of one-month SOFR, as applicable, and a risk margin, and then subtracting actual investment income earned on the trust balance during that payment period. An increase in one-month SOFR, as applicable, would generally increase the risk premium payments, while an increase to money market rates, which directly affect investment income earned on the trust balance, would generally decrease them. Although we expect the two rates to move in tandem, to the extent they do not, it could increase or decrease the risk premium payments that otherwise would be due.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Shareholders and Board of Directors of NMI Holdings, Inc.
NMI Holdings, Inc.
Emeryville, California
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NMI Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statements schedules listed in the accompanying index appearing under Part IV, Item 15 – Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) and our report dated February 14, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Reserve for Insurance Claims and Claim Expenses
As described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated reserve for insurance claims and claim expenses balance was $152.1 million at December 31, 2024. As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the establishment of the insurance claims and claim expenses reserve is subject to inherent uncertainty and requires significant judgment by management. The insurance claims reserve is established by estimating: (i) claim frequency which is the number of loans in default expected to result in a claim payment and (ii) claim severity which is the amount of the claim payment expected to be paid on each loan in default. The claim frequency and claim severity are determined based on historical experience regarding certain loan factors and are also strongly influenced by current and expected economic conditions including the housing market.
84
We identified the Company’s estimation of the reserve for insurance claims within the reserve for insurance claims and claim expenses as a critical audit matter. The principal consideration for our determination is the high degree of subjectivity in estimating claim frequency and claim severity. Estimation of these factors is inherently subjective as it requires the Company to make assumptions with respect to the future of the housing market. Auditing these elements involved especially challenging auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of audit effort required to address these matters, including the extent of specialized skill and knowledge needed.
The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:
•
Testing the design and effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company’s valuation of reserve for insurance claims, including automated application controls over the source data utilized in the development of significant assumptions.
•
Testing a sample of the underlying loans and claims data used in management’s insurance claims reserve calculations, which supported estimates of claim frequency and claim severity, by agreeing key characteristics of the underlying loans and claims data to source documents and data provided by third party loan servicers. 
•
Utilizing personnel with specialized skill and knowledge in actuarial methods to assist in: (i) evaluating the appropriateness of the methodology and the assumptions used by management and management’s specialist, including assessment of the reasonableness of assumptions and inputs used in developing claim frequency and claim severity by evaluating industry data such as macroeconomic trends in delinquency rates, the Freddie Mac House Price Index data, historical pandemic data, and expected impact of natural disasters; (ii) developing an independent estimate of the reserve for insurance claims using Company and historical mortgage industry data and comparing this independent estimate to management’s and management’s specialist’s estimated reserve; and (iii) performing a retrospective review of the development of the prior year reserve estimate compared to current year actual results and continued estimated reserves.

NMI HOLDINGS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2024
1. 
Organization and Basis of Presentation
NMI Holdings, Inc. (NMIH) is a Delaware corporation, incorporated in May 2011 to provide private mortgage guaranty insurance (which we refer to as mortgage insurance or MI) through its wholly-owned insurance subsidiaries, National Mortgage Insurance Corporation (NMIC) and National Mortgage Reinsurance Inc. One (Re One). Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq exchange under the ticker symbol “NMIH.”
NMIC, our primary insurance subsidiary, issued its first mortgage insurance policy in April 2013. NMIC is licensed to write mortgage insurance in all 
50
 states and the District of Columbia (D.C.). Re One historically provided reinsurance coverage to NMIC in accordance with certain statutory risk retention requirements. Such requirements have been repealed and the reinsurance coverage provided by Re One to NMIC has been commuted. Re One remains a wholly-owned, licensed insurance subsidiary; however, it does not currently have active insurance exposures. In August 2015, NMIH capitalized a wholly-owned subsidiary, NMI Services, Inc. (NMIS), through which we offer outsourced loan review services to mortgage loan originators. We operate as a single segment for the purposes of assessing performance and making operating decisions.
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of NMIH and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All inter-company transactions have been eliminated. These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP) and our accounts are maintained in U.S. dollars. Certain prior year amounts on our consolidated balance sheet have been reclassified to conform with our current period presentation.
2. 
Summary of Accounting Principles
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the balance sheet date, as well as reported amounts of income and expenses for the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Insurance Premium Revenue Recognition
Premiums for primary mortgage insurance policies may be paid in a single payment at origination (single premium), on a monthly installment basis (monthly premium) or on an annual installment basis (annual premium), with such election and payment type fixed at policy inception. Premiums written at origination for single premium policies are initially deferred as unearned premiums and amortized into earnings over the estimated policy life, in accordance with the anticipated expiration of risk. Monthly premiums are recognized as revenue in the month billed and when the coverage is effective. Annual premiums are initially deferred and earned on a straight-line basis over the year of coverage. Upon cancellation of a policy, all remaining non-refundable deferred and unearned premium is immediately earned, and any refundable deferred and unearned premium is returned to the policyholder and recorded as a reduction to written premium and unearned premium reserve in the period paid.
Concentrations
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, no customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues. At December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 approximately 
10
%, 
10
% and 
11
%, respectively, of our total risk-in-force (RIF) was concentrated in California.
Reserves for Insurance Claims and Claim Expenses
We establish reserves for claims based on our best estimate of the ultimate claim costs for defaulted loans using the general principles contained in ASC 944, 
Financial Services 
-
 Insurance 
(ASC 944). A loan is considered to be in “default” as of the payment date at which a borrower has missed the preceding two or more consecutive monthly payments. We establish reserves for loans that have been reported to us in default by servicers, referred to as case reserves, and additional loans that we estimate (based on actuarial review and other factors) to be in default that have not yet been reported to us by servicers, referred to as incurred but not reported (IBNR) reserves. We also establish reserves for claim expenses, which represent the estimated cost of the claim administration process, including legal and other fees, as well as other general expenses of administering the claim settlement process. Claim expense reserves are either allocated (
i.e.
, associated with a specific claim) or unallocated (
i.e.
, not associated with a specific claim). 
90
NMI HOLDINGS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2024
The establishment of claims and claim expense reserves is subject to inherent uncertainty and requires significant judgment by management. Reserves are established by estimating the number of loans in default that will result in a claim payment, which is referred to as claim frequency, and the amount of claim payment expected to be paid on each such loan in default, which is referred to as claim severity. Claim frequency and severity estimates are established based on historical observed experience regarding certain loan factors, such as age of the default, size of the loan and loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, and are strongly influenced by assumptions about the path of certain economic factors, such as house price appreciation, trends in unemployment and mortgage rates. We consider the appropriateness of such inputs at each fiscal quarter and conduct an actuarial review annually to evaluate and, if necessary, update these assumptions.
Investments
We have designated our investment portfolio as available-for-sale and report our invested assets at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses in the portfolio, net of related tax expense or benefit, are recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive

income (AOCI) in shareholders' equity.
We measure fair value and classify invested assets in a hierarchy for disclosure purposes consisting of three “levels” based on the observability of inputs available in the marketplace used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). See Note 4, “
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
” for further discussion.
Purchases and sales of investments are recorded on a trade date basis. Net investment income is recognized when earned, and includes interest and dividend income together with amortization of market premiums and discounts using the effective yield method, and is net of investment management fees and other investment related expenses. For asset-backed securities and any other holdings for which there is a prepayment risk, prepayment assumptions are evaluated and revised as necessary. Any adjustments required due to changes in effective yields and prepayment assumptions are recognized on a prospective basis. Realized gains and losses are computed using the specific identification method.
We recognize an impairment on a security through the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income if (i) we intend to sell the impaired security; or (ii) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the impaired security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis. If a sale is intended or likely to be required, we write down the amortized cost basis of the security to fair value and recognize the full amount of the impairment through the statement of operations as a “
Realized Investment Loss
.”
For securities in an unrealized loss position where a sale is not intended or likely to be required, we further assess if the decline in fair value below amortized cost is driven by a credit related impairment, considering several items including, but not limited to:
•
the severity of the decline in fair value;
•
the financial condition of the issuer;
•
the failure of the issuer to make scheduled interest or principal payments;
•
recent rating downgrades of the applicable security or issuer by one or more nationally recognized statistical ratings organization; and
•
other adverse conditions related to or impacting the security or issuer.
To the extent we determine that a security impairment is credit-related, an impairment loss is recognized through the statement of operations as a provision for credit loss expense, and presented as a “
Realized Investment Loss.”
 We recognize an allowance for credit losses for the difference between the amortized cost and present value of future expected cash flows, limited by the amount the fair value of the security is below its amortized cost. Subsequent changes (favorable and unfavorable) in credit losses are recognized through the statement of operations as a provision for or a reversal of credit loss expense, and presented as a “
Realized Investment Gain or Loss.”
 The portion of a security impairment attributed to other non-credit related factors is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of taxes.
91
NMI HOLDINGS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2024
We have elected to present accrued interest receivable separately from available for sale securities on our consolidated balance sheets. Accrued interest receivable was $
22.4
 million and $
19.8
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and is included in “
Accrued Investment Income.”
 We have elected not to measure an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivable on available for sale securities. Accrued interest for available for sale securities is written off against interest income when the receivable has aged 90 days past due. We did not write off any accrued interest receivable during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022. 
We consider items such as U.S. Treasury Bills and commercial paper with original maturities of 12 months or less to be short-term investments.
Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs (DAC)
Costs directly associated with the successful acquisition of mortgage insurance policies, consisting of certain selling expenses and other policy issuance and underwriting expenses, are initially deferred and reported as DAC. DAC is reviewed periodically to determine that it does not exceed recoverable amounts. DAC is amortized to expense in proportion to estimated gross profits over the life of the associated policies. We revise the rate of amortization to reflect actual experience and any changes to persistency or loss development.
 Total amortization of DAC for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, net of a portion of the ceding commissions earned under our quota share reinsurance agreements (see “
Reinsurance”
, below
)
, was $
7.1
 million, $
3.6
 million and $
11.9
 million, respectively.
Premium Deficiency Reserves
We consider whether a premium deficiency exists and a premium deficiency reserve is required at each fiscal quarter using best estimate assumptions as of the testing date. A premium deficiency reserve is established if the net present value of expected future claim costs, claim adjustment expenses, policyholder dividends, unamortized acquisition costs and maintenance costs exceeds the net present value of expected future premiums, anticipated investment income and existing reserves for a specified group of policies.
 We have determined that 
no
 premium deficiency reserves were necessary for any of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024. 
Reinsurance
We cede insurance risk through the use of reinsurance contracts and follow reinsurance accounting for those transactions where significant risk is transferred. We account for premiums, claims and claim expenses that are ceded to reinsurers on a basis consistent with that which we use to account for the original policies we issue and pursuant to the terms of our reinsurance contracts. We account for premiums ceded or otherwise paid to reinsurers as a reduction to premium revenue.
NMIC entered into quota share reinsurance treaties effective September 1, 2016 and as modified April 1, 2019 (the 2016 QSR Transaction), January 1, 2018 (the 2018 QSR Transaction), April 1, 2020 and as amended January 1, 2024 (the 2020 QSR Transaction), January 1, 2021 (the 2021 QSR Transaction), October 1, 2021 (the 2022 QSR Transaction), July 1, 2022 (the 2022 Seasoned QSR Transaction), January 1, 2023 (the 2023 QSR Transaction), and January 1, 2024 (the 2024 QSR Transaction), which we refer to collectively as the QSR Transactions. We earn profit and ceding commissions in connection with the QSR Transactions (see Note 6, “
Reinsurance”
). Profit commissions represent a percentage of the profits recognized by reinsurers that are returned to us, based on the level of claims and claim expenses that we cede. We recognize any profit commissions we earn as a decrease to ceded earned premiums. Ceding commissions are calculated as a percentage of ceded written premiums under the 2016 QSR Transaction or as a percentage of ceded earned premiums under the 2018, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2022 Seasoned, 2023 and 2024 QSR Transactions, and are intended to cover our costs of acquiring and servicing direct policies. We recognize any ceding commissions generated under the QSR Transactions in a manner consistent with our recognition of earnings on the underlying reinsured policies. We account for ceding commissions earned as a reduction to underwriting and operating expenses.
Under the QSR Transactions, we cede a portion of claims and claim expenses and reserves to our reinsurers, and account for such ceded reserves as “
Reinsurance Recoverables”
 on the consolidated balance sheets and such ceded expenses as reductions to claims and claim expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had

$
32.3
 million and 
$
27.5
 million, respectively,
 of reinsurance recoverables under the QSR Transactions. We remain directly liable for all claim payments if we are unable to collect the recoverables due from our reinsurers and, as such, we actively monitor and manage our counterparty credit exposure to our reinsurance providers. We establish an allowance for expected credit loss against our reinsurance recoverables if we do not expect to recover amounts due from one or more of our reinsurance counterparties, and report our reinsurance recoverables net of such allowance, if any. We actively monitor the counterparty credit profiles of our reinsurers and each is required to partially collateralize its obligations under the terms of our QSR Transactions. The allowance for credit loss established with respect to our reinsurance recoverables was deemed immaterial as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
92
NMI HOLDINGS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2024
Variable Interest Entities
NMIC is a party to excess-of-loss reinsurance agreements with Oaktown Re VI Ltd., and Oaktown Re VII Ltd. (special purpose reinsurance entities collectively referred to as the Oaktown Re Vehicles) effective April 27, 2021 and October 26, 2021, respectively. At inception of the respective reinsurance agreements, we determined that each of the Oaktown Re Vehicles was a variable interest entity (VIE), as defined under GAAP Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 810, because they did not have sufficient equity at risk to finance their respective activities. We evaluated the VIEs at inception to determine whether NMIC was the primary beneficiary under each deal and, if so, whether we were required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of each VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is an enterprise that (1) has the power to direct the activities of the VIE, which most significantly impact its economic performance and (2) has significant economic exposure to the VIE, 
i.e.
, the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant. The determination of whether an entity is the primary beneficiary of a VIE is complex and requires management judgment regarding determinative factors, including the expected results of the VIE and how those results are absorbed by beneficial interest holders, as well as which party has the power to direct activities that most significantly impact the performance of the VIE. We concluded that we are not the primary beneficiary of each VIE and, as such, we do not consolidate them in our consolidated financial statements.
See Note 6, “
Reinsurance” 
for further discussion of the reinsurance arrangements.
Income Taxes
We account for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with ASC Topic 740, 
Income Taxes
. The liability method measures the expected future tax effects of temporary differences at the enacted tax rates applicable for the period in which the deferred asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled. Temporary differences are differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the consolidated financial statements that would result in future increases or decreases in taxes owed on a cash basis compared to amounts already recognized as tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
We purchase non-interest bearing U.S. Mortgage Guaranty Tax and Loss Bonds issued by the Treasury Department in order to claim a tax deduction for our contingency reserve balance. The tax and loss bonds are carried at cost and are reported as “
Prepaid Federal Income Taxes”
 on the consolidated balance sheets.
See Note 11, “
Income Taxes”
, for further discussion of the tax and loss bonds and other income tax matters.
Share-Based Compensation
We account for stock compensation in accordance with ASC 718, 
Compensation - Stock Compensation
, measuring awards using grant date fair value and recognizing the associated compensation expense over the requisite service or performance period of the award. Share-based compensation includes restricted stock units (RSUs) and stock option grants under our stock incentive plans. We calculate the fair value of stock option grants using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, which takes into account various subjective assumptions. Key assumptions used in the model include the expected volatility of our stock price, dividend yield and the risk-free interest rate, as well as the expected option term, giving consideration to the contractual terms of any award. We use the simplified method to estimate expected option term during the period as sufficient historical exercise data is not available. RSU grants may contain a service condition, or performance and service conditions. RSU grants are valued at our stock price on the date of grant less the present value of anticipated dividends, and we recognize their fair value as compensation expense over their requisite service or performance and service periods. We account for stock option and RSU forfeitures as they occur. Share-based compensation is recorded in 
“Underwriting and Operating Expenses”
 on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.
Earnings Per Share (EPS)
Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and common share equivalents that would be issuable upon the vesting of existing service-based and certain performance and service-based RSUs, and exercise of vested and unvested stock options and outstanding warrants. Common share equivalents are excluded from EPS computations in the periods in which they have an anti-dilutive effect.
93
NMI HOLDINGS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2024
Share Repurchases
Common stock repurchases are recorded at cost and presented as “
Treasury Stock
” on the consolidated balance sheets and statements of changes in shareholders’ equity. At the date of repurchase, shareholders’ equity is reduced by the aggregate repurchase price plus commissions, applicable taxes and other expenses that arise from the repurchase transaction
.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
We consider items such as U.S. Treasury Bills, certificates of deposit and money market funds with original maturities of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents.
Software and Equipment
We capitalize certain costs associated with the development of internal-use software and equipment. Software and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated amortization and depreciation. Amortization of software and depreciation of equipment commences at the beginning of the month following our placement of the assets into use. Amortization and depreciation are calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the respective assets, typically from 
three
 to 
five years
, unless factors indicate a shorter useful life. We amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the lives of the leases or estimated service lives of the leasehold improvements. Amortization and depreciation expense is recorded in “
Underwriting and Operating Expenses
” on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.
 For further detail, see Note 12, “
Software and Equipment.
”
Leases
We recognize right-of-use (ROU) assets and corresponding lease liabilities for our lease arrangements. Lease liabilities are established based on the estimated present value of lease payments over the relevant lease term. We estimate a discount rate for each lease based on our estimated incremental borrowing rate at the commencement date of the relevant lease, taking into consideration the cost of any outstanding collateralized borrowings we have at such time with adjustment for the terms of the lease agreement, and prevailing market conditions and macroeconomic factors at the time of its commencement. ROU assets are measured as the associated lease liability plus any direct costs incurred in connection with the initial establishment of the lease, less any lease incentives received.

Business Combinations, Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired from a business combination. In accordance with ASC 350, 
Intangibles – Goodwill and Other
, we test goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. We have 
no
t identified any impairments of goodwill through December 31, 2024.
Our intangible assets consist of state licenses and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (collectively, the GSEs) applications which have indefinite lives. We test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist.
 We have 
no
t identified any impairments of indefinite-lived intangible assets through December 31, 2024.
Premiums Receivable
Premiums receivable consists of premiums due on our mortgage insurance policies. If a mortgage insurance premium is unpaid for more than 120 days, the associated receivable is written off against earned premium and the related insurance policy is canceled. We recognize an allowance for credit losses for premiums receivable based on credit losses expected to arise over the life of the receivable. Due to the nature of our insurance policies (a necessary precondition for access to mortgage credit for covered borrowers) and the short duration of the related receivables, we do not typically experience credit losses against our premium receivables and the allowance for credit loss established on premium receivables was deemed immaterial at December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Premiums receivable may be written off prior to 
120
 days in the ordinary course of business for non-credit events including, but not limited to, the modification or refinancing of an underlying insured loan. We established a $
2.2
 million and $
2.7
 million reserve for premium write-offs at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Other Revenues
Other revenues represent underwriting fee revenue from our subsidiary, NMIS, which provides outsourced loan review

services to mortgage loan originators. NMIS fees are earned and recognized as services are provided, with cash payments typically received one month after billing.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements – Adopted
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280). The update expands annual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The standard took effect for all public business entities, including those that have only a single reportable segment for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. We adopted this ASU on December 31, 2024 and have included Note 9, “
Segment Reporting
” herein in accordance with the new requirements. 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements – Not Yet Adopted
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740). The update enhances the disclosure requirements related to tax rate reconciliations and income taxes paid. The standard will take effect for all public business entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024. We adopted this ASU on January 1, 2025 and will include enhanced disclosures in our fiscal year-end 2025 annual consolidated financial statements, as applicable. 
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Disaggregation of Income Statement Expense (Topic 220). The update expands disclosure requirements related to certain income statement expenses, including a requirement to provide a tabular disaggregation of certain operating expenses by category. The standard will take effect for all public business entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this ASU will have, if any, on our consolidated financial statements.
3. 
Investments
We hold all investments on an available-for-sale basis at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets and evaluate each position quarterly for impairment. We recognize an impairment on a security through the statement of operations if (i) we intend to sell the impaired security; or (ii) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the impaired security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis. If a sale is intended or likely to be required, we recognize an impairment loss equivalent to the difference of the amortized cost basis of the security and its fair value through the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income as a “Net Realized Investment Loss.” In the event of an impairment of a security that we intend to and have the ability to hold to maturity, we evaluate the drivers of the impairment to determine the portion that is credit related and the portion that is non-credit related. The portion of impairment loss that is attributed to credit related factors is recognized through the statement of operations as a provision for credit loss and the portion that is attributed to non-credit related factors is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of taxes.

Allowance for Credit Losses
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we did not recognize an allowance for credit loss for any security in the investment portfolio and we did not record any provision for credit loss for investment securities during the years ended December 31, 2024 or 2023. 
We evaluated the securities in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2024, assessing their credit ratings as well as any adverse conditions specifically related to the security. Based upon our assessment of the amount and timing of cash flows to be collected over the remaining life of each instrument, we believe the unrealized losses as of December 31, 2024 are not indicative of the ultimate collectability of the current amortized cost of the securities. Rather, the unrealized losses on securities held as of December 31, 2024 were primarily driven by fluctuations in interest rates, and to a lesser extent, movements in credit spreads following the purchase of those securities.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The following describes the valuation techniques used by us to determine the fair value of our financial instruments:
We established a fair value hierarchy by prioritizing the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under this standard are described below:
Level 1 – Fair value measurements based on quoted prices in active markets that we have the ability to access for identical assets or liabilities. Market price data generally is obtained from exchange or dealer markets. We do not adjust the quoted price for such instruments.
Level 2 – Fair value measurements based on inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals.
Level 3 – Fair value measurements based on valuation techniques that use significant inputs that are unobservable. Both observable and unobservable inputs may be used to determine the fair values of positions classified in Level 3. The circumstances for using these measurements include those in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. Therefore, we must make certain assumptions, which require significant management judgment or estimation about the inputs a hypothetical market participant would use to value that asset or liability.
In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
Assets Classified as Level 1 and Level 2
To determine the fair value of securities available-for-sale in Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, independent pricing sources have been utilized. One price is provided per security based on observable market data. To ensure securities are appropriately classified in the fair value hierarchy, we review the pricing techniques and methodologies of the independent pricing sources and believe that their policies adequately consider market activity, either based on specific transactions for the issue valued or based on modeling of securities with similar credit quality, duration, yield and structure that were recently traded. A variety of inputs are utilized by the independent pricing sources including benchmark yields, reported trades, non-binding broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data including data published in market research publications. Inputs may be weighted differently for any security, and not all inputs are used for each security evaluation. Market indicators, industry and economic events are also considered. This information is evaluated using a multidimensional pricing model. Quality controls are performed by the independent pricing sources throughout this process, which include reviewing tolerance reports, trading information and data changes, and directional moves compared to market moves. This model combines all inputs to arrive at a value assigned to each security. We have not made any adjustments to the prices obtained from the independent pricing sources

Financial Instruments Not Measured at Fair Value
On May 21, 2024, we issued $
425
 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes that mature on August 15, 2029 (the 2024 Notes). Proceeds from the 2024 Notes offering were primarily used to repay our then outstanding $
400
 million senior secured notes (the 2020 Notes). At December 31, 2024, the 2024 Notes were carried at a cost of $
415.1
 million, net of unamortized debt issuance costs and an original issue discount totaling $
9.9
 million, and had a fair value of $
429.6
 million as assessed under our Level 2 hierarchy. At December 31, 2023, the 2020 Notes were carried at a cost of $

 million, net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $
2.4

Debt 
Senior Unsecured Notes
At December 31, 2024, we had $
425
 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding. The 2024 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated May 21, 2024 and bear interest at a rate of 
6.00
%, payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15. Proceeds from the 2024 Notes offering were primarily used to repay the $
400
 million aggregate principal amount outstanding and associated amounts due on the redemption of the 2020 Notes. Remaining proceeds are available for general corporate purposes. 
The 2024 Notes mature on August 15, 2029. We may elect to redeem the 2024 Notes in whole or in part at any time prior to July 15, 2029 at a price equal to the greater of (1) the aggregate principal balance outstanding plus the present value of all future interest payments due through July 15, 2029, and (2) the aggregate principal balance due plus any accrued and unpaid

100
% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. 
In connection with the 2024 Notes offering, we recorded capitalized debt issuance costs and an original issue discount of $
10.9
 million. Such amounts will be amortized over the contractual life of the 2024 Notes using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate on the 2024 Notes is 
6.583
%. At December 31, 2024, $
9.9
 million of unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discounts remained. At December 31 2023, $
2.4
 million of unamortized debt issuance costs remained related to the 2020 Notes.
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, we recorded a $
6.8
 million loss related to the redemption of the 2020 Notes in “
Interest Expense” 
on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.
 At December 31, 2024 and 2023, $
15.6
 million and $
2.5
 million, respectively, of accrued and unpaid interest was included in “
Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses
” on our consolidated balance sheets.
Revolving Credit Facility
On April 29, 2024, we entered into a new $
250
 million five-year unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility) to replace our then outstanding $
250
 million four-year secured revolving credit facility (the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility). The 2024 Revolving Credit Facility matures on May 21, 2029. Borrowings under the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including to support growth, new business production and operations, and accrue interest at a variable rate equal to, at our discretion, (i) a Base Rate (as defined in the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility) subject to a floor of 
1.00
% per annum plus a margin of 
0.375
% to 
1.875
% per annum, or (ii) the Adjusted Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (as defined in the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility) plus a margin of 
1.375
% to 
2.875
% per annum, with the margin in each of (i) or (ii) based on our applicable corporate credit rating at the time. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
no
 amounts were drawn under the 2024 or 2021 Revolving Credit Facilities, respectively. 
Under the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility, we are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee on the average daily undrawn amount of 
0.175
% to 
0.525
%, based on the applicable corporate credit rating at the time. As of December 31, 2024, the applicable commitment fee was 
0.225
%. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recorded $
0.6
 million, $
0.8
 million and $
0.8
 million, respectively, of commitment fees in interest expense under the 2024 or 2021 Revolving Credit Facilities.
 We incurred debt issuance costs of $
2.1
 million in connection with the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility and had $
0.6
 million of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility remaining at the time of its replacement. Combined unamortized debt issuance costs are amortized through interest expense on a straight-line basis over the contractual life of the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, unamortized deferred debt issuance costs of $
2.3
 million and $
0.8
 million, respectively, were recorded in 
“Other Assets”
 on our consolidated balance sheets. 
Under the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility we are subject to certain covenants, including a maximum debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 
35
%, a minimum consolidated net worth requirement (as defined therein), and a requirement to maintain compliance with the financial standards prescribed by the private mortgage insurer eligibility requirements (PMIERs). We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2024.

6. 
Reinsurance
We enter into third-party reinsurance transactions to actively manage our risk, ensure compliance with PMIERs, state regulatory and other applicable capital requirements, (respectively, as defined therein), and support the growth of our business. The Wisconsin Office of the Commissioner of Insurance (Wisconsin OCI) has approved and the GSEs have indicated their non-objection to all such transactions (subject to certain conditions and ongoing review).

Excess-of-loss Reinsurance
Insurance-Linked Notes
NMIC is a party to reinsurance agreements with Oaktown Re VI Ltd. and Oaktown Re VII Ltd. (special purpose reinsurance entities collectively referred to as the Oaktown Re Vehicles) effective April 27, 2021 and October 26, 2021, respectively. Each agreement provides NMIC with aggregate excess-of-loss reinsurance coverage on a defined portfolio of mortgage insurance policies. Under each agreement, NMIC retains a first layer of aggregate loss exposure on covered policies and the respective Oaktown Re Vehicle then provides second layer loss protection up to a defined reinsurance coverage amount. NMIC then retains losses in excess of the respective reinsurance coverage amounts. 
NMIC makes risk premium payments to the Oaktown Re Vehicles for the applicable outstanding reinsurance coverage amount and pays an additional amount for anticipated operating expenses (capped at $
250
 thousand per year). NMIC ceded aggregate premiums to the Oaktown Re Vehicles of $
20.4
 million, $
31.1
 million and $
41.9
 million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
NMIC applies claims paid on covered policies against its first layer aggregate retained loss exposure under each excess-of-loss agreement. NMIC did not cede any incurred losses on covered policies to the Oaktown Re Vehicles during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, as the aggregate first layer risk retention for each applicable agreement was not exhausted during such periods.
Under the terms of each excess-of-loss reinsurance agreement, the Oaktown Re Vehicles are required to fully collateralize their outstanding reinsurance coverage amount to NMIC with funds deposited into segregated reinsurance trusts. Such trust funds are required to be invested in short-term U.S. Treasury money market funds at all times. Each Oaktown Re Vehicle financed its respective collateral requirement through the issuance of mortgage insurance-linked notes to unaffiliated investors. Such insurance-linked notes mature

 years from the inception date of their associated reinsurance agreement. We refer to NMIC’s reinsurance agreements with and the insurance-linked note issuances by Oaktown Re Vehicles individually as the 2021-1 ILN Transaction and 2021-2 ILN Transaction, and collectively as the ILN Transactions.
The respective reinsurance coverage amounts provided by the Oaktown Re Vehicles decrease over a 
12.5-year
 period as the underlying insured mortgages are amortized or repaid, and/or the mortgage insurance coverage is canceled. As the reinsurance coverage decreases, a prescribed amount of collateral held in trust by the Oaktown Re Vehicles is distributed to ILN Transaction noteholders as amortization of the outstanding insurance-linked note principal balances. The outstanding reinsurance coverage amounts stop amortizing, and the distribution of collateral assets to ILN Transaction noteholders and amortization of insurance-linked note principal is suspended if certain credit enhancement or delinquency thresholds, as defined in each agreement, are triggered (each, a Lock-Out Event).
NMIC holds optional termination rights under each ILN Transaction, including, among others, an optional call feature which provides NMIC the discretion to terminate the transaction on or after a prescribed date, and a clean-up call if the outstanding reinsurance coverage amount amortizes to 
10
% or less of the reinsurance coverage amount at inception or if NMIC reasonably determines that changes to GSE or rating agency asset requirements would cause a material and adverse effect on the

capital treatment afforded to NMIC under a given agreement. In addition, there are certain events that trigger mandatory termination of an agreement, including NMIC's failure to pay premiums or consent to reductions in a trust account to make principal payments to noteholders, among others.
Effective July 25, 2024 and December 27, 2024, NMIC exercised its optional termination rights to terminate its previously outstanding reinsurance agreements with and associated insurance-linked notes issued by Oaktown Re III Ltd. and by Oaktown Re V Ltd., respectively. In connection with the terminations, NMIC's excess of loss reinsurance agreements with Oaktown Re III Ltd. and Oaktown Re V Ltd. were commuted and the insurance-linked notes issued by Oaktown Re III Ltd. and Oaktown Re V Ltd. were redeemed in full with a distribution of remaining collateral assets.

Traditional Reinsurance 
NMIC is party to six excess-of-loss reinsurance agreements with broad panels of third-party reinsurers – the 2022-1 XOL Transaction, effective April 1, 2022, the 2022-2 XOL Transaction, effective July 1, 2022, the 2022-3 XOL Transaction, effective October 1, 2022, the 2023-1 XOL Transaction, effective January 1, 2023, the 2023-2 XOL Transaction, effective July 1, 2023, and the 2024 XOL Transaction, effective January 1, 2024 – which we refer to collectively as the XOL Transactions. Each XOL Transaction provides NMIC with aggregate excess-of-loss reinsurance coverage on a defined portfolio of mortgage insurance policies. Under each agreement, NMIC retains a first layer of aggregate loss exposure on covered policies and the reinsurers then provide second layer loss protection up to a defined reinsurance coverage amount. The reinsurance coverage amount of each XOL Transaction is set to approximate the PMIERs minimum required assets of its reference pool and decreases from its peak over a 
ten-year
 period in the event the PMIERs minimum required assets of the pool declines. NMIC retains losses in excess of the outstanding reinsurance coverage amount.
Under the terms of the XOL Transactions, NMIC makes risk premium payments to its third-party reinsurance providers for the outstanding reinsurance coverage amount and ceded aggregate premiums of $
38.4
 million, $
31.2
 million and $
13.9
 million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. NMIC applies claims paid on covered policies against its first layer aggregate retained loss exposure under each agreement. NMIC did not cede any incurred losses on covered policies under the XOL Transactions during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, as the aggregate first layer risk retention for each agreement was not exhausted during such periods.
NMIC holds optional termination rights which provide it the discretion to terminate each XOL Transaction on or after a specified date. NMIC may also elect to terminate the XOL Transactions at any point if the outstanding reinsurance coverage amount amortizes to 10% or less of the reinsurance coverage amount provided at inception, or if it determines that it will no longer be able to take full PMIERs asset credit for the coverage. Additionally, under the terms of the treaties, NMIC may selectively terminate its engagement with individual reinsurers under certain circumstances. Such selective termination rights arise when, among other reasons, a reinsurer experiences a deterioration in its capital position below a prescribed threshold, and/or a reinsurer breaches (and fails to cure) its collateral posting obligation.

The current reinsurance coverage and current first layer retained loss will decrease in future periods to the extent the PMIERs minimum required assets of the covered pool declines.
In October 2024, NMIC entered into two sequential excess-of-loss reinsurance treaties that will provide aggregate coverage for mortgage insurance policies to be written in 2025 and 2026 (the 2025 XOL Transaction and 2026 XOL Transaction, respectively). Under the terms of each agreement, NMIC will retain a first layer of aggregate loss exposure on covered policies and its reinsurance counterparties will then provide second layer loss protection up to a defined reinsurance coverage amount (of $
283.8
 million for the 2025 XOL Transaction and $
164.2
 million for the 2026 XOL Transaction). NMIC retains losses in excess of the respective reinsurance coverage amounts.
Quota Share Reinsurance
NMIC is party to 
eight
 quota share reinsurance treaties – the 2016 QSR Transaction, effective September 1, 2016 and as modified April 1, 2019, the 2018 QSR Transaction, effective January 1, 2018, the 2020 QSR Transaction, effective April 1, 2020 and as amended January 1, 2024, the 2021 QSR Transaction, effective January 1, 2021, the 2022 QSR Transaction, effective October 1, 2021, the 2022 Seasoned QSR Transaction, effective July 1, 2022, the 2023 QSR Transaction, effective January 1, 2023 and the 2024 QSR Transaction, effective January 1, 2024 – which we refer to collectively as the QSR Transactions. Under each of the QSR Transactions, NMIC cedes a proportional share of its risk on eligible policies to panels of third-party reinsurance providers. Each of the third-party reinsurance providers that is party to the QSR Transactions has an insurer financial strength rating of A- or better by S&P, A.M. Best or both.
Under the terms of the 2016 QSR Transaction, NMIC cedes premiums written related to 
20.5
% of the risk on eligible primary policies written for all periods through December 31, 2017. 
The 2016 QSR Transaction is scheduled to terminate on December 31, 2027. NMIC has the option, based on certain conditions and subject to a termination fee, to terminate the agreement as of December 31, 2020, or at the end of any calendar quarter thereafter, which could result in NMIC recapturing the related risk.
Under the terms of the 2018 QSR Transaction, NMIC cedes premiums earned related to 
25
% of the risk on eligible policies written in 2018 and 
20
% of the risk on eligible policies written in 2019. The 2018 QSR Transaction is scheduled to terminate on December 31, 2029. NMIC has the option, based on certain conditions and subject to a termination fee, to terminate the agreement as of December 31, 2022, or at the end of any calendar quarter thereafter, which could result in NMIC 
recapturing
 the related risk.
Under the terms of the 2020 QSR Transaction, NMIC cedes premiums earned related to 
21
% of the risk on eligible policies written between April 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020. The 2020 QSR Transaction is scheduled to terminate on December 31, 2030. NMIC has the option, based on certain conditions and subject to a termination fee, to terminate the

agreement as of December 31, 2025, or at the end of any calendar quarter thereafter, which could result in NMIC recapturing the related risk. 
Under the terms of the 2021 QSR Transaction, NMIC cedes premiums earned related to 
22.5
% of the risk on eligible policies written from January 1, 2021 to October 30, 2021. The 2021 QSR Transaction is scheduled to terminate on December 31, 2031. NMIC has the option, based on certain conditions and subject to a termination fee, to terminate the agreement as of December 31, 2024, or at the end of any calendar quarter thereafter, which could result in NMIC recapturing the related risk. 
Under the terms of the 2022 QSR Transaction, NMIC cedes premiums earned related to 
20
% of the risk on eligible policies written primarily between October 30, 2021 and December 31, 2022. The 2022 QSR Transaction is scheduled to terminate on December 31, 2032. NMIC has the option, based on certain conditions and subject to a termination fee, to terminate the agreement as of December 31, 2024 or semi-annually thereafter, which could result in NMIC recapturing the related risk.
Under the terms of the 2022 Seasoned QSR Transaction, NMIC cedes premiums earned related to 
95
% of the net risk on eligible policies primarily for a seasoned pool of mortgage insurance policies originated between January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2016 and July 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020, that had previously been covered under the retired Oaktown Re Ltd. and Oaktown Re IV Ltd. reinsurance transactions, after the consideration of coverage provided by other QSR Transactions. The 2022 Seasoned QSR Transaction is scheduled to terminate on June 30, 2032. NMIC has the option, based on certain conditions, to terminate the agreement as of June 30, 2025 or quarterly thereafter through December 31, 2027 with the payment of a termination fee, and as of March 31, 2028 or quarterly thereafter without the payment of a termination fee.

Such termination could result in NMIC recapturing the related risk.
Under the terms of the 2023 QSR Transaction, NMIC cedes premiums earned related to 
20
% of the risk on eligible policies written in 2023. The 2023 QSR Transaction is scheduled to terminate on December 31, 2033. NMIC has the option, based on certain conditions and subject to a termination fee, to terminate the agreement as of December 31, 2025 or semi-annually thereafter, which could result in NMIC recapturing the related risk.
Under the terms of the 2024 QSR Transaction, NMIC cedes premiums earned related to 
20
% of the risk on eligible policies written in 2024. The 2024 QSR Transaction is scheduled to terminate on December 31, 2034. NMIC has the option, based on certain conditions and subject to a termination fee, to terminate the agreement as of December 31, 2027, or at the end of any calendar quarter thereafter, which could result in NMIC recapturing the related risk.
NMIC may terminate any or all of the QSR Transactions without penalty if, due to a change in PMIERs requirements, it is no longer able to take full PMIERs asset credit for the RIF ceded under the respective agreements. Additionally, under the terms of the QSR Transactions, NMIC may elect to selectively terminate its engagement with individual reinsurers on a run-off basis (
i.e.
, reinsurers continue providing coverage on all risk ceded prior to the termination date, with no new cessions going forward) or cut-off basis (
i.e.
, the reinsurance arrangement is completely terminated with NMIC recapturing all previously ceded risk) under certain circumstances. Such selective termination rights arise when, among other reasons, a reinsurer experiences a deterioration in its capital position below a prescribed threshold and/or a reinsurer breaches (and fails to cure) its collateral posting obligations under the relevant agreement.
Effective January 1, 2025, NMIC terminated its engagement with 
one
 reinsurer under the 2016, 2018 and 2021 QSR Transactions by mutual agreement on a cut-off basis with no termination fees. Upon termination, NMIC recaptured approximately $
100
 million of previously ceded primary RIF. NMIC will stop ceding new premiums with respect to the recaptured risk and ceded premiums under each agreement will decrease by less than 
1
% in future periods.
In October 2024, NMIC entered into three sequential quota share reinsurance treaties that will provide coverage for mortgage insurance policies to be written in 2025, 2026 and 2027 (the 2025 QSR Transaction, 2026 QSR Transaction and 2027 QSR Transaction, respectively). Under the terms of the 2025 and 2026 QSR Transactions, NMIC will cede premiums earned related to 
20
% of the risk on eligible policies written between January 1, 2025 and December 31, 2026, in exchange for reimbursement of ceded claims and claims expenses on covered policies, a 
20
% ceding commission, and a profit commission of up to 
62
% that varies directly and inversely with ceded claims. Under the terms of the 2027 QSR Transaction, NMIC will cede premiums earned related to 
12
% of the risk on eligible policies written between January 1, 2027 and December 31, 2027, in exchange for reimbursement of ceded claims and claims expenses on covered policies, a 
20
% ceding commission, and a profit commission of up to 
61
% that varies directly and inversely with ceded claims.

Ceded premiums written under the 2016 QSR Transaction are recorded as prepaid reinsurance premiums in “
Other Assets”
 on our consolidated balance sheets and amortized to ceded premiums earned in a manner consistent with the recognition of revenue on direct premiums. Under all other QSR Transactions, premiums are ceded on an earned basis as defined in the agreement. NMIC receives a 
20
% ceding commission for premiums ceded under the QSR Transactions, except with respect to the 2022 Seasoned QSR Transaction under which it receives a 
35
% ceding commission and the 2020 QSR Transaction under which it receives a 
36
% ceding commission. NMIC also receives a profit commission under each of the QSR Transactions, provided that the loss ratios on loans covered under the 2016, 2018, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2022 Seasoned, 2023 and 2024 QSR Transactions, generally remain below

In accordance with the terms of the 2016 QSR Transaction, rather than making a cash payment or transferring investments for ceded premiums written, NMIC established a funds withheld liability, which also includes amounts due to NMIC for ceding and profit commissions. Any loss recoveries and any potential profit commission to NMIC are realized from this account until exhausted. NMIC’s reinsurance recoverable balance is further supported by trust accounts established and maintained by each reinsurer in accordance with the PMIERs funding requirements for risk ceded to non-affiliates. The reinsurance recoverable on loss reserves related to the 2016 QSR Transaction was $
1.1
 million and $
1.7
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
In accordance with the terms of the 2018, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2022 Seasoned, 2023 and 2024 QSR Transactions, cash payments for ceded premiums earned are settled on a quarterly basis, offset by amounts due to NMIC for ceding and profit commissions. Any loss recoveries and any potential profit commission to NMIC are also recognized quarterly. NMIC's reinsurance recoverable balance is supported by trust accounts established and maintained by each reinsurer in accordance with the PMIERs funding requirements for risk ceded to non-affiliates. The aggregate reinsurance recoverable on loss reserves related to the 2018, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2022 Seasoned, 2023, and 2024 QSR Transactions was $

7. 
Reserves for Insurance Claims and Claim Expenses
We hold gross reserves in an amount equal to the estimated liability for insurance claims and claim expenses related to defaults on insured mortgage loans. A loan is considered to be in “default” as of the payment date at which a borrower has missed the preceding two or more consecutive monthly payments. We establish reserves for loans that have been reported to us in default by servicers, referred to as case reserves, and additional loans that we estimate (based on actuarial review and other factors) to be in default that have not yet been reported to us by servicers, referred to as IBNR reserves.

We also establish reserves for claim expenses, which represent the estimated cost of the claim administration process, including legal and other fees, as well as other general expenses of administering the claim settlement process. As of December 31, 2024, we held gross reserves for insurance claims and claim expenses of $
152.1
 million. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we paid 
276
 claims totaling $
10.5
 million, including 
266
 claims covered under the QSR Transactions representing $
2.3
 million of ceded claims and claim expenses. 
We had 
6,642
 loans in default in our primary insured portfolio as of December 31, 2024, which represented a 
1.01
% default rate against 
659,567
 total policies in-force and 
5,099
 loans in default in our primary portfolio as of December 31, 2023, which represented a 
0.81
% default rate against 
629,690
 total policies in-force. The size of the reserve we establish for each defaulted loan (and by extension our aggregate reserve for claims and claim expenses) reflects our best estimate of the future claim payment to be made for each individual loan in default. Our future claims exposure is a function of the number of defaulted loans that progress to claim payment (which we refer to as frequency) and the amount to be paid to settle such claims (which we 
106

refer to as severity). Our estimates of claims frequency and severity are not formulaic, rather they are broadly synthesized based on historical observed experience for similarly situated loans and assumptions about future macroeconomic factors.

The “claims incurred” section of the table above shows claims and claim expenses incurred on defaults occurring in current and prior years, including IBNR reserves, and is presented net of reinsurance. The amount of claims incurred relating to current year defaults increased during the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, primarily due to an increase in the total number of new delinquencies emerging during the period tied to the growth and natural seasoning of our portfolio. Our provision for claims and claim expenses during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 benefited from favorable development on prior year defaults. We recognized $
61.7
 million, $
56.4
 million and $
48.8
 million of favorable prior year development during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, primarily due to cure activity and ongoing analysis of recent loss development trends. We may increase or decrease our claim estimates and reserves as we learn additional information about individual defaulted loans, and continue to observe and analyze loss development trends in our portfolio. Gross reserves of $
35.0
 million related to prior year defaults remained as of December 31, 2024.

Segment Reporting
We manage our business activities on a consolidated basis under a single reportable operating segment and our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) serves as the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).
Our Mortgage Insurance segment provides private mortgage insurance and ancillary loan review services and our CODM evaluates our performance and allocates resources based on our consolidated financial results, including consolidated revenue, expenses, net income, assets and shareholders' equity. Our CODM reviews these financial metrics to gauge our performance and make strategic decisions, such as whether to reinvest profits in our Mortgage Insurance segment or return capital to shareholders.
The significant revenue and expense categories that are regularly reviewed by our CODM align with those presented on our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (see “
Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income
”), and the accounting policies governing our Mortgage Insurance segment are the same as those described in Note 2, “
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
”
Included in our consolidated statement of operations, investment income, also referred to as interest revenue, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $
86.4
 million, $
68.2
 million and $

Share-Based Compensation
Share-based compensation includes stock options, service-based RSUs and performance and service-based RSUs granted under our 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (2012 Plan) and our Amended and Restated 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan (2014 Plan, and together with the 2012 Plan, the Stock Plans).
The 2012 Plan was approved by the Board on April 16, 2012 and authorized 
5.5
 million shares of common stock to be reserved for issuance, with limits of 
3.85
 million shares available for stock option issuance and 
1.65
 million shares available for RSU issuance. The 2012 Plan expired on April 24, 2022, with all unissued shares of common stock remaining under the 2012 Plan expiring thereafter. Share-based compensation previously issued under the 2012 Plan remains outstanding following the 2012 Plan expiry to the extent non-exercised or non-vested.
The 2014 Plan was originally approved by our stockholders at our annual meeting on May 8, 2014 and authorized 
4.0
 million shares of common stock to be reserved for issuance. On May 11, 2017, our stockholders approved amendments to the 2014 Plan at our annual stockholder meeting, authorizing an additional 
2.0
 million shares of common stock for issuance, increasing the total shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the plan to 
6.0
 million with the full amount available to be issued as either RSUs or options. On May 12, 2022, our stockholders approved further amendments to the 2014 Plan, authorizing an additional 
2.25
 million shares of common stock for issuance, increasing the total shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the plan to 
8.25
 million with the full amount available to be issued as either RSUs or options. These shares may be either authorized as unissued shares or treasury shares. Options granted under the 2014 Plan are non-qualified stock options and may be granted to employees, directors and other key persons. The exercise price per share for options covered by the 2014 Plan is determined by the Board at the time of grant, but shall not be less than the fair market value of our common stock, defined as the closing price of our common stock, on the date of the grant. The term of the stock option grants is established by the Board, but no stock option shall be exercisable more than 
ten years
 after the date the stock option was granted. The vesting period of the stock option grants is also established by the Board at the time of grant and is generally expected to be a 
three-year
 period.
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we incurred $
19.8
 million, $
16.9
 million and $
15.4

Represents amounts vested during the year, including the impact of performance adjustments for service and performance-based RSUs.
At December 31, 2024, we had 
1.3
 million granted and non-vested RSUs with a weighted average remaining contractual life of 
1.26
 years, consisting of 
0.8
 million RSUs that are subject to service-based vesting requirements and 
0.5
 million RSUs that are subject to performance and service-based vesting requirements. The total fair value of RSUs vested during the year ended December 31, 2024 was $
18.0
 million. As of December 31, 2024, $
13.9
 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to non-vested RSUs remained. Total remaining unrecognized compensation costs related to non-vested RSUs outstanding at December 31, 2024 will be recognized on a weighted average basis over 
1.29
 years.
Non-vested RSUs subject to service-based vesting requirements vest over a period ranging from 
one
 to 
three years
. Non-vested RSUs subject to performance and service-based vesting requirements vest after a 
three-year
 period, with the number of shares issued upon vesting based on the actual achievement of compound annual book value per share growth compared to a target established at the time of grant.

The grant date fair value of non-vested RSUs is measured as the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant less the present value of anticipated dividends to be paid during the vesting period.
401(k) Savings Plan

We offer our employees a 401(k) Savings Plan (401(k) Plan) that qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). Under the 401(k) Plan, we match up to 
100
% of eligible employees' pre-tax contributions up to 
5
% of eligible compensation. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we incurred approximately $

As a mortgage guaranty insurance company, we are eligible to claim a tax deduction for our statutory contingency reserve balance, subject to certain limitations outlined under IRC Section 832(e), to the extent we acquire tax and loss bonds in an amount equal to the tax benefit derived from the claimed deduction, which is our intent.

NMI HOLDINGS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2024
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we purchased $
86.9
 million, $
80.9
 million and $
65.2
 million, of tax and loss bonds, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we held $
322.2
 million and $
235.3
 million of tax and loss bonds, respectively, in “
Prepaid Federal Income Taxes”
 on our consolidated balance sheets.
At December 31, 2024, we had a federal net operating loss carryforward of $
1.0
 million which expires in varying amounts in 2030 and 2031, and state net operating loss carryforwards of $
135.2
 million, which begin to expire in varying amounts in 2032. Section 382 of the IRC imposes annual limitations on a corporation's ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforward if it experiences an “ownership change.
”
 As a result of the acquisition of our insurance subsidiaries in 2012, $
7.3
 million of federal net operating losses were subject to annual limitations of $
0.8
 million through 2016, $
0.5
 million in 2017 and $
0.3
 million, thereafter, through 2028. Our federal net operating loss carryforward arises from this limitation and the constraint on our ability to utilize the net operating loss carryforward in full during the current period.
We are required to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the asset will not be realized. We assess our need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. In the course of our review, we assess all available evidence, both positive and negative, including our expectations for future sources of income and contractual cash flows, the availability and application of tax planning strategies, and the potential reversal of temporary tax differences. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, we recorded valuation allowances of $
9.5
 million and $
9.2
 million, respectively, against state net deferred tax assets. The valuation allowances for both years primarily relate to state net operating losses generated by NMIH, as NMIH has historically operated at a loss and currently only generates revenue from its investment portfolio.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had 
zero
 reserves for unrecognized tax benefits as we have taken no material uncertain tax positions that would have required a reserve to be measured and recognized.
We file income tax returns with the U.S. federal government and various state jurisdictions that are subject to potential examination by tax authorities. We are not currently under examination by federal or state jurisdictions. Our U.S. federal income tax returns for 2021 and subsequent years, and state income tax returns for 2020 and subsequent years, remain open by statute.

In February 2024, we renewed the lease of our data center facility, extending its term through January 2026. Upon the extension, the ROU asset and liability associated with the lease was remeasured, using our current estimated incremental borrowing rate, resulting in an aggregate increase to ROU assets and lease liabilities of $
0.5

Commitments and Contingencies
PMIERs
As an 
approved insurer
, NMIC is subject to ongoing compliance with the PMIERs established by each of the GSEs (
italicized
 terms have the same meaning that such terms have in the PMIERs, as described below). The PMIERs establish operational, business, remedial and financial requirements applicable to 
approved insurers
. The PMIERs financial requirements prescribe a risk-based methodology whereby the amount of assets required to be held against each insured loan is determined based on certain loan-level risk characteristics, such as FICO, vintage (year of origination), performing vs. non-performing (
i.e.
, current vs. delinquent), LTV ratio and other risk features. In general, higher quality loans carry lower charges.
Under the PMIERs, 
approved insurers
 must maintain 
available assets
 that equal or exceed 
minimum required assets
, which is an amount equal to the greater of (i) $
400
 million or (ii) a total 
risk-based required asset 
amount. The 
risk-based required asset 
amount is a function of the risk profile of an 
approved insurer's
 RIF, assessed on a loan-by-loan basis against certain risk-based factors derived from tables set out in the PMIERs
, 
which is then adjusted on an aggregate basis for reinsurance transactions approved by the GSEs, such as with respect to our ILN Transactions, XOL Transactions and QSR Transactions. The 
aggregate gross risk-based required asset 
amount for performing, primary insurance is subject to a floor of 
5.6
% of
 performing primary adjusted RIF
.
By April 15th of each year, NMIC must certify it met all PMIERs requirements as of December 31st of the prior year. We certified to the GSEs by April 15, 2024 that NMIC was in full compliance with the PMIERs as of December 31, 2023. NMIC also has an ongoing obligation to immediately notify the GSEs in writing upon discovery of a failure to meet one or more of the PMIERs requirements. We continuously monitor NMIC's compliance with the PMIERs.
On August 21, 2024, the GSEs and FHFA updated PMIERs to revise the Available Asset credit mortgage insurers will receive for certain assets based on several factors, including asset class and credit rating. The updated PMIERs will take effect on a phased basis beginning March 31, 2025 and will be fully implemented on September 30, 2026. We do not expect the updated PMIERs to have a material impact on our 
available assets
 and 
risk-based required assets
, and we expect to remain in full compliance with the existing and updated PMIERs, as applicable, prior to, on and after March 31, 2025.
Litigation
We record a litigation liability when we determine that it is probable a litigation loss will be incurred and the amount of such anticipated loss can be reasonably estimated. In the event we determine that a litigation loss is reasonably possible (though not probable), we disclose an estimate of the possible loss if such estimate can be reasonably established or disclose the matter with no estimate if such estimate cannot be reasonably made. We evaluate litigation and other legal developments that could affect our accrual for probable losses or our estimated disclosure of possible losses and make ongoing adjustments to our accruals and disclosures as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood and the estimated amount of potential losses related to such matters.
We are currently named as a defendant in a litigation proceeding pertaining to the refund of certain mortgage insurance premiums under the Homeowners Protection Act. The case was dismissed in September 2023 and is currently pending appeal. We do not currently expect that we will incur a material loss in connection with the case and have not recorded a litigation liability for this matter.

Regulatory Information
Statutory Requirements
Our insurance subsidiaries, NMIC and Re One, file financial statements in conformity with statutory accounting principles (SAP) prescribed or permitted by the Wisconsin OCI, NMIC's principal regulator. Prescribed SAP includes state laws, regulations and general administrative rules, as well as a variety of publications of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). The Wisconsin OCI recognizes only statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the state of Wisconsin for determining and reporting the financial condition and results of operations of an insurance company and for determining its solvency under Wisconsin insurance laws.
The Wisconsin OCI has imposed a prescribed accounting practice for the treatment of statutory contingency reserves that differs from the treatment promulgated by the NAIC. Under Wisconsin OCI's prescribed practice mortgage guaranty insurers are required to reflect changes in their contingency reserves through statutory income. Such approach contrasts with the NAIC's treatment, which records changes to contingency reserves directly to unassigned funds. As a Wisconsin-domiciled insurer, NMIC's statutory net income reflects an expense associated with the change in its contingency reserve. While such treatment impacts NMIC's statutory net income, it does not have an effect on NMIC's statutory capital position.
The following table presents NMIC's statutory net income, statutory surplus, contingency reserve, statutory capital and risk-to-capital (RTC) ratio as of and for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:

Under applicable law in Wisconsin and

 other states, mortgage insurers must maintain minimum amounts of statutory capital relative to RIF to continue writing new business. While formulations of minimum statutory capital may vary in each state, the most common measure allows for a maximum permitted RTC ratio of 
25

Dividend Restrictions
NMIH is not subject to any limitations on its ability to pay dividends except those generally applicable to corporations that are incorporated in Delaware. Delaware law provides that dividends are only payable out of a corporation's capital surplus or, subject to certain limitations, recent net profits.
NMIC and Re One are subject to certain capital and dividend rules and regulations prescribed by jurisdictions in which they are authorized to operate and the GSEs that may restrict their ability to pay dividends to NMIH. Under Wisconsin law, NMIC and Re One may pay dividends up to specified levels (
i.e.
, “ordinary” dividends) with 30 days' prior notice to the Wisconsin OCI. Dividends in larger amounts (
i.e
., “extraordinary” dividends), are subject to the Wisconsin OCI's prior approval. Under Wisconsin law, an extraordinary dividend is defined as any payment or distribution that together with other dividends and distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the lesser of (i) 
10
% of the insurer's statutory policyholders' surplus as of the preceding December 31 or (ii) adjusted statutory net income for the twelve-month period ending the preceding December 31. During the year ended December 31, 2024, NMIC paid a $
96.3
 million ordinary course dividend to NMIH. NMIC has the capacity to pay aggregate ordinary dividends of $
98.4
 million to NMIH during the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2025.
As an 
approved insurer
 under PMIERs, NMIC would generally be subject to additional restrictions on its ability to pay dividends to NMIH if it failed to meet the financial requirements prescribed by PMIERs. Approved insurers that fail to meet the prescribed PMIERs financial requirements are not permitted to pay dividends without prior approval from the GSEs.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2023, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Management applied its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures, which by their nature, can provide only reasonable assurance regarding management's control objectives. Management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent or detect all errors and fraud. A control system, irrespective of how well it is designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance and cannot guarantee that it will succeed in its stated objectives.
Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms.
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Company's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, our management has concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by BDO USA, P.C., an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears below. 
There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
Shareholders and Board of Directors 
NMI Holdings, Inc. 
Emeryville, California    
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited NMI Holdings, Inc.’s (the “Company’s”) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the “COSO criteria”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria
.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedules listed in the accompanying index appearing under Part IV, Item 15 – Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules and our report dated February 14, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying “Item 9A, Controls and Procedures.” Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

SUPPLEMENTAL NOTES
PARENT COMPANY ONLY
Note A
The NMI Holdings, Inc. (Parent Company) financial statements represent the stand-alone financial statements of the Parent Company. These financial statements have been prepared on the same basis and using the same accounting policies as described in the consolidated financial statements included herein. Refer to the Parent Company's consolidated financial statements for additional information.
NMIH and its subsidiaries entered into a tax sharing agreement effective August 23, 2012, which was subsequently amended on September 1, 2016. Under original and amended agreements, each of the parties agreed to file consolidated federal income tax returns for all tax years beginning in and subsequent to 2012, with NMIH as the direct tax filer. The tax liability of each subsidiary that is party to the agreement is limited to the amount of the liability it would incur if it filed separate returns.
Note B

NMIC and Re One are subject to certain capital and dividend rules and regulations prescribed by jurisdictions in which they are authorized to operate and the GSEs that may restrict their ability to pay dividends to NMIH. Under Wisconsin law, NMIC and Re One may pay dividends up to specified levels (
i.e
., “ordinary” dividends) with 30 days' prior notice to the Wisconsin OCI. Dividends in larger amounts (
i.e.
,“extraordinary” dividends), are subject to the Wisconsin OCI's prior approval. Under Wisconsin law, an extraordinary dividend is defined as any payment or distribution that together with other dividends and distributions made within the preceding twelve months exceeds the lesser of (i) 10% of the insurer's statutory policyholders' surplus as of the preceding December 31 or (ii) adjusted statutory net income for the twelve-month period ending the preceding December 31. During the year ended December 31, 2024, NMIC paid a $
96.3
 million ordinary course dividend to NMIH, representing its full ordinary course dividend capacity payable under Wisconsin insurance laws for the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2024. NMIC has the capacity to pay aggregate ordinary dividends of $
98.4
 million to NMIH during the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2025.
The remaining net assets from dividend capacity are considered restricted. As of December 31, 2024, the amount of restricted net assets held by our consolidated insurance subsidiaries, which represents our equity investment in those insurance subsidiaries less their aggregate dividend capacity, totaled $
2.8
 billion, compared to $
2.5
 billion as of December 31, 2023.
Note C
The Parent Company provides certain services to its subsidiaries. The Parent Company allocates to its subsidiaries corporate expense it incurs in the capacity of supporting those subsidiaries, based on either an allocated percentage of time spent or internally allocated capital. Total operating expenses allocated to subsidiaries for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024 were $
177.2
 million, $
163.9
 million and $
148.4
 million, respectively. Amounts charged to the subsidiaries for operating expenses are based on actual cost, without any mark-up. The Parent Company considers these charges fair and reasonable. The subsidiaries reimburse the Parent Company for these costs in a timely manner, which has the impact of improving the cash flows of the Parent Company.
