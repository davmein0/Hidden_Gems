Shares of our Class A common stock trade on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “HLNE”. 
There is no established public trading market for our Class B common stock. Class B common stock may not be transferred independently of the corresponding Class B units, which are subject to significant restrictions on transfer as set forth in the HLA Operating Agreement. Holders of Class B common stock are entitled to receive only the par value ($0.001) of the Class B common stock upon exchange of the corresponding Class B unit pursuant to the exchange agreement.
Holders of Record
As of May 27, 2025, there were five stockholders of record of our Class A common stock. The number of record holders does not include persons who held shares of our Class A common stock in nominee or “street name” accounts through brokers. As of May 27, 2025, there were 25 stockholders of record of our Class B common stock.
Dividend Policy
We declared a quarterly dividend of $0.49 per share of Class A common stock to record holders in each quarter of fiscal 2025. On May 29, 2025, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.54 per share of Class A common stock to record holders at the close of business on June 20, 2025. The payment date will be July 7, 2025. We do not pay dividends on our Class B common stock.
The declaration and payment by us of any future dividends to holders of our Class A common stock is at the sole discretion of our board of directors. Our board intends to cause us to continue to pay a comparable cash dividend on a quarterly basis. Subject to funds being legally available, we intend to cause HLA to make pro rata distributions to its members, including us, in an amount at least sufficient to allow us to pay all applicable taxes, to make payments under the tax receivable agreement, and to pay our corporate and other overhead expenses, including dividend payments to our stockholders.

(2)  On November 6,  2018, we announced that our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase, in the aggregate, up to 6% of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock as of the date of the authorization, not to exceed $50 million (the “Stock Repurchase Program”). The authorization provides us the flexibility to repurchase shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time, based on market conditions and other factors. We have not repurchased any of our Class A common stock under the Stock Repurchase Program, so the full purchase authority remains available under this program, which expires 12 months after the date of the first acquisition under the authorization. Our board of directors most recently re-approved the Stock Repurchase Program in December 2024.

Business Overview
We are a global private markets investment solutions provider and operate our business in a single segment. We offer a variety of investment solutions to address our clients’ needs across a range of private markets, including private equity, private credit, real estate, infrastructure, real assets, growth equity, venture capital and impact. These solutions are constructed from a range of investment types, including primary investments in funds managed by third-party managers, direct investments alongside such funds and acquisitions of secondary stakes in such funds, with a number of our clients utilizing multiple investment types. These solutions are offered in a variety of formats covering some or all phases of private markets investment programs:
•
Customized Separate Accounts
: We design and build customized portfolios of private markets funds and direct investments to meet our clients’ specific portfolio objectives with regard to return, risk tolerance, diversification and liquidity. We generally have discretionary investment authority over our customized separate accounts, which comprised $98.8 billion of our AUM as of March 31, 2025. 
•
Specialized Funds
: We organize, invest and manage commingled specialized primary, secondary and direct investment funds. Our specialized funds invest across a variety of private markets and include equity, equity-linked and credit funds offered on standard terms, as well as shorter duration, opportunistically oriented funds. We launched our first specialized fund in 1997. Since then, our product offerings have grown steadily and now include evergreen offerings that primarily invest in secondaries and direct investments in equity and credit and are available to certain high-net-worth individuals. Specialized funds comprised $39.5 billion of our AUM as of March 31, 2025.
•
Advisory Services
: We offer non-discretionary investment advisory services to assist clients in developing and implementing their private markets investment programs. Our investment advisory services include asset allocation, strategic plan creation, development of investment policies and guidelines, the screening and recommending of investments, the monitoring of and reporting on investments and investment manager review and due diligence. Our advisory clients include some of 
72
the largest and most sophisticated private markets investors in the world. We had $819.5 billion of AUA as of March 31, 2025.
•
Distribution Management
: We offer distribution management services to our clients through active portfolio management to enhance the realized value of publicly traded stock they receive as distributions in-kind from private equity funds. 
•
Reporting, Monitoring, Data and Analytics:
 We provide our clients with comprehensive reporting and investment monitoring services, usually bundled into our broader investment solutions offerings, but also on a stand-alone, fee-for-service basis. We also provide comprehensive research and analytical services as part of our investment solutions, leveraging our large, global, proprietary and high-quality database for transparency and powerful analytics. Our data, as well as our benchmarking and forecasting models, are accessible through our proprietary technology solution, Cobalt LP, on a stand-alone, subscription basis. 
Our client and investor base is broadly diversified by type, size and geography. Our client base primarily comprises institutional investors that range from those seeking to make an initial investment in alternative assets to some of the world’s largest and most sophisticated private markets investors. As we offer a highly customized, flexible service, we are equipped to provide investment services to institutional clients of all sizes and with different needs, internal resources and investment objectives. Our clients include prominent institutional investors in the United States, Canada, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Australia and Latin America. We provide private markets solutions and services to some of the largest global pension, sovereign wealth and U.S. state pension funds. In addition, we believe we are a leading provider of private markets solutions for U.S. labor union pension plans, and we serve numerous smaller public and corporate pension plans, sovereign wealth funds, financial institutions and insurance companies, endowments and foundations, as well as family offices and high-net-worth individuals. 
Trends Affecting Our Business
Our results of operations are affected by a variety of factors, including conditions in the global financial markets and the economic and political environments, particularly in the United States, Western Europe and Asia. As interest rates remain elevated in response to continued inflationary pressures and public equity volatility continues, leading to a wider range of equity returns, we see increasing investor demand for alternative investments to achieve higher and less correlated relative yields and returns on invested capital. As a result, some investors have increased their allocation to private markets relative to other asset classes. In addition, the opportunities in private markets have expanded as firms have created new vehicles and products in which to access private markets across different geographies and opportunity sets. 
In addition to the aforementioned macroeconomic and sector-specific trends, we believe the following factors will influence our future performance:
•
The extent to which investors favor alternative investments. 
Our ability to attract new capital is partially dependent on investors’ views of alternative assets relative to traditional publicly listed equity and debt securities. We believe fundraising efforts will continue to be impacted by certain fundamental asset management trends that include: (1) the increasing importance and market share of alternative investment strategies to investors (including smaller institutions and high-net-worth individuals) in light of an increased focus on lower-correlated and absolute levels of return; (2) the increasing demands of the investing community, including the potential for fee compression and changes to other terms; (3) shifting asset allocation policies of institutional investors; and (4) increasing barriers to entry and growth. 
73
•
Our ability to generate strong returns. 
We must continue to generate strong returns for our investors through our disciplined investment diligence process in an increasingly competitive market. The ability to attract and retain clients is partially dependent on returns we are able to deliver versus our peers. The capital we are able to attract drives the growth of our AUM and AUA and the management and advisory fees we earn. 
•
Our ability to source investments with attractive risk-adjusted returns. 
An increasing part of our management fee and incentive fee revenue has been from our direct investment and secondary investment platforms. The continued growth of this revenue is dependent on our continued ability to source attractive investments and deploy the capital that we have raised or manage on behalf of our clients. Because we are selective in the opportunities in which we invest, the capital deployed can vary from year to year. Our ability to identify attractive investments and execute on those investments is dependent on a number of factors, including the general macroeconomic environment, valuation, transaction size, and expected duration of such investment opportunity. A significant decrease in the quality or quantity of potential opportunities could adversely affect our ability to source investments with attractive risk-adjusted returns. 
•
Our ability to maintain our data advantage relative to competitors. 
We believe that the general trend towards transparency and consistency in private markets reporting will create new opportunities for us to leverage our databases and analytical capabilities. We intend to use these advantages afforded to us by our proprietary databases, analytical tools and deep industry knowledge to drive our performance, provide our clients with customized solutions across private markets asset classes and continue to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors. Our ability to maintain our data advantage is dependent on a number of factors, including our continued access to a broad set of private market information on an ongoing basis, as well as our ability to maintain our investment scale, considering the evolving competitive landscape and potential industry consolidation. 
•
Our ability to continue to expand globally
. We believe that many institutional investors outside the United States are currently underinvested in private markets asset classes and that capturing capital inflows into private capital investing from non-U.S. global markets represents a significant growth opportunity for us. Our ability to continue to expand globally is dependent on our ability to continue building successful relationships with investors internationally and subject to the evolving macroeconomic and regulatory environment of the various countries where we operate or in which we invest. 
•
Increased competition to work with top private equity fund managers. 
There has been a trend among private markets investors to consolidate the number of general partners in which they invest. At the same time, an increasing flow of capital to the private markets has often times resulted in certain funds being oversubscribed. This has resulted in some investors, primarily smaller investors or less strategically important investors, not being able to gain access to certain funds. Our ability to invest and maintain our sphere of influence with these high-performing fund managers is critical to our investors’ success and our ability to maintain our competitive position and grow our revenue. 
74
•
Unpredictable, volatile and uncertain macroeconomic conditions
. Global economic conditions, including political environments, financial market performance, tariff policies, interest rates, credit spreads or other conditions beyond our control, all of which affect the performance of the assets underlying private market investments, are unpredictable and could negatively affect the performance of our clients’ portfolios or the ability to raise funds in the future. Since early 2025, the United States and countries around the world have experienced elevated levels of market volatility and uncertainty driven principally by geopolitical and global trade concerns, including, in particular, the announcements of the imposition of tariffs by the United States on certain of its trading partners in April 2025 and retaliation by certain such trade partners. This volatility and uncertainty adds to the risks and uncertainties in the business environment in which we operate and may have various negative impacts on our business and results of operations, including with respect to decreased valuations of investments by our specialized funds and customized separate accounts, deployments, realizations, and fundraising activities. 
•
Increasing regulatory requirements
. The complex regulatory and tax environment could restrict our operations and subject us to increased compliance costs and administrative burdens, as well as restrictions on our business activities.
Recent Transactions
February 2025 Offering
In February 2025, we and a selling stockholder completed a registered offering of an aggregate of 1,572,536 shares of Class A common stock at a price to the underwriter of $159.00 per share (the “February 2025 Offering”). The purpose of the February 2025 Offering was to provide liquidity to significant direct and indirect owners of HLA. The shares sold consisted of 10,255 shares held by the selling stockholder and  1,562,281 shares newly issued by us. We received $248.4 million in net proceeds from the sale of our shares and used all of the proceeds to settle exchanges by certain members of HLA of a total of 1,486,223 Class B units and 76,058 Class C units. In connection with the exchange of the Class B units, we also repurchased for par value and canceled a corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock. We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholder.
75
Key Financial and Operating Measures
Our key financial measures are discussed below. 
Revenues
We generate revenues primarily from management and advisory fees, and to a lesser extent, incentive fees. See “—Critical Accounting Estimates—Revenue Recognition of Incentive Fees” and Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the manner in which management and advisory fees and incentive fees are generated. 
Management and advisory fees
 comprise specialized fund and customized separate account management fees, advisory and reporting fees and distribution management fees. 
Revenues from customized separate accounts are generally based on a contractual rate applied to committed capital or net invested capital under management. These fees often decrease over the life of the contract due to built-in declines in contractual rates and/or as a result of lower net invested capital balances as capital is returned to clients. In certain cases, we also provide advisory and/or reporting services, and, therefore, we also receive fees for services such as monitoring and reporting on a client’s existing private markets investments. In addition, we may provide for investments in our specialized funds as part of our customized separate accounts. In these cases, we generally reduce the asset-based and/or incentive fees on customized separate accounts to the extent that assets in the accounts are invested in our specialized funds so that our clients do not pay duplicate fees.
Revenues from specialized funds are based on a percentage of limited partners’ capital commitments to, net invested capital or net asset value (“NAV”) in, our specialized funds. The management fee during the investment period is often charged on capital commitments and after the investment period (or a defined anniversary of the fund’s initial closing) is typically reduced by a percentage of the management fee for the preceding year or charged on net invested capital or NAV. In the case of certain funds, we charge management fees on capital commitments, with the management fee increasing during the early years of the fund’s term and declining in the later years. Management fees for certain funds are discounted based on the amount of the limited partners’ commitments, whether the limited partners commit early in the offering period or if the limited partners are investors in our other funds. 
Revenues from advisory and reporting, monitoring, data and analytics services are generally annual fixed fees, which vary depending on the services we provide, and are recognized over the service term. In limited cases, advisory service clients are charged basis point fees annually based on the amounts they have committed to invest pursuant to their agreements with us. In other cases where our services are limited to monitoring and reporting on investment portfolios, clients are charged a fee based on the number of investments in their portfolio. 
Distribution management fees are generally earned by applying a percentage to AUM or proceeds received. Certain active management clients may elect a fee structure under which they are charged an asset-based fee plus a fee based on net realized and unrealized gains and income net of realized and unrealized losses. 
Incentive fees
 comprise carried interest earned from our specialized funds and certain customized separate accounts structured as single-client funds in which we have a general partner commitment, and performance fees earned on certain other specialized funds and customized separate accounts.
For each of our secondary funds, direct investment funds, strategic opportunity funds and some of our evergreen funds, we generally earn carried interest equal to a fixed percentage of net profits, usually 10.0% to 
76
12.5%, subject to a compounded annual preferred return that is generally 6.0% to 8.0%. To the extent that our primary funds also directly make secondary investments and direct investments, they generally earn carried interest on a similar basis. Furthermore, certain of our primary funds earn carried interest on their investments in other private markets funds on a primary basis that is generally 5.0% of net profits, subject to the fund’s compounded annual preferred return. We recognize carried interest when it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur.
Performance fees are based on the aggregate amount of unrealized or realized gains earned by the applicable specialized fund or customized separate account, subject to the achievement of defined minimum returns to the clients or high-water marks. Performance fees range from 5.0% to 12.5% of net profits, with some subject to a compounded annual preferred return that varies by account but is generally 6.0% to 8.0%. Performance fees are recognized when it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur. 
The primary contingency regarding incentive fees is the “clawback,” or the obligation to return distributions in excess of the amount prescribed by the applicable fund or separate account documents. Incentive fees are typically only required to be returned on a net of tax basis due to a clawback. As such, the tax-related portion of incentive fees is typically not subject to clawback and is therefore recognized as revenue immediately upon receipt. In the event that a payment is made before it can be recognized as revenue, this amount would be included as deferred incentive fee revenue on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognized as income in accordance with our revenue recognition policy.
Expenses
Compensation and benefits 
is

our largest expense and consists of (a) base compensation comprising salary, bonuses and benefits paid and payable to employees, (b) equity-based compensation associated with the grants of restricted stock and performance awards and (c) incentive fee compensation, which consists of carried interest and performance fee allocations. We expect to continue to experience a general rise in compensation and benefits expense commensurate with expected growth in headcount and with the need to maintain competitive compensation levels as we expand geographically and create new products and services. 
Our compensation arrangements with our employees contain a significant bonus component driven by the results of our operations. Therefore, as our revenues, profitability and the amount of incentive fees earned by our customized separate accounts and specialized funds increase, our compensation costs rise. 
Certain current and former employees participate in a carried interest program whereby approximately 25% of incentive fees from certain of our specialized funds and customized separate accounts are awarded to plan participants. We record compensation expense payable to plan participants as the incentive fees become estimable and collection is probable. 
General, administrative and other 
includes travel, accounting, legal and other professional fees, commissions, placement fees, office expenses, depreciation and other costs associated with our operations. Our occupancy-related costs and professional services expenses, in particular, generally increase or decrease in relative proportion to the number of our employees and the overall size and scale of our business operations. 
77
Other Income (Expense)
Equity in income of investees 
primarily

represents our share of earnings from our investments in our specialized funds and certain customized separate accounts in which we have a commitment. Equity income primarily comprises our share of the net realized and unrealized gains (losses) and investment income partially offset by the expenses from these investments.
We have commitments in our specialized funds and certain customized separate accounts that invest solely in primary funds, secondary funds and direct investments, as well as those that invest across investment types. Equity in income (loss) of investees will increase or decrease as the change in underlying fund investment valuations increases or decreases. Since our direct investment funds invest in underlying portfolio companies, their quarterly and annual valuation changes are more affected by individual company movements than our primary and secondary funds that have exposures across multiple portfolio companies in underlying private markets funds.  Our specialized funds and customized separate accounts invest across industries, strategies and geographies, and therefore our investments do not include any significant concentrations in a specific sector or area outside the United States. 
Interest expense
 includes interest paid and accrued on our outstanding debt, along with the amortization of deferred financing costs, amortization of original issue discount and the write-off of deferred financing costs due to the repayment of previously outstanding debt. 
Interest income
 is income earned on cash and cash equivalents. 
Non-operating gain (loss) 
consists primarily of gains and losses on certain investments, changes in liability under the tax receivable agreement and other non-recurring or non-cash items.
Other income (expense) of consolidated variable interest entities (“VIEs”) 
consists of earnings from funds in which consolidated general partners entities, that are not wholly-owned by us, have commitments as well as interest income, unrealized gains on investments and interest expense on consolidated funds.
Income Tax Expense 
We are a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and therefore are subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes on our share of taxable income generated by HLA. HLA is treated as a pass-through entity for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. As such, income generated by HLA flows through to its limited partners, including us, and is generally not subject to U.S. federal or state income tax at the partnership level. Our non-U.S. subsidiaries generally operate as corporate entities in non-U.S. jurisdictions, with certain of these entities subject to non-U.S. income taxes. Additionally, certain of our subsidiaries are subject to local jurisdiction income taxes at the entity level. Accordingly, the tax liability with respect to income attributable to non-controlling interests (“NCI”) in HLA is borne by the holders of such NCI.
Non-controlling interests 
NCI reflect the portion of income or loss and the corresponding equity attributable to third-party equity holders and employees in certain consolidated subsidiaries that are not 100% owned by us. NCI are presented as separate components in our Consolidated Statements of Income to clearly distinguish between our interests and the economic interests of third parties and employees in those entities.
Fee-Earning AUM
Fee-earning AUM is a metric we use to measure the assets from which we earn management fees. Our fee-earning AUM comprise assets in our customized separate accounts and specialized funds from which we derive management fees that are generally derived from applying a certain percentage to the appropriate fee 
78
base. We classify customized separate account revenue as management fees if the client is charged an asset-based fee, which includes the majority of our discretionary AUM accounts but also includes certain non-discretionary AUA accounts. Our fee-earning AUM is equal to the amount of capital commitments, net invested capital and NAV of our customized separate accounts and specialized funds depending on the fee terms. The vast majority of our customized separate accounts and specialized funds earn fees based on commitments or net invested capital, which are not affected by market appreciation or depreciation. Therefore, revenues and fee-earning AUM are not significantly affected by changes in market value. 
Our calculations of fee-earning AUM may differ from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers. Our definition of fee-earning AUM is not based on any definition that is set forth in the agreements governing the customized separate accounts or specialized funds that we manage.

Year ended March 31, 2025 compared to year ended March 31, 2024 
Total revenues increased $158.3 million for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024, due to increases in management and advisory fees and incentive fees.
Management and advisory fees increased $61.9 million for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024. Specialized funds revenue increased by $54.2 million compared to the prior year, due primarily to increases of $52.1 million in revenue from our evergreen funds and $10.6 million in revenue from our latest secondary fund, which added  $4.1 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, in fee-earning AUM year-over-year. Revenue from our latest secondary fund included $20.7 million in retroactive fees during fiscal 2025 compared to $19.6 million during fiscal 2024. Retroactive fees are management fees earned from investors that commit to a specialized fund after the first closing of the fund and are required to pay a catch-up management fee as if they had committed to the fund at the first closing in a prior period. Revenue from our specialized funds was partially offset by a decrease of $10.3 million from contractual step downs and funds reaching the end of their term. Customized separate accounts revenue increased $5.6 million compared to the prior year due primarily to a $1.8 billion increase in fee-earning AUM from the addition of new accounts, additional allocations from existing accounts and continued investment activity during the fiscal year. Reporting, monitoring, data and analytics revenue increased $4.5 million compared to the prior year due primarily to increased Cobalt LP subscriptions during fiscal 2025. Fund reimbursement revenue increased

by $1.5 million compared to the prior year attributed primarily to the timing of newly created funds. Distribution management revenue decreased $2.4 million in fiscal 2025 compared to the prior year due to decreased stock distribution activity from investments held by clients that are managed by us. 
 Incentive fees increased $96.4 million for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024 due primarily to increases in the tax-related portion of carried interest distributions, proceeds realized on the sales of underlying investments in one of our specialized funds, and the recognition of $58.4 million in performance fees from one of our specialized funds moving from deal-by-deal incentive fees to a high-water mark performance fee. High-water mark performance fees are earned based on exceeding the highest period-end net asset value since inception, adjusted for subscriptions and redemptions.

Total expenses increased $88.0 million for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024, due to increases in both compensation and benefits expenses and general, administrative and other expenses.  
Compensation and benefits expenses increased $70.5 million for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024. Base compensation and benefits increased $41.8 million for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024, due primarily to an increase in salary expense from additional headcount and an increase in our bonus plan accrual. Equity-based compensation increased $19.3 million in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024, driven primarily by the performance awards granted during fiscal 2025. Incentive fee compensation increased $9.4 million for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024 due to an increase in incentive fee revenue in fiscal 2025.
General, administrative and other expenses increased $17.5 million for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024. This change consisted primarily of an increase of $4.2 million in fund reimbursement expense attributed to the timing of newly created funds, an increase of $4.1 million in consulting and professional fees, an increase of $2.7 million in third-party commissions primarily attributed to the increase in gross subscriptions to our evergreen funds, an increase
 of 
$1.9 million in conference and marketing expenses and an increase
 of

partially offset by a decrease in equity in income of investees.
Non-operating gain (loss) increased $10.9 million for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024, due primarily to the recognition of $10.8 million of gains on our technology investments compared to negative fair value adjustments in the prior year, partially offset by the recognition of $2.1 million in tax receivable agreement expense in fiscal 2025.
Equity in income of investees decreased $5.9 million for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024 due primarily to relatively smaller increases in investment valuations due to market conditions in fiscal 2025.

Total other income (expense) of consolidated VIEs increased $4.5 million for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024, due primarily to an increase of $8.9 million in unrealized gains related to assets held by consolidated funds during fiscal 2025, partially offset by a decrease in interest income of $4.4 million due primarily to interest income earned in fiscal 2024 by a previously consolidated credit fund prior to its deconsolidation.
Income Tax Expense
Our effective income tax rate in fiscal 2025 and 2024 was 13.4% and 19.3%, respectively. The fiscal 2025 effective income tax rate was different from the statutory tax rate due primarily to the portion of income allocated to NCI and a reduction in valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2025 was less than fiscal 2024 due primarily to less valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in fiscal 2025.

Net income attributable to NCI in Hamilton Lane Advisors, L.L.C. increased by $12.0 million due primarily to an overall increase in net income, partially offset by a decrease in NCI holders’ economic ownership percentage of Hamilton Lane Advisors, L.L.C. between periods. 
Net income attributable to NCI in consolidated funds decreased by $2.2 million due primarily to the deconsolidation of a fund for which NCI holders held a larger economic ownership during fiscal 2024, compared to the funds consolidated during fiscal 2025.

Year ended March 31, 2025 compared to year ended March 31, 2024 
Fee-earning AUM increased $6.3 billion for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024 due to contributions from customized separate accounts and specialized funds.
Customized separate accounts fee-earning AUM increased $1.8 billion for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024. Customized separate accounts contributions were $6.7 billion for fiscal 2025 due primarily to new allocations from existing clients and the addition of new clients. Distributions were $4.9 billion for fiscal 2025 due primarily to $1.9 billion from accounts moving from a committed to net invested capital fee base, $1.8 billion from returns of capital in accounts earning fees on a net invested capital or NAV fee base, and $1.2 billion from accounts reaching the end of their fund term.
Specialized funds fee-earning AUM increased $4.5 billion for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024. Specialized fund contributions were $7.1 billion for fiscal 2025, due primarily to $4.2 billion from our evergreen funds and $1.2 billion from our latest secondary fund.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
Below is a description of our unaudited non-GAAP financial measures. These are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measures, which are reconciled below. These measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing our operating performance, you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures. Other companies may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure.  
Fee Related Earnings
Fee Related Earnings (“FRE”) is used to highlight earnings from revenues that are measured and received on a recurring basis. FRE represents net income excluding (a) incentive fees, net of fee related performance revenues, and related compensation, (b) equity-based compensation, (c) interest income and expense, (d) income tax expense, (e) equity in income of investees, (f) non-operating gain (loss)

and (g) certain other significant items that we believe are not indicative of our core performance. We believe FRE is useful to investors because it provides additional insight into the operating profitability of our business. FRE is presented before income taxes. 
Fee related performance revenues (“FRPR”) are incentive fees expected to be measured and received from certain of our funds on a recurring basis and are not dependent on realization events of the fund’s underlying investments. We believe FRPR is useful to investors because it provides additional insight into our recurring revenues.
Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company modified its definition of FRE to exclude equity-based compensation and include FRPR. Equity-based compensation is non-cash compensation provided to retain employees and align employee and shareholder interest. It is not directly correlated with our operating results. Fee related performance revenues are expected to be received on a recurring basis depending upon performance of certain funds that pay incentive fees on a high-water mark basis. We believe that reporting non-GAAP results inclusive of these changes provides a supplemental view of our ongoing performance that is useful and relevant to our investors. As a result of the change, prior period amounts have been recast to reflect the updated presentation. 
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is an internal measure of profitability. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it enables them to better evaluate the performance of our core business across reporting periods. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income excluding (a) interest expense on our outstanding debt, (b) income tax expense, (c) depreciation and amortization expense, (d) equity-based compensation expense, (e ) non-operating (loss) gain and (f) certain other significant items that we believe are not indicative of our core performance.

Non-GAAP Earnings Per Share
Non-GAAP earnings per share (“EPS”) measures our per-share earnings excluding certain significant items that we believe are not indicative of our core performance and assuming all Class B and Class C units in HLA were exchanged for Class A common stock in HLI. Non-GAAP EPS is calculated as adjusted net income divided by adjusted shares outstanding. Adjusted net income is income before taxes fully taxed at our estimated statutory tax rate and excludes any impact of changes in carrying amount of our redeemable NCI. Adjusted shares outstanding for the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 are equal to weighted-average shares of Class A common stock outstanding - diluted. We believe adjusted net income and non-GAAP EPS are useful to investors because they enable them to better evaluate total and per-share operating performance across reporting periods. 
The following table shows a reconciliation of adjusted net income to net income attributable to Hamilton Lane Incorporated and adjusted shares outstanding to weighted-average shares of Class A common stock outstanding for fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023:

The year ended March 31, 2024  represents corporate income taxes at our estimated statutory tax rate of 23.4% applied to adjusted pre-tax net income. The 23.4% is based on a federal tax statutory rate of 21.0% and a combined state income tax rate net of federal benefits of 2.4%. The year ended March 31, 2023 represents corporate income taxes at our estimated statutory tax rate of 23.8% applied to adjusted pre-tax net income. The 23.8% is based on a federal tax statutory rate of 21.0% and a combined state income tax rate net of federal benefits of 2.8%.

Investment Performance
The following tables present information relating to the historical performance of our specialized funds with fund families having at least two distinct vintages and most recent fund sizes of greater than $500 million per fund. The data are presented from the date indicated through December 31, 2024 and have not been adjusted to reflect acquisitions or disposals of investments subsequent to that date.
When considering the data presented below, note that the historical results of our specialized funds are not indicative of the future results you should expect from such investments, from any future investment funds we may raise or from an investment in our Class A common stock, in part because:
•
market conditions and investment opportunities during previous periods may have been significantly more favorable for generating positive performance than those we may experience in the future;
•
the performance of our funds is generally calculated on the basis of the NAV of the funds’ investments, including unrealized gains, which may never be realized;
•
our historical returns derive largely from the performance of our earlier funds, whereas future fund returns will depend increasingly on the performance of our newer funds or funds not yet formed;
•
our newly-established funds may generate lower returns during the period that they initially deploy their capital;
•
in recent years, there has been increased competition for investment opportunities resulting from the increased amount of capital invested in private markets alternatives and high liquidity in debt markets, and the increased competition for investments may reduce our returns in the future; 
•
the performance of particular funds also will be affected by risks of the industries and businesses in which they invest; and
•
we may create new funds that reflect a different asset mix and new investment strategies, as well as a varied geographic and industry exposure, compared to our historical funds, and any such new funds could have different returns than our previous funds.
The historical and potential future returns of the investment funds we manage are not directly linked to returns on our Class A common stock. Therefore, you should not conclude that continued positive performance of the investment funds we manage will necessarily result in positive returns on an investment in our Class A common stock. As used in this discussion, internal rate of return (“IRR”) is calculated on a pooled basis using daily cash flows. See “—Performance Methodology” below for more information on how our returns are calculated.
Specialized Fund Performance
We organize, invest and manage specialized primary, secondary and direct investment funds. Our specialized funds invest across a variety of private markets and include equity, equity-linked and credit funds offered on standard terms, as well as shorter duration, opportunistically oriented funds. Below is performance information across our various specialized funds. Substantially all of these funds are globally focused, and they are grouped by the investment strategy utilized.

Performance Methodology
The indices presented for comparison are the S&P 500, MSCI World, Credit Suisse High Yield II (“CS HY II”) and Credit Suisse Leverage Loan (“CS LL”), calculated on a public market equivalent (“PME”) basis. We believe these indices are commonly used by private markets and credit investors to evaluate performance. The PME calculation methodology allows private markets investment performance to be evaluated against a public index and assumes that capital is being invested in, or withdrawn from, the index on the days the capital was called and distributed from the underlying fund managers. The S&P 500 Index is a total return capitalization-weighted index that measures the performance of 500 U.S. large cap stocks. The MSCI World Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization-weighted index of over 1,600 world stocks that is designed to measure the equity market performance of developed markets. The CS HY II Index, formerly known as the DLJ High Yield Index, is designed to mirror the investable universe of the U.S. dollar denominated high yield debt market. Prices for the CS HY II Index are available on a weekly basis. The CS LL Index is an index designed to mirror the investable universe of the U.S. dollar denominated leveraged loan market. Loans must be rated 5B or lower and the index frequency is monthly. 
Our IRR represents the pooled IRR for all discretionary investments for the period from inception to December 31, 2024. Gross IRR is presented net of management fees, carried interest and expenses charged by the general partners of the underlying investments, but does not include our management fees, carried interest or expenses. Our gross IRR would decrease with the inclusion of our management fees, carried interest and expenses. Net IRR is net of all management fees, carried interest and expenses charged by the general partners of the underlying investments, as well as by us. Net IRR figures for our funds do not include cash flows attributable to the general partner. Note that secondary portfolio IRRs can be initially impacted by purchase discounts (or premiums) paid at the closing of a transaction, the impact of which will diminish over time.
“Capital Invested” refers to the total amount of all investments made by a fund, including commitment-reducing and non-commitment-reducing capital calls. “Multiple” represents total distributions from underlying investments to the fund plus the fund’s market value divided by total contributed capital. “Gross Multiple” is presented net of management fees, carried interest and expenses charged by the fund managers of the underlying investments.
Specialized fund and pre-fund performance does not include ten funds-of-funds that have investor-specific investment guidelines. 
Many of our specialized funds utilize revolving credit facilities, which provide capital that is available to fund investments or pay partnership expenses and management fees. Borrowings may be paid down from time to time with investor capital contributions or distributions from investments. The use of a credit facility affects the fund’s return and magnifies the performance on the upside or on the downside.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Historical Liquidity and Capital Resources
We have managed our historical liquidity and capital requirements primarily through the receipt of management and advisory fee revenues. Our primary cash flow activities involve: (1) generating cash flow from operations, which largely includes management and advisory fees; (2) realizations generated from our investment activities; (3) funding capital commitments that we have made to certain of our specialized funds and customized separate accounts; (4) making dividend payments to our stockholders and distributions to holders of HLA units; and (5) borrowings, interest payments and repayments under our outstanding debt. As of March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents were $229.2 million and $114.6 million, respectively.
Our 
material
 sources of cash from our operations include: (1) management and advisory fees, which are collected monthly or quarterly; (2) incentive fees, which are volatile and largely unpredictable as to amount and timing; and (3) fund distributions related to investments in 
our specialized 
funds and certain customized separate accounts that we manage. We use cash flow from operations primarily to pay compensation and related expenses, general, administrative and other expenses, debt service, capital expenditures and distributions to our owners and to fund commitments to certain of our 
specialized 
funds and customized separate accounts. If cash flow from operations were insufficient to fund distributions to our owners, we expect that we would suspend paying such distributions. 
We have also accessed the capital markets and used proceeds from sales of our Class A common stock to settle in cash exchanges of HLA membership interests by direct and indirect owners of HLA pursuant to our exchange agreement.
Finally, we have used available cash and borrowings from our Loan Agreements to make strategic investments in companies that seek to offer technology-driven private markets data and wealth management solutions. We have used proceeds from the issuance of our Senior Notes to seed new 
specialized 
funds and for general corporate purposes. 
Senior Notes and Loan Agreements 
On October 8, 2024, HLA issued the Senior Notes pursuant to a note purchase agreement (the “Note Purchase Agreement”) among HLA and the institutional purchasers party thereto in a private placement transaction. Interest on the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears, commencing on April 15, 2025. Interest on the Senior Notes accrues from and including October 8, 2024. The Senior Notes will mature on October 15, 2029.
We maintain our Term Loan Agreement, Revolving Loan Agreement, 2020 Multi-Draw Term Loan Agreement, and 2022 Multi-Draw Term Loan Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“JPMorgan”). On October 7, 2024, HLA and JPMorgan amended each of the Loan Agreements in connection with HLA’s entry into the Note Purchase Agreement. The amendments included naming JPMorgan as the successor-in-interest to First Republic Bank, updating the maturity dates for the Loan Agreements and allowing for the incurrence of additional indebtedness. The Loan Agreements are cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted and the aggregate principal amount of loans that may be outstanding under all of the Loan Agreements is subject to an aggregate cap of $325 million (the “Cap”).
The Term Loan Agreement has a maturity date of July 1, 2029 and the interest rate is a floating per annum rate equal to the prime rate minus 1.25% subject to a floor of 3.00%. As of March 31, 2025, we had an outstanding balance of $93.1 million under the Term Loan Agreement. 
88
The Revolving Loan Agreement provides that the aggregate outstanding balance will not exceed $50 million, subject to the Cap, and has a maturity date of October 6, 2027. The interest rate is a floating per annum rate equal to the prime rate minus 1.50% subject to a floor of 2.25%. As of March 31, 2025, we did not have an outstanding balance under the Revolving Loan Agreement. 
The 2020 Multi-Draw Term Loan Agreement provides for a term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $100 million with a maturity date of April 1, 2030. The interest rate is a fixed per annum rate of 3.50%. As of March 31, 2025, we had an outstanding balance of $100 million under the 2020 Multi-Draw Term Loan Agreement.
The 2022 Multi-Draw Term Loan Agreement has a maturity date of October 1, 2029 and the interest rate is a floating per annum rate equal to the prime rate minus 1.50% subject to a floor of 3.00%. As of March 31, 2025, we did not have an outstanding balance under the 2022 Multi-Draw Term Loan Agreement. We are entitled to request term loans not to exceed $75 million in the aggregate, subject to the Cap, through September 30, 2025.
The Loan Agreements and the Note Purchase Agreement contain covenants that, among other things, limit HLA’s ability to incur indebtedness, transfer or dispose of assets, merge with other companies, create, incur or allow liens, make investments, pay dividends or make distributions, engage in transactions with affiliates and take certain actions with respect to management fees. The Loan Agreements also require HLA to maintain, among other requirements, (i) a specified amount of management fees, (ii) a specified amount of adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the Loan Agreements, and (iii) a specified minimum tangible net worth, during the term of each of the Loan Agreements. The Note Purchase Agreement requires HLA to maintain (i) a consolidated leverage ratio within a specified range and (ii) specified amounts of management fees, (as described in the Note Purchase Agreement). The obligations under the Loan Agreements are secured by substantially all the assets of HLA. As of March 31, 2025 and 2024, the principal amount of debt outstanding equaled $293.1 million and $196.9 million, respectively. We had $131.9 million in availability under the Loan Agreements as of March 31, 2025.

Operating Activities
Our operating activities generally reflect our earnings in the respective periods after adjusting for significant non-cash activity, including equity in income (loss) of investees, equity-based compensation, lease expense, fair value adjustments to investments and depreciation and amortization, all of which are included in earnings. For the years ended March 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023, our net cash provided by operating activities was driven primarily by receipts of management fees and incentive fees, partially offset by payment of operating expenses, which includes compensation and benefits and general, administrative and other expenses. Additionally, the years ended March 31, 2025  and 2024 were impacted by cash relinquished upon deconsolidation of a previously consolidated fund while the year ended March 31, 2023 was impacted by an impairment on one of our investments.
89
Investing Activities
Our investing activities generally reflect cash used for fixed asset purchases and contributions to and distributions from our investments. For the years ended March 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023, our net cash used in (provided by) investing activities was driven primarily by purchases of furniture, fixtures and equipment,  purchase of investments and convertible notes, and net contributions to our funds partially offset by the sale of investments.  
Financing Activities
Our financing activities generally reflect cash received from debt and equity financings, payments to owners in the form of dividends, distributions and repurchases of shares and scheduled drawdowns and repayments of our outstanding debt. For the years ended March 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023, our net cash used in (provided by) financing activities was driven primarily by dividends paid to stockholders, payments under the tax receivable agreement, distributions to HLA members, proceeds from and repayment of debt and contributions from NCI in consolidated funds. Additionally, the year ended March 31, 2023 included the redemption by our consolidated SPAC of its Class A common stock from its holders.
Future Sources and Uses of Liquidity
We generate significant cash flows from operating activities. We believe that we will be able to continue to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital requirements through our cash flows from operating activities, existing cash and cash equivalents and our ability to obtain future external financing. However, the availability of capital from the Loan Agreements and our cash balances are exposed to the credit risks of the financial institutions at which they are held. If events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions or the financial services industry generally, or concerns or rumors about any such events, occur, our ability to access existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, or to access existing or enter into new banking arrangements or facilities to pay operational and other costs, may be threatened or lost.
We will also continue to evaluate opportunities, based on market conditions, to access the capital markets for working capital or to use proceeds from sales of our Class A common stock to settle in cash exchanges of HLA membership interests by direct and indirect owners of HLA pursuant to our exchange agreement. The timing or size of any potential transactions will depend on a number of factors, including market opportunities and our views regarding our capital and liquidity positions and potential future needs. There can be no assurance that any such transactions will be completed on favorable terms, or at all.
We will also continue to evaluate opportunities to make strategic investments in companies that seek to offer technology-driven private markets data and wealth management solutions.
In November 2018, we authorized a program to repurchase up to 6% of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock, not to exceed $50 million (the “Stock Repurchase Program”). The Stock Repurchase Program does not include specific price targets or timetables and may be suspended or terminated by us at any time. We intend to finance the purchases using available working capital and/or external financing. The Stock Repurchase Program expires 12 months after the date of the first acquisition under the authorization. We have not repurchased any shares of our Class A common stock under the Stock Repurchase Program, and therefore the full purchase authority remains available. Our board of directors periodically reviews the Stock Repurchase Program and most recently re-approved it in December 2024.
We expect that our primary short-term and long-term liquidity needs will comprise cash to: (1) provide capital to facilitate the growth of our business; (2) fund commitments to our investments; (3) pay operating expenses, including cash compensation to our employees; (4) make payments and/or exercise early 
90
termination buyout rights under the tax receivable agreement; (5) fund capital expenditures,
 make strategic investments and warehouse investments for our funds
; (6) pay interest and principal due on our outstanding debt; (7) pay income taxes; (8) make dividend payments to our stockholders and distributions to holders of HLA units in accordance with our distribution policy; (9) settle exchanges of HLA membership interests by direct and indirect owners of HLA pursuant to our exchange agreement from time to time; and (10) fund purchases of our Class A common stock pursuant to the Stock Repurchase Program.
We are required to maintain minimum net capital balances for regulatory purposes for certain of our foreign subsidiaries and our broker-dealer subsidiary, and minimum cash balances related to our self-funded medical insurance plan put in place as of January 1, 2025. The net capital requirements are met by retaining cash. As a result, we may be restricted in our ability to transfer cash between different operating entities and jurisdictions. As of March 31, 2025, we were required to maintain approximately $6.3 million in liquid net assets to meet regulatory net capital and capital adequacy requirements. We are in compliance with these regulatory requirements. 
Dividend Policy 
The declaration and payment by us of any future dividends to holders of our Class A common stock is at the sole discretion of our board of directors. We intend to continue to pay a cash dividend on a quarterly basis. Subject to funds being legally available, we will cause HLA to make pro rata distributions to its members, including us, in an amount at least sufficient to allow us to pay all applicable taxes, to make payments under the tax receivable agreement, and to pay our corporate and other overhead expenses.  
Tax Receivable Agreement 
We expect that periodic exchanges of membership units of HLA by members of HLA will result in increases in the tax basis in our share of the assets of HLA that otherwise would not have been available. These increases in tax basis are expected to increase our depreciation and amortization deductions and create other tax benefits and therefore may reduce the amount of tax that we would otherwise be required to pay in the future. The tax receivable agreement will require us to pay 85% of the amount of these and certain other tax benefits, if any, that we realize (or are deemed to realize in the case of an early termination payment, a change in control or a material breach by us of our obligations under the tax receivable agreement) to the pre-IPO members of HLA.

(1)    
Represents scheduled debt obligation payments under our Loan Agreements and the Senior Notes.
(2)    
Represents interest to be paid over the maturity of the related debt obligations, which has been calculated assuming no pre-payments will be made and debt will be held until its final maturity date. The future interest payments are calculated using the variable interest rate of 6.25% on our Term Loan Agreement and the fixed interest rate of 3.50% on our 2020 Multi-Draw Term Loan Agreement.
(3)    
Represents commitments by us to fund a portion of each investment made by our specialized funds and certain customized separate account entities. These amounts are generally due on demand and are therefore presented in the less than one year category. 
(4)    
Represents uncalled commitments of our consolidated funds, excluding the Company's portion of uncalled commitments to the respective funds. Because capital contributions are due on demand, the above commitments have been presented as falling due within one year. 
We have entered into a tax receivable agreement with our pre-IPO owners pursuant to which we will pay them 85% of the amount of tax benefits, if any, that we realize (or are deemed to realize in the case of an early termination payment by us, a change in control or a material breach by us of our obligations under the tax receivable agreement) as a result of increases in tax basis (and certain other tax benefits) resulting from purchases or exchanges of membership units of HLA. Because the timing of amounts to be paid under the tax receivable agreement cannot be determined, this contractual commitment has not been presented in the table above. The tax savings achieved may be substantial and we may not have sufficient cash available to pay this liability, in which case, we might be required to incur additional debt to satisfy this liability.
We offer an Employee Investment Program (“EIP”) through which certain employees are able to invest directly into certain company managed funds as individual limited partners (“LPs”). The employees also have an option to enter into a loan agreement with the Company or a third-party lender to fund committed capital. The loan is collateralized by the underlying LP interest in the fund and return of capital distributions are utilized to pay the outstanding loan balance. We entered into a separate arrangement with the third-party lender to backstop the employee’s performance under the loan with a commitment to purchase the LP interest from the lender at the greater of fair value or the outstanding balance of the loan in the event of default by the employee. As of March 31, 2025, the total amount of outstanding loans under the EIP was $1.3 million and we believe the risk of default by an employee to be remote. 
92
Critical Accounting Estimates
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In applying many of these accounting principles, we need to make assumptions, estimates or judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in our combined and consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. These assumptions, estimates or judgments, however, are both subjective and subject to change, and actual results may differ from our assumptions and estimates. If actual amounts are ultimately different from our estimates, the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. We believe the following critical accounting estimates could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments. See Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a summary of our significant accounting policies. 
Consolidation
We consolidate all entities that we control either as the primary beneficiary of a VIE or through a majority voting interest. We perform a variable interest analysis for all entities in which we have a potential variable interest, which primarily consist of entities where we serve as the sponsor, general partner or managing member, and general partner entities not wholly owned by us.  If we have a variable interest in an entity that is determined to be a VIE, we will also analyze whether we are the primary beneficiary of this entity and whether consolidation is required. For entities determined not to be a VIE, we evaluate control via the voting interest model.
In evaluating whether we have a variable interest in the entity, we review the equity ownership and whether we absorb risk created and distributed by the entity, as well as whether the fees charged to the entity are customary and commensurate with the level of effort required to provide services.  Fees we receive are not variable interests if (i) the fees are compensation for services provided and are commensurate with the level of effort required to provide those services, (ii) the service arrangement includes only terms, conditions, or amounts that are customarily present in arrangements for similar services negotiated at arm’s length and (iii) our other economic interests in the VIE held directly and indirectly through related parties, as well as economic interests held by related parties under common control, where applicable, would not absorb more than an insignificant amount of the entity’s losses or receive more than an insignificant amount of the entity’s benefits. Evaluation of these criteria requires judgment.
For entities determined to be VIEs in which we have a variable interest, an evaluation is required to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary.  We evaluate economic interests in the entity, specifically determining if we have both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance (“the power”) and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE (“the benefits”).  When making the determination on whether the benefits received from an entity are significant, we consider the total economics of the entity, and analyze whether our share of the economics is significant. We utilize qualitative factors, and, where applicable, quantitative factors, while performing the analysis. 
VIEs for which we are the primary beneficiary have been included in our consolidated financial statements. The portion of the consolidated VIEs owned by third parties and any related activity is eliminated through non-controlling interests in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
93
At each reporting date, we determine whether any reconsideration events have occurred that require us to revisit the variable interest analysis and will consolidate or deconsolidate accordingly.
Revenue Recognition of Incentive Fees 
Incentive fees include both carried interest and performance fees earned from certain specialized funds and customized separate accounts. We recognized $199.1 million of incentive fees in fiscal 2025 and have $1.3 billion of unrecognized carried interest as of March 31, 2025.
Contracts with specialized funds and certain customized separate accounts provide incentive fees, which generally range from 5.0% to 12.5% of profits, when investment returns exceed minimum return levels or other performance targets. Incentive fees are generally payable after the achievement of performance targets or after all contributed capital and the preferred return on that capital has been distributed to investors. 
 Some incentive fees are subject to a “clawback,” or the obligation to return distributions in excess of the amount prescribed by the applicable fund or separate account documents. Incentive fees are typically only required to be returned on a net of tax basis due to a clawback. As such, the tax-related portion of incentive fees is typically not subject to clawback and is therefore recognized as revenue immediately upon receipt. Investment returns are highly susceptible to market factors and judgments and actions of third parties that are outside of our control which could impact the probability of a significant reversal occurring. Accordingly, incentive fees are not recognized until it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur.
We estimate the amount and probability of additional future capital contributions to specialized funds and customized separate accounts, which could impact the probability of a significant reversal occurring. The additional future capital contributions relate to unfunded commitments or follow-on investment opportunities in underlying portfolio investments. Incentive fees received before the revenue recognition criteria have been met are deferred and recorded within deferred incentive fee revenue in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Income Taxes
We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the carrying amount of the existing tax assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis using enacted tax rates expected to be applied in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. As of March 31, 2025, we had deferred tax assets of $308.5 million due primarily to our acquisitions of HLA units. Realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent primarily upon (1) historic earnings, (2) forecasted taxable income, (3) future tax deductions of tax basis step-ups related to our IPO and subsequent unit exchanges, (4) future tax deductions related to payments under the tax receivable agreement, and (5) our share of HLA’s temporary differences that result in future tax deductions. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more likely than not to be realized. As of March 31, 2025, we had a valuation allowance of $79.4 million. Changes in judgment as it relates to the realizability of these assets, as well as potential changes in corporate tax rates, would have the effect of significantly reducing the value of the deferred tax assets.
We analyze our tax filing positions in all of the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions where we are required to file income tax returns, as well for all open tax years in these jurisdictions. We evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing an entity’s tax returns to determine whether it is “more-likely-than-not” that each tax position will be sustained by the applicable tax authority.
Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining tax expense and in evaluating tax positions, 
94
including evaluating uncertainties under GAAP. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust our tax balances as new legislation is passed or new information becomes available.
Tax Receivable Agreement
Our purchase of HLA Class A units concurrent with the IPO, and subsequent exchanges by holders of HLA units for shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to the exchange agreement, result in increases in our share of the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of HLA, which increases the tax depreciation and amortization deductions that otherwise would not have been available to us. These increases in tax basis and tax depreciation and amortization deductions are expected to reduce the amount of cash taxes that we would otherwise be required to pay in the future. We entered into the tax receivable agreement with the other members of HLA, which requires us to pay exchanging HLA unitholders (the “TRA Recipients”) 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state, and local income tax that we actually realize (or, under certain circumstances, are deemed to realize) as a result of the increases in tax basis in connection with exchanges by the TRA Recipients described above and certain other tax benefits attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement. Generally, if we do not generate sufficient cumulative taxable income in the future to utilize the tax benefits, then we will not be required to make the related tax receivable agreement payments—the exception being that our obligation to make such payments may be accelerated if we elect to terminate the tax receivable agreement, in whole or in part, or if a change in control of us, or a breach of the tax receivable agreement by us, occurs. Therefore, we will generally only recognize a liability for payments under the tax receivable agreement for financial reporting purposes to the extent we determine it is probable that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize the related tax benefits. Estimating and projecting future taxable income is inherently uncertain and requires judgment. Actual taxable income may differ from estimates, which could significantly affect the liability under the tax benefit arrangements and our consolidated results of operations.
Based on current projections, we anticipate having sufficient taxable income to utilize these tax attributes and receive corresponding tax deductions in future periods. As of March 31, 2025, the tax receivable agreement resulted in a liability of $240.6 million. Significant changes in the projected liability resulting from the tax receivable agreement may occur based on changes in anticipated future taxable income, changes in applicable tax rates or other changes in tax attributes that may occur and could affect the expected future tax benefits to be received by us. 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Information regarding recent accounting developments and their impact on our results can be found in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
In the normal course of business, we are exposed to a broad range of risks inherent in the financial markets in which we participate, including price risk, interest-rate risk, access to and cost of financing risk, liquidity risk, counterparty risk and foreign exchange-rate risk. Potentially negative effects of these risks may be mitigated to a certain extent by those aspects of our investment approach, investment strategies, fundraising practices or other business activities that are designed to benefit, either in relative or absolute terms, from periods of economic weakness, tighter credit or financial market dislocations. 
Our predominant exposure to market risk is related to our role as general partner or investment manager for our specialized funds and customized separate accounts and the sensitivities to movements in the fair value of their investments, which may adversely affect our equity in income of investees. Since our 
95
management fees are generally based on commitments or net invested capital, our management fee and advisory fee revenue is not significantly impacted by changes in investment values. 
Fair value of the financial assets and liabilities of our specialized funds and customized separate accounts may fluctuate in response to changes in the value of securities, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. The impact of investment risk is as follows:
•
Equity in income of investees changes along with the realized and unrealized gains of the underlying investments in our specialized funds and certain customized separate accounts in which we have a general partner commitment. Our general partner investments include thousands of unique underlying portfolio investments with no significant concentration in any industry or country outside of the United States.
•
Management fees from our specialized funds and customized separate accounts are not significantly affected by changes in fair value as the management fees are not generally based on the value of the specialized funds or customized separate accounts, but rather on the amount of capital committed or invested in the specialized funds or customized separate accounts, as applicable. 
•
Incentive fees from our specialized funds with the exception of certain evergreen funds and customized separate accounts are not materially affected by changes in the fair value of unrealized investments because they are based on realized gains and subject to achievement of performance criteria rather than on the fair value of the specialized fund’s or customized separate account’s assets prior to realization. Minor decreases in underlying fair value would not affect the amount of deferred incentive fee revenue subject to clawback. 
Exchange Rate Risk
Several of our specialized funds and customized separate accounts hold investments denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies that may be affected by movements in the rate of exchange between the U.S. dollar and foreign currency, which could impact investment performance. The currency exposure related to investments in foreign currency assets is limited to our general partner interest, which is typically one percent of total capital commitments. We do not possess significant assets in foreign countries in which we operate or engage in material transactions in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Therefore, changes in exchange rates are not expected to materially impact our financial statements. 
Interest Rate Risk
 As of March 31, 2025, we had $193.1 million in borrowings outstanding under our Loan Agreements. The annual interest rate on the Term Loan Agreement, which is at the prime rate minus 1.25%, subject to a floor of 3.00%, was 6.25% as of March 31, 2025. The annual interest rate on the Revolving Loan Agreement, which is at the prime rate minus 1.50%, subject to a floor of 2.25%, was 6.00% as of March 31, 2025. 
Based on the floating rate component of our Loan Agreements payable as of March 31, 2025, we estimate that a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in increased interest expense of approximately

$0.9 million over the next 12 months. 
96
Credit Risk
We are party to agreements providing for various financial services and transactions that contain an element of risk in the event that the counterparties are unable to meet the terms of such agreements. In such agreements, we depend on the respective counterparty to make payment or otherwise perform. We generally endeavor to minimize our risk of exposure by limiting the counterparties with which we enter into financial transactions to reputable financial institutions. In other circumstances, availability of financing from financial institutions may be uncertain due to market events, and we may not be able to access these financing markets. 
There have been no material changes in our market risk exposures since March 31, 2024.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Hamilton Lane Incorporated 
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hamilton Lane Incorporated (the Company) as of March 31, 2025 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2025, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at March 31, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2025, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated May 30, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter 
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Recognition of Net Deferred Tax Asset from Equity Offering and Unit Exchange
Description of the Matter
As further discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, in connection with the Company’s equity offering and unit exchanges during the current year (the “Transactions”), the Company recorded a net deferred tax asset of $58.7 million. As further discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the resulting basis differences arising from the Transactions represent a temporary difference for which the Company records a deferred tax asset if it is more likely than not the deferred tax asset will be realized. Realization of this deferred tax asset is dependent upon, among other things, the future tax deductions of tax basis step-ups related to the Transactions. 
Auditing the Company’s recognition of the net deferred tax asset related to the Transactions is especially challenging, as the Company’s determination of the tax basis step-ups and related future tax deductions requires the application of complex tax laws and regulations for partnerships and the identification of historical basis differences.
99
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s net deferred tax asset recognition process, including controls over management’s review of the determination of the tax basis step-ups and related future tax deductions and the identified historical basis differences described above.
To test the recognition of the net deferred tax asset resulting from the Transactions, we involved tax subject matter professionals and performed procedures that included, among others, evaluating the technical merit of the Company’s determination of the tax basis step-ups and the related future tax deductions based on relevant tax law and regulations. We also used available tax-related information to evaluate the historical basis differences the Company used in its determination.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Hamilton Lane Incorporated 
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Hamilton Lane Incorporated’s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Hamilton Lane Incorporated (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2025, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of March 31, 2025 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2025, and the related notes and our report dated May 30, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
(In thousands, except share and per share amounts)
1.  Organization
Hamilton Lane Incorporated (“HLI”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on December 31, 2007 and, following its 2017 initial public offering (“IPO”), is a holding company whose principal asset is a controlling equity interest in Hamilton Lane Advisors, L.L.C. (“HLA”). As the sole managing member of HLA, HLI operates and controls all of the business and affairs of HLA, and through HLA, conducts its business.  As a result, HLI consolidates HLA’s financial results and reports a non-controlling interest (“NCI”) related to the portion of HLA units not owned by HLI.  The assets and liabilities of HLA represent substantially all of HLI’s consolidated assets and liabilities with the exception of certain cash, certain deferred tax assets and liabilities, payables to related parties pursuant to a tax receivable agreement, and dividends payable. Unless otherwise specified, “the Company” refers to the consolidated entity of HLI, HLA and subsidiaries throughout the remainder of these notes. As of March 31, 2025 and 2024, HLI held approximately 
76.6
% and 
73.6
%, respectively, of the economic interest in HLA. As future exchanges of HLA units occur pursuant to the exchange agreement, the economic interest in HLA held by HLI will increase. 
HLA is a registered investment advisor with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), providing asset management and advisory services, primarily to institutional investors, to design, build and manage private markets portfolios. HLA generates revenues primarily from management and advisory fees, comprised of specialized fund and customized separate account management fees, advisory and reporting fees and distribution management fees and, to a lesser extent, incentive fees, comprised of carried interest earned from our specialized funds and certain customized separate accounts structured as single-client funds in which we have a general partner commitment, and performance fees earned on certain other specialized funds and customized separate accounts. HLA sponsors the formation, and serves as the general partner or managing member, of various limited liability partnerships consisting of specialized funds and certain single client separate account entities (“Partnerships”) that acquire interests in third-party managed investment funds that make private equity and equity-related investments. The Partnerships may also make direct investments, including investments in debt, equity, and other equity-based instruments. The Company, which includes certain subsidiaries that serve as the general partner or managing member of the Partnerships, may invest its own capital in the Partnerships and generally makes all investment and operating decisions for the Partnerships. HLA operates several wholly owned entities through which it conducts its foreign operations.
2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The accompanying financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly owned subsidiaries, and entities that the Company controls. Certain of the Company’s consolidated funds are investment companies that follow specialized accounting guidance and reflect their investments at estimated fair value. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
109
Hamilton Lane Incorporated
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
(In thousands, except share and per share amounts)
Use of Estimates 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Consolidation
The Company consolidates all entities that it controls either as the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (“VIE”) or through a majority voting interest. The Company performs a variable interest analysis primarily for entities where the Company serves as the sponsor, general partner or managing member, and general partner entities not wholly owned by the Company.  If the entity is determined to be a VIE and the Company has a variable interest in it, the Company will then determine if it is the primary beneficiary of this entity and whether consolidation is required. For entities determined not to be a VIE, the Company evaluates its control via the voting interest model.
In evaluating whether it has a variable interest in the entity, the Company reviews the equity ownership and whether the Company absorbs risk created and distributed by the entity, as well as whether the fees charged to the entity are customary and commensurate with the level of effort required to provide services.  Fees received by the Company are not variable interests if (i) the fees are compensation for services provided and are commensurate with the level of effort required to provide those services, (ii) the service arrangement includes only terms, conditions, or amounts that are customarily present in arrangements for similar services negotiated at arm’s length and (iii) the Company’s other economic interests in the VIE held directly and indirectly through its related parties, as well as economic interests held by related parties under common control, where applicable, would not absorb more than an insignificant amount of the entity’s losses or receive more than an insignificant amount of the entity’s benefits. Evaluation of these criteria requires judgment.
For entities determined to be a VIE in which the Company has a variable interest, an evaluation is required to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary.  The Company evaluates its economic interests in the entity specifically determining if the Company has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance (“the power”) and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE (“the benefits”).  When making the determination on whether the benefits received from an entity are significant, the Company considers the total economics of the entity, and analyzes whether the Company’s share of the economics is significant. The Company utilizes qualitative factors, and, where applicable, quantitative factors, while performing the analysis. 
VIEs which the Company controls as the primary beneficiary have been included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The portion of the consolidated subsidiaries owned by third parties and any related activity is eliminated through non-controlling interests in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
At each reporting date, the Company determines whether any reconsideration events have occurred that require it to revisit the VIE analysis and will consolidate or deconsolidate accordingly.
See Note 6 for additional disclosure on VIEs.

Hamilton Lane Incorporated
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
(In thousands, except share and per share amounts)
Accounting for Differing Fiscal Periods
The Partnerships primarily have a fiscal year end as of December 31, and the Company accounts for its investments in the Partnerships using a three-month lag due to the timing of financial information received from the investments held by the Partnerships. The Partnerships primarily invest in private equity funds, which generally require at least 90 days following the calendar year end to present audited financial statements. 
The results of the consolidated VIEs are reported on a three-month lag, due to the timing of the receipt of related financial statements. 
The Company records its share of capital contributions to and distributions from the Partnerships in investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets during the three month lag period. The Company’s management and advisory fee revenue and incentive fee revenue is not accounted for on a lag.
To the extent that management is aware of material events that affect the Partnerships or the consolidated VIEs during the intervening period, the impact of the events would be disclosed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Foreign Currency
The Company and substantially all of its foreign subsidiaries utilize the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. The assets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the end of each reporting period. The results of foreign operations are translated using the exchange rate on the respective transaction dates. Translation adjustments are included in other comprehensive income (loss) within the consolidated financial statements until realized. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in general, administrative and other expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income .
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash
Cash deposits in interest-bearing money market accounts and highly liquid investments, with an original maturity of three months or less, are classified as cash equivalents. Interest earned on cash and cash equivalents is recorded as interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Restricted cash at March 31, 2025 and 2024 was primarily cash held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries to meet applicable government regulatory capital requirements and cash related to self-funded medical insurance for U.S. employees.
Fees Receivable
Fees receivable are equal to contractual amounts reduced for allowances, if applicable. The Company considers fees receivable to be fully collectible; accordingly, no allowance for credit losses has been established as of March 31, 2025 or 2024.

111
Hamilton Lane Incorporated
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
(In thousands, except share and per share amounts)
Due from Related Parties
Due from related parties in the Consolidated Balance Sheets consists primarily of advances made on behalf of the Partnerships for the payment of certain operating costs, expenses for which the Company is subsequently reimbursed and amounts due from current employees.
Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment
Furniture, fixtures and equipment consist primarily of leasehold improvements, office equipment, furniture and fixtures, and computer hardware and software and are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation. 
Depreciation is recognized in accordance with the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives as follows:
Computer hardware and software
3
 -
7
 years
Furniture and fixtures
5
 years
Office equipment
3
 years
Leasehold improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the shorter of their useful life or the life of the lease. Expenditures for improvements that extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized. Expenditures for ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.
Leases
The Company determines whether an arrangement contains a lease at inception. A lease is a contract that provides the right to control an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. For identified leases, the Company determines whether it should be classified as an operating or finance lease.  The Company accounts for lease components and non-lease components as a single lease component.  Lease right of use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease and measured based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Lease ROU assets include initial direct costs incurred by the Company and are presented net of deferred rent and lease incentives. Generally, the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate and as a result, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Some leases have the option to extend for an additional term or terminate early. Where it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option, the option has been included in the lease term and reflected in the ROU asset and liability. The Company does not recognize a lease ROU asset or lease liability for short-term leases, which have lease terms of 12 months or less. Lease expense for lease payments on operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Other Assets
Intangible assets
The Company’s intangible assets consist of customer relationship assets identified as part of previous acquisitions and purchased software. Identifiable finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 
7
 to 
10
 years. The Company does not hold any indefinite-lived intangible assets. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment quarterly, or when events or changes in 
112
Hamilton Lane Incorporated
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
(In thousands, except share and per share amounts)
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Company has 
no
t recognized any impairment charges in any of the periods presented.
The carrying value of the intangible assets was $
2,884
 and $
4,584
, and is included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The accumulated amortization of intangibles was $
9,286
 and $
8,367
 as of March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Amortization of intangible assets was $
1,701
, $
1,701
, and $
2,277
 for each of the years in the three-year period ended March 31, 2025, respectively, and is included in general, administrative and other expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The estimated amortization expense for each of the next five fiscal years is $
1,465
, $
1,154
, $
264
, $
0
, and $
0
, respectively.
Goodwill
Goodwill of $
9,566
  is included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of  March 31, 2025 and 2024, and was recorded in conjunction with previous acquisitions. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually utilizing a qualitative or quantitative approach, and more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. The impairment testing for goodwill is based first on a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Company’s reporting unit is less than the respective carrying value. The reporting unit is the reporting level for testing the impairment of goodwill. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value or when the quantitative approach is used, a two-step quantitative assessment is performed to (a) calculate the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to its carrying value, and (b) if the carrying value exceeds its fair value, to measure an impairment loss. The Company performed the annual impairment assessment as of December 31, 2024 noting that 
no
 goodwill impairment existed.
Convertible notes receivable
Convertible notes receivable of $
9,657
 and $
10,215
 as of March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, are included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Each note is recognized at amortized cost with interest accrued quarterly. Principal and interest obligations may be satisfied by a cash payment or converted to equity of the note issuers at the end of term or upon triggering events as defined in the note agreements. The Company considers the notes receivable to be fully collectible; accordingly, 
no
 allowance for credit losses has been established as of March 31, 2025 or 2024.

Investments
Equity method investments
Investments over which the Company is deemed to exert significant influence but not control are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. For investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting, the Company’s share of income (losses) is included in equity in income of investees in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company’s equity in income of investees is generally comprised of realized and unrealized gains from the underlying funds, portfolio companies held by the Partnerships and a technology investment. The carrying amounts of equity method investments are reflected in investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Measurement alternative investments
The Company’s investments valued under the measurement alternative include investments for which the Company does not exert significant influence and fair value is not readily determinable. These investments 
113
Hamilton Lane Incorporated
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
(In thousands, except share and per share amounts)
are recorded at cost, less impairment, if any, and subsequently adjusted for observable price changes of identical or similar investments of the same issuer. The Company performs qualitative impairment assessments at each quarter end on its investments recorded under the measurement alternative.
Fair value investments
The Company’s fair value investments represent a publicly traded security previously held by the Company, investments held by the consolidated funds and investments in private equity funds and direct  credit and equity investments that are held as collateral on the Company’s secured financing. The private equity fund investments can only be redeemed through distributions received from the liquidation of underlying investments of the fund, and the timing of distributions is currently indeterminable. The direct credit investments were debt securities classified as trading securities. Unrealized gains and losses from  investments held by the consolidated funds are recorded in unrealized gains in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Unrealized gains and losses from the publicly traded security and the investments held as collateral are recorded in non-operating gain (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
The Company previously transferred investments to a Partnership of which the Company is the general partner. Due to continuing involvement with these assets at the Partnership, the Company accounted for this transfer as a secured financing as it has not met the criteria in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 860, “Transfers and Servicing”, to qualify as a sale and, therefore, has recorded a financial liability for the secured financing which is included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.   
The Company elected to account for this secured financing at fair value under the fair value option to mitigate volatility in earnings from using different measurement attributes. The significant input to the fair value of the secured financing is the fair value of the fair value investments delivered as collateral which are estimated using Level 3 inputs with the significant inputs as disclosed in Note 5.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company utilizes a hierarchy that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used for the various valuation techniques (market approach, income approach, and cost approach). The levels of the hierarchy are described below:
•
Level 1: Values are determined using quoted market prices for identical financial instruments in an active market. 
•
Level 2: Values are determined using quoted prices for similar financial instruments and valuation models whose inputs are observable. 
•
Level 3: Values are determined using pricing models that use significant inputs that are primarily unobservable, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. 
 The Company uses these levels of hierarchy to measure the fair value of certain financial instruments on a recurring basis, such as for investments; on a non-recurring basis, such as for acquisitions and impairment testing; for disclosure purposes, such as for long-term debt; and for other applications, as discussed in their respective notes.
Categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. For a portion of our investments, net asset value (“NAV”) per share  (or its equivalent) provides the lowest level of input. These investments are considered investment companies,

(In thousands, except share and per share amounts)
or are the equivalent of investment companies, as they carry all investments at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value reflected in earnings. Investments valued using NAV are excluded from the fair value hierarchy. See Note 5 for further information.
The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, fees receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In October 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-06 - Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative. The amendments in this ASU incorporate 14 of the 27 disclosure requirements published in SEC Release No. 33-10532 - Disclosure Update and Simplification into various topics within the ASC. The amendments represent clarifications to, or technical corrections of, current requirements. For SEC registrants, the effective date for each amendment will be the date on which the SEC removes that related disclosure from its rules. Early adoption is prohibited. The amendments will be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the new requirements.
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280) - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. This ASU enhances segment disclosures primarily around significant segment expenses for both interim and annual periods and expanded single segment disclosure requirements. The amendments in this ASU are to be applied retrospectively and are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 on April 1, 2024. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, to enhance transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, on a prospective basis, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the new requirements.
In March 2024, the SEC adopted final rules to require disclosures about certain climate-related information in registration statements and annual reports. In April 2024, the SEC issued an order to stay the rules pending the completion of judicial review of multiple petitions challenging the rules. In March 2025, the SEC announced that it had voted to end its defense of the final rules to require disclosures about certain climate related information. The rules, if implemented, would require information about a registrant’s climate-related risks that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on its business, results of operations, or financial condition. The required information about climate-related risks will also include disclosure of a registrant’s greenhouse gas emissions, if material. In addition, the rules will require registrants to present certain climate-related financial metrics in their audited financial statements.  The Company is currently assessing the impact of the new requirements should the rules be implemented.
In December 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) introduced a 15% global minimum tax under the Pillar Two Global Anti-Base Erosion model rules. Several OECD member countries have enacted tax legislation based on certain elements of these rules that became effective on January 1, 2024. Other jurisdictions have announced the intent to implement these rules, but the rules remain subject to significant negotiation, potential change, and phase-in periods. As of March 31, 2025, the 
115
Hamilton Lane Incorporated
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
(In thousands, except share and per share amounts)
Company is not subject to the Pillar Two model rules and will continue to monitor legislative developments and the potential impact on future periods.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, “Income Statement (Topic 220): Reporting Comprehensive Income - Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures,” which requires public companies to disclose, in interim and annual reporting periods, additional information about certain expenses in the financial statements. The amendments in this ASU will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted and is effective on either a prospective basis or retrospective basis. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the new requirements.
Revenues
Management and advisory fees
The Company earns management fees from services provided to its specialized funds, customized separate accounts, and distribution management clients, and advisory fees from services provided to advisory clients where the Company does not have discretion over investment decisions. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those services. Specialized funds are structured as partnerships having multiple investors with a subsidiary of the Company serving as general partner or managing member.  Customized separate accounts are generally contractual arrangements involving an investment management agreement between the Company and a single client.  In some cases, a customized separate account will be structured as a partnership with a subsidiary of the Company serving as general partner or managing member.  The Company determined that the partnership is generally considered to be the customer with respect to specialized funds, while the individual investor or single limited partner is the customer with respect to customized separate accounts and advisory clients.
Management fees generally exclude the reimbursement of any partnership expenses paid by the Company on behalf of its customers pursuant to its contracts, including amounts related to professional fees and other fund administrative expenses. For the professional and administrative services performed by third parties that the Company arranges for the partnerships, the Company concluded that the nature of its promise is to arrange for the services to be provided and it does not control the services provided by third parties before they are transferred to the customer. Therefore, the Company is acting as an agent. Accordingly, the reimbursement for these professional fees paid on behalf of the partnerships is generally presented on a net basis.    
The Company also incurs certain costs, primarily employee travel, organization and syndication costs, for which it receives reimbursement from its customers in connection with satisfying these performance obligations. For reimbursable travel, organization and syndication costs, the Company concluded it controls the services provided by its employees and other parties and, therefore, is a principal. Accordingly, the Company records the reimbursement for these costs incurred on a gross basis as revenue in management and advisory fees and as expense in general, administrative and other expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
The Company considers its performance obligations in its customer contracts to be one of the following based upon the services promised: asset management services, arrangement of administrative services, distribution management services, or reporting services.
For asset management and arrangement of administrative services, the Company satisfies these performance obligations over time as the services are rendered and the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services as they are performed. The transaction price is the amount of 
116
Hamilton Lane Incorporated
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
(In thousands, except share and per share amounts)
consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised services to the customer.  Management fees from these performance obligations for contracts where the Company has discretion over investment decisions are generally calculated by applying a percentage to unaffiliated committed capital, net invested capital under management or NAV and are usually billed quarterly. For many partnerships, fees are based on committed capital during the investment period or net invested capital through the remainder of the partnership term.  The management fee base is subject to factors outside the Company’s control and, therefore, estimates of future period management fees are not included in the transaction price, as those estimates would be considered constrained. Advisory fees from these performance obligations for contracts where the Company does not have discretion over investment decisions are generally based upon fixed amounts and are usually billed quarterly.
For distribution management services, the Company satisfies these performance obligations at a point in time when shares are sold/liquidated and the proceeds are delivered and the customer receives and consumes the benefits of the services.  Distribution management fees are generally calculated by applying a percentage to the amounts sold/liquidated and are billed at the completion of each transaction.  
For reporting, monitoring, data and analytics services, the Company satisfies these performance obligations over time as the services are rendered and the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services as they are performed. Reporting and monitoring fees are generally calculated by applying a fixed rate multiplied by the number of funds monitored and are billed quarterly. Data and analytics fees are generally received on an annual basis and recognized over the service term.
The Company incurs certain costs related to the organization and syndication of new Partnerships. These costs generally include professional fees, legal fees, and other related items. The Company expenses these costs as they are incurred. Once the Partnership is successfully formed and has held its first closing, the Company recognizes those costs as revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income as the Partnership is then able to reimburse the Company for these costs.
Incentive fees
Contracts with certain customized separate accounts and specialized funds provide incentive fees, which generally range from 
5
% to 
12.5
% of profits, when investment returns exceed minimum return levels or other performance targets.  Investment returns are highly susceptible to market factors and judgments and actions of third parties that are outside of the Company’s control. Accordingly, incentive fees are considered variable consideration in asset management services. Some incentive fees are constrained by a contingency relating to “clawback,” or the obligation to return distributions in excess of the amount prescribed by the applicable fund or separate account documents. Any incentive fees considered to be constrained are not recognized until it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur. Incentive fees are typically only required to be returned on a net of tax basis due to a clawback. As such, the tax-related portion of incentive fees is typically not subject to clawback and is, therefore, recognized as revenue immediately upon receipt. The Company estimates the amount and probability of additional future capital contributions to specialized funds and customized separate accounts, which could impact the probability of a significant reversal occurring, when applicable. The additional future capital contributions relate to unfunded commitments or follow-on investment opportunities 
117
Hamilton Lane Incorporated
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
(In thousands, except share and per share amounts)
in underlying portfolio investments. Incentive fees received before the revenue recognition criteria have been met are deferred and recorded within deferred incentive fee revenue in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Compensation and Benefits
Compensation and Benefits consists of (a) base compensation comprising salary, bonuses and benefits paid and payable to employees, (b) equity-based compensation associated with the grants of restricted stock and performance awards and (c) incentive fee compensation, which consists of carried interest and performance fee allocations as detailed below.
Equity-based awards issued are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value of the restricted stock grant is based on the closing stock price on the trading day before the date of grant less the present value of expected future dividends. The fair value of the performance awards are based on a Monte-Carlo simulation valuation model at the date of grant. Expense related to employee equity-based compensation is recorded using the straight-line method over the vesting period. See Note 10 for more information regarding accounting for equity-based awards.
Incentive fee compensation expense includes compensation directly related to incentive fees. Certain employees of the Company are granted allocations or profit-sharing interests and are thereby, as a group, entitled to a 
25
% portion of the incentive fees earned by the Company from certain Partnerships and certain managed accounts subject to vesting. Amounts payable pursuant to these arrangements are recorded as compensation expense when they have become probable and reasonably estimable. Incentive fee compensation may be expensed before the related incentive fee revenue is recognized.
Non-Operating Gain (Loss)
Non-operating gain (loss) consists primarily of gains or losses recorded on sales of other assets,  fair value adjustments on investments and adjustments to the payable to related parties pursuant to the tax receivable agreement.

Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the carrying amount of the existing tax assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The principal items giving rise to temporary differences are certain basis differences resulting from the acquisitions of HLA units. Realization of the deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon (1) historic earnings, (2) forecasted taxable income, (3) future tax deductions of tax basis step-ups related to the IPO and subsequent unit exchanges, (4) future tax deductions related to payments under the tax receivable agreement, and (5) the Company’s share of HLA’s temporary differences that result in future tax deductions. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more likely than not to be realized. 
HLA is organized as a limited liability company and treated as a “flow-through” entity for income tax purposes. As a “flow-through” entity, HLA is not subject to income taxes apart from certain U.S. state and local taxes and foreign taxes attributable to its operations in foreign jurisdictions. Any taxable income or loss generated by HLA is passed through to and included in the taxable income or loss of its members, including HLI. As a result, the Company does not record income taxes on pre-tax income or loss attributable to the NCI 
118
Hamilton Lane Incorporated
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
(In thousands, except share and per share amounts)
in the general partnerships and HLA, except for certain U.S. state and local taxes and foreign taxes discussed above. HLI is subject to U.S. federal and applicable state corporate income taxes with respect to its allocable share of any taxable income of HLA.
The Company analyzes its tax filing positions in all of the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns, as well as for all open tax years in these jurisdictions. The Company evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing an entity’s tax returns to determine whether it is “more-likely-than-not” that each tax position will be sustained by the applicable tax authority.
Tax Receivable Agreement
The Company’s purchase of HLA Class A units concurrent with its IPO and periodic exchanges by holders of HLA units for shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, or cash, pursuant to the exchange agreement, result in increases in its share of the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of HLA, which will increase the tax depreciation and amortization deductions that otherwise would not have been available to HLI. These increases in tax basis and tax depreciation and amortization deductions reduce the amount of cash taxes that HLI would otherwise be required to pay in the future. HLI has entered into a tax receivable agreement with the other members of HLA (the “TRA Recipients”) that requires it to pay them 
85
% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state, and local income tax that HLI actually realizes (or, under certain circumstances, is deemed to realize) as a result of the increases in tax basis in connection with exchanges by the TRA Recipients described above and certain other tax benefits attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement.
Segments
Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision makers (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company’s CODM are its co-chief executive officers. The Company is managed as 
one
 reportable segment that provides private market investment solutions. These solutions derive revenues from customers and are offered in formats covering some or all phases of private markets investment programs. 

Financial information, annual operational plans and forecasts are reviewed by the CODM at the consolidated entity level. Consolidated net income is the primary measure of performance used by the CODM to establish objectives and allocate resources, with compensation and benefits being reviewed in more detail as a significant expense. Segment profit and loss is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income, with additional detail provided in Note 11 Compensation and Benefits relating to the significant expenses reviewed by the CODM. The measure of segment assets is not regularly presented to the CODM.
Concentrations of Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and fees receivable. The majority of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash is held with one major financial institution and exposes the Company to a certain degree of credit risk. Substantially all cash amounts on deposit with major financial institutions exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured limits. The concentration of credit risk with respect to fees receivable is generally limited due to the short payment terms extended to clients by the Company.

 During the Company’s quarterly impairment assessments for the period ended December 31, 2022,  it was determined that a quantitative assessment was required to be performed for one of its investments given a significant decrease in earnings performance and overall economic and market conditions. The assessment indicated that the fair value was less than the carrying value at December 31, 2022. Prior to the impairment recorded, the carrying value of the investment was $
74,189
. The impairment amount was $
43,289
 and is included in non-operating (loss) gain in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended March 31, 2023. The fair value was estimated using Level 3 inputs under the market approach with the significant input being the revenue multiple.

6.  Variable Interest Entities
The Company holds variable interests in entities that are considered VIEs because limited partners lack the ability to remove the general partner or dissolve the entity without cause by simple majority vote (i.e., do not have substantive “kick out” or “liquidation” rights).  The Company’s variable interest in such entities is in the form of direct equity interests in, and/or fee arrangements with, the Partnerships in which it also serves as the general partner or managing member. In the Company’s role as general partner or managing member, it generally considers itself the sponsor of the applicable Partnership and makes all investment and operating decisions. The Company consolidates VIEs in which it is determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary. 
Consolidated Variable Interest Entities
 The Company consolidates general partner entities of certain Partnerships and funds in which it is currently the primary beneficiary, which are not wholly-owned by the Company. The assets of the consolidated general partner VIEs represent investments in funds and the assets of the consolidated funds represent cash and investments. The assets may only be used to settle obligations of the respective consolidated VIEs, if any. In addition, there is no recourse to the Company for the consolidated VIEs’ liabilities, except for certain entities in which there could be a clawback of previously distributed carried interest. Once the Company no longer qualifies as the primary beneficiary of a consolidated VIE, it deconsolidates all the assets and liabilities of the NCI in the respective Partnership from the Consolidated Balance Sheets and records any remaining interest in the Partnership using the equity method within investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The deconsolidations during the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 did not impact the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income.
Non-consolidated Variable Interest Entities
Certain Partnerships that are VIEs are not consolidated because the Company has determined it is not the primary beneficiary based upon the Company’s equity interest percentage in each of the applicable VIEs. As of March 31, 2025, the total remaining unfunded commitments from the Company’s general partner entities to the non-consolidated VIEs was $
185,680
. Investor commitments are the primary source of financing for the non-consolidated VIEs.
The maximum exposure to loss represents the potential loss of assets recognized by the Company relating to these non-consolidated VIEs. The Company believes that its maximum exposure to loss is limited because

it establishes separate limited liability or limited partnership entities to serve as the general partner or managing member of the Partnerships.

The amendments included naming JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. as the successor-in-interest to First Republic Bank, updating the maturity dates for the Loan Agreements and allowing for the incurrence of additional indebtedness. 
The Term Loan Agreement has a maturity date of July 1, 2029.  The Revolving Loan Agreement has a $
50,000
 borrowing capacity, a maturity date of October 6, 2027, and the interest rate is a floating per annum rate equal to the prime rate minus 
1.50
% subject to a floor of 
2.25
%. The 2020 Multi-Draw Term Loan Agreement provides for a term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $
100,000
 that the Company has fully drawn down. Borrowings accrue interest at a fixed per annum rate of 
3.50
% and mature on April 1, 2030. The 2022 Multi-Draw Term Loan Agreement provides for a term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $
75,000
. Borrowings accrue interest at a fixed per annum rate equal to the prime rate  minus

3.00
% and matures on October 1, 2029. As of March 31, 2025, the Company had 
no
 borrowings outstanding under the 2022 Multi-Draw Term Loan Agreement.
The Loan Agreements contain covenants that, among other things, limit HLA’s ability to incur indebtedness, transfer or dispose of assets, merge with other companies, create, incur or allow liens, make investments, pay dividends or make distributions, engage in transactions with affiliates and take certain actions with respect to management fees. They also require HLA to maintain, among other requirements, (i) a specified amount of management fees, (ii) a specified amount of adjusted EBITDA, as defined therein, and (iii) a specified minimum tangible net worth, during the term of each of the Loan Agreements. 
On October 8, 2024, HLA issued $
100,000
 aggregate principal amount of its 
5.28
% senior notes due October 15, 2029 (the “Senior Notes”), pursuant to a note purchase agreement (the “Note Purchase Agreement”), among HLA and the institutional purchasers party thereto in a private placement transaction. Interest on the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears, commencing on April 15, 2025. Interest on the Senior Notes accrues from and including October 8, 2024.

 classes of common stock outstanding, Class A common stock and Class B common stock.
Class A common stock

Holders of Class A common stock are entitled to 
one
 vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. Additionally, holders of shares of Class A common stock are entitled to receive dividends when and if declared by the Board of Directors, subject to any statutory or contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends and to any restrictions on the payment of dividends imposed by the terms of any outstanding preferred stock.

Class B common stock

Income and equity allocations to NCI interests are based upon the relative ownership percentage of the consolidated VIE held by non-controlling owners. The reallocation adjustment between HLI stockholders’ equity and NCI in HLA relates to the impact of changes in economic ownership percentages during the period and adjusting previously recorded equity transactions to the economic ownership percentage as of the end of each reporting period.  
HLA Operating Agreement
In accordance with the limited liability company agreement of HLA (the “HLA Operating Agreement”), profits and losses from HLA are allocated on a pro rata basis based upon each member’s economic interests.  The HLA Operating Agreement provides that distributions are made on a pro rata basis to pay income taxes owed by the members on their share of HLA’s taxable income. In addition to these tax distributions, HLA made distributions in excess of required tax distributions to members in an aggregate amount of $

10.  Equity Based Compensation
2017 Equity Incentive Plan
The Company has adopted its 2017 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the “Plan”), which permits the issuance of up to 
10,000,000
 shares of Class A common stock, which may be granted as incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance stock, restricted stock units or performance stock units. Awards under the Plan generally vest over 
four
 to 
five years
, with options expiring not more than 
ten years
 from the date of grant, 
three months
 after termination of employment or 
one year
 after the date of death or termination due to disability of the grantee. As of March 31, 2025, there were 
6,048,176
 shares of Class A common stock available to grant under the Plan. Pursuant to the terms of the Plan, awards may not be granted after September 5, 2034. 
Employee Share Purchase Plan
The Company has adopted its Employee Share Purchase Plan, as amended (“ESPP”), which permits eligible employees to elect to purchase the Company’s Class A common stock via paycheck deductions. The purchase price is 
85
% of the closing price of the Company’s Class A common stock on the last trading day of each offering period, which begins the first day of each fiscal quarter and ends on the last day of that fiscal quarter. The Company’s initial offering period started January 1, 2019. At inception, there were 
1,000,000
 shares available for purchase through the ESPP and 
834,695
 shares were available as of March 31, 2025.

Restricted Stock Awards
Holders of restricted stock have all of the rights of a stockholder with respect to such shares, including the right to vote the shares but not the right to receive dividends or other distributions. Substantially all of the awards vest over 
four years
 in equal annual installments. On each vesting date, the related employee tax liabilities are either paid in cash by the employee or stock is sold back to the Company at the then-current fair value to offset the required minimum tax withholding obligations. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur. Compensation expense related to the awards is recognized ratably each month over the vesting period.

), respectively. 
Performance Awards
The Company has granted performance stock awards to certain employees that are subject to both a market-based vesting and a service-based vesting condition (“Performance Awards”). The Performance Awards will vest based upon (i) the market price of HLI Class A common stock achieving certain price thresholds from $
150
 per share to $
230
 per share and (ii) continued employment through the date the price target is met (with a minimum of 
five years
 of service required after the grant date for vesting). If the price target is met prior to the fifth anniversary of the grant date, the vesting date will be the fifth anniversary of the grant date. Holders of the Performance Awards do not participate in dividends until such awards have met both their market-based and service-based vesting requirements. 
Due to the existence of the service requirement, the vesting period for these awards will vary with each respective tranche as the employees must be employed with the Company at the point in which the market requirement is met with a minimum of 
five years
 of service required after the grant date for vesting. As such, compensation expense will be recognized ratably for each vesting tranche from the grant date to the end of the employee’s minimum service period. The fair value of the awards granted are based on a Monte-Carlo simulation valuation model.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
(In thousands, except share and per share amounts)
In connection with the February 2025 Offering and related unit exchanges, the Company recorded a deferred tax asset in the amount of $
58,700
, which is net of a valuation allowance of $
6,507
, related to the portion of tax benefits that is more likely than not will not be realized. Additionally, in connection with recording of the deferred tax asset for the February 2025 Offering and related unit exchanges, the Company recorded a payable to related parties pursuant to the tax receivable agreement through equity of $
49,029
.
The Company believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets (except those identified above) will be realized based on the Company’s forecasted income. The net change in the valuation allowance was a decrease of $
11,109
.
As of March 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, the Company had 
no
 unrecognized tax positions. The Company does not expect any material increase or decrease in its gross unrecognized tax positions during the next twelve months. If and when the Company does record unrecognized tax positions in the future, any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax positions will be recorded in the income tax expense line in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
The Company files income tax returns as required by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates. In the normal course of business, the Company may be subject to examination by federal and certain state and local tax authorities. As of March 31, 2025, the Company’s federal income tax returns from 2021 remain open and are subject to examination. 
Tax Receivable Agreement
The Company has recorded a liability related to the tax receivable agreement of $
240,648

 and $
11,123
 were made during the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. In the event that the valuation allowance related to tax benefits associated with the tax receivable agreement is released in a future period, an additional estimated payable will be due to the TRA Recipients of $
25,264
.

Shares of the Company’s Class B common stock do not share in the earnings or losses attributable to HLI, and, therefore, are not participating shares. As a result, a separate presentation of basic and diluted EPS of Class B common stock under the two-class method has not been included. Shares of the Company’s Class B common stock are, however, considered potentially dilutive to the Class A common stock because the Class B units to which the Class B common stock corresponds are exchangeable for shares of Class A common stock

(In thousands, except share and per share amounts)
on a 
one
-for-one basis, at which time the share of Class B common stock is surrendered in exchange for a payment of its par value.
The adjustments to net income for dilutive shares are based upon the additional income that would be allocated to HLI for the change in its ownership percentage due to the dilutive shares and adjusted for the incremental income tax expense related to the additional allocated income. Net income (loss) recorded by HLI on a standalone basis will determine if the Class B and Class C units are dilutive or antidilutive in each respective period.

16.  Commitments and Contingencies
Litigation
In the ordinary course of business, the Company may be subject to various legal, regulatory, and/or administrative proceedings from time to time. Although there can be no assurance of the outcome of such proceedings, in the opinion of management, the Company does not believe it is probable that any pending or, to its knowledge, threatened legal proceeding or claim would individually or in the aggregate materially affect its consolidated financial statements.
Incentive Fees
The Partnerships have allocated carried interest still subject to contingencies that did not meet the Company’s criteria for revenue recognition in the amounts of $
1,260,277
 and $
1,221,488
, net of amounts attributable to NCI, at March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
If the Company ultimately receives the unrecognized carried interest, a total of $
315,069
 and $
305,372
 as of March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, would potentially be payable to certain employees and third parties pursuant to compensation arrangements related to carried interest profit-sharing plans. Such amounts have not been recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets or Consolidated Statements of Income as the payment is not yet probable.
Leases
The Company’s leases consist primarily of operating leases for office space and office equipment in various locations around the world, which have remaining lease terms of 
one year
 to 
14
 years. Some leases have the option to extend for an additional term or terminate early.  Short-term lease costs are not material.

Commitments
The Company serves as the investment manager of the Partnerships. The general partner or managing member of each Partnership is generally a separate subsidiary of the Company and has agreed to invest funds on the same basis as the limited partners in most instances. The Company’s aggregate unfunded commitment  to the Partnerships was $
312,215
 and $
267,734
 as of March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
In connection with certain of the Company’s strategic technology investments, a percentage of realized gains will be paid to one of our Co-CEOs for overseeing the initial investments and up to 
15
% may be paid as a discretionary bonus to other employees as those gains are realized. The Company has an unrealized net gain on strategic investments of $
34,058
 as of March 31, 2025.
The Company offers an Employee Investment Program (“EIP”) through which certain employees are able to invest directly into certain Company managed funds as individual limited partners (“LPs”). The employees also have an option to enter into a loan agreement with the Company or a third-party lender to fund committed capital. The loan is collateralized by the underlying LP’s interest in the fund and return of capital distributions are utilized to pay the outstanding loan balance. The Company entered into a separate agreement with the third-party lender to backstop the employee’s performance under the loan with a commitment to purchase the LP interest from the lender at the greater of fair value or the outstanding balance of the loan in the event of a default by the employee. As of March 31, 2025, the total amount of outstanding loans at the third-party lender under the EIP was $
1,280
, and the Company believes the risk of default by an employee to be remote.

Item 9: Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
None.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of March 31, 2025. Our disclosure controls and procedures are intended to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
Based on management’s evaluation, our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at March 31, 2025.
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Our management, with the participation of our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2025, based on the criteria described in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the results of its evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March 31, 2025.
Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm
Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an unqualified attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2025, which is included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 9B. Other Information
Trading Arrangements

 or modified any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of our securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) of the Exchange Act or any non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K).
Item 5.02(e) 
—
 Co-Chief Executive Officer Awards 
On March 11, 2025, our Board upon recommendation by the Compensation Committee approved the grant of the first in a series of five annual awards of 30,000 shares of time-based restricted stock to each of our Co-CEOs (the “Annual Awards”) after determining that performance conditions for fiscal 2025 had been satisfied. These initial Annual Award grants were made on March 14, 2025. The shares subject to each Annual Award grant will vest in equal installments on the four successive anniversaries of the grant date, subject to the continued employment of the applicable Co-CEO. For the four remaining Annual Awards, a one-year performance period (aligned with our fiscal year) will precede each award date, and the satisfaction of certain performance criteria within that performance period will determine whether a grant is made. Our Compensation Committee will establish these performance criteria and will determine if they have been met.
