On January 5, 2023, the Board of Directors approved an amendment to the Company’s certificate of incorporation to complete a 1-for-32 reverse stock split effective January 5, 2023. The effects of the reverse stock split have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements and the footnotes.

Overview

Company Overview

Dave was launched in 2017 to provide a faster, more transparent, and lower-cost alternative to traditional financial institutions, particularly for those living paycheck to paycheck. Inspired by the story of David vs. Goliath, we set out to challenge legacy banking by leveraging technology to expand financial access and improve consumer financial health. Through our mobile-first platform, we deliver innovative financial products designed to help underserved consumers manage their money more effectively. Our mission is to level the financial playing field by providing intuitive, transparent, and accessible solutions that empower our Members to navigate life’s financial challenges with confidence.

We have engineered a purpose-driven platform designed to deliver on our mission, making a significant impact across the stakeholder groups we serve. Since our inception, more than 16 million Members have signed up for the Dave app, with over 12 million having used at least one of our products. We have provided Members with more than $15 billion in ExtraCash, offering critical liquidity when they need it most. To further support our communities, we have donated approximately $23 million to charity and important causes since inception.

Customers value our products, as demonstrated by more than 700,000 App Store reviews with an average 4.8-star rating as of February 2025. Our business model is built on transparency and customer alignment and building relationships with our Members that drive positive outcomes for both them and our business.

At the core of our success is a world-class team dedicated to delivering on our mission. Dave has been recognized by Built In as a Best Place to Work for five consecutive years, reinforcing our commitment to both our Members and employees.

Market Opportunity

The U.S. financial system has historically failed to address the needs of the millions of Americans who are living paycheck to paycheck. According to the Financial Health Network (“FHN”) in 2024, approximately 180 million Americans are classified as financially “coping” or “vulnerable” representing over 70% of the U.S. population, up from 66% in 2021. A December 2024 report by PYMNTS also found that 65% of U.S. consumers were living paycheck to paycheck, up from 60% a year earlier. This market includes both young and financially challenged individuals who have trouble managing cash flow, have minimal savings, regularly overdraft, and pay high fees for access to financial services. FHN research estimates there is approximately $38 billion of fees paid annually for access to basic checking services, including account maintenance fees, overdraft fees and ATM fees and that financially vulnerable and coping populations pay over $200 billion in annual fees and interest for short-term credit. We believe these insights are supported by a Dave study of our Members which reveals that traditional financial institutions charge consumers between $350-$400 of fees annually for access to basic checking services. We also believe these trends underscore a growing need for better financial solutions and illustrate the depth of our total addressable market (“TAM”), which we estimate to be approximately 180 million Americans that do not have access to affordable and effective banking solutions.

57

We believe that these high costs are the result of the cost structure of incumbents. With expensive brick-and-mortar bank branch networks, antiquated technology, large employee bases, and inefficient customer acquisition strategies, legacy institutions have significant costs to serve their customers, which drives the high price that customers have to pay for access to their services. By leveraging world-class technology and harnessing the power of data and artificial intelligence, we believe that we have dramatically reduced the costs to serve customers in this market. Through this structural advantage, we are able to provide increased access to banking and credit products at lower costs, resulting in a much stronger value proposition to our Members.

Comparability of Financial Information

Our future results of operations and financial position may not be comparable to historical results as a result of the consummation of the Business Combination.

Key Factors Affecting Operating Results

Our future operating results and cash flows are dependent upon a number of opportunities, challenges and other factors, including Member growth and activity, product expansion, competition, industry trends and general economic conditions.

Member Growth and Activity

We have made significant investments in our platform, and our business is dependent on continued Member growth, as well as our ability to offer new products and services and generate additional revenues from our existing Members using such additional products and services. Member growth and activity are critical to our ability to increase our scale, capture market share and earn an attractive return on our technology, product and marketing investments. Growth in Members and Member activity will depend heavily on our ability to continue to offer attractive products and services and the success of our marketing and Member acquisition efforts.

Product Expansion

We aim to develop and offer a best-in-class financial services platform with integrated products and services that improve the financial well-being of our Members. We have invested and continue to make significant investments in the development, improvement and marketing of our financial products and are focused on continual growth in the number of products we offer that are utilized by our Members.

Competition

We face competition from several financial services-oriented institutions. In our reportable segment, as well as in potential new lines of business, we may compete with more established institutions, some of which have more financial resources. We compete at multiple levels, including competition among other financial institutions and lenders in our ExtraCash business, competition for deposits in and debit card spending from our Dave Banking product from traditional banks and digital banking products and competition for subscribers to our personal financial management tools. Some of our competitors may at times seek to increase their market share by undercutting pricing terms prevalent in that market, which could adversely affect our market share for any of our products and services or require us to incur higher member acquisition costs.

Concentration

We rely on agreements with Evolve, currently our only active bank partner, to provide ExtraCash and other deposit accounts, debit card services and other transaction services to us and our Members. See Part II Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for additional information. Given the size and consistent growth of our Member base as well as how our product capabilities have been expanding, we recently announced an additional financial institution with which we will partner.

58

Industry Trends/General Economic Conditions

We expect economic cycles to affect our business, financial performance, and financial condition. Macroeconomic conditions, including, but not limited to, regulatory uncertainty, fluctuating interest rates, inflation, unemployment rates, and consumer sentiment may impact consumer spending behavior and consumer demand for financial products. Although the Company’s business operations have not been materially impacted as of the date of this report, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected due to the ongoing nature of these macroeconomic factors. Interest rates have remained elevated over the last two years which has increased the costs of borrowing on our Debt Facility. Higher interest rates also often lead to higher payment obligations, which may reduce the ability of Members to repay their ExtraCash and, therefore, lead to increased delinquencies, write-offs and decreased recoveries. We also believe that higher interest rates may increase demand for ExtraCash as consumers seek additional sources of liquidity to help them fund higher costs of living. Additionally, higher levels of unemployment could adversely impact Members’ income levels and, hence, the ability of Members to repay, which could lead to deterioration in credit performance. We believe that our underwriting engine is well positioned to evaluate credit risk in a higher unemployment environment as it analyzes bank account transaction data to assess, nearly in real-time, changes in Members’ income, spending, savings, and employment status. We also believe that demand for ExtraCash may increase in periods of higher unemployment as consumers seek additional sources of liquidity to help them meet their financial obligations.

Key Components of Statements of Operations

Basis of presentation

Currently, we conduct business through one operating segment which constitutes a single reportable segment. For more information about our basis of presentation, refer to Note 2 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Dave included in this report.

Service based revenue, net

Service based revenue, net primarily consists of optional express processing fees, optional tips, overdraft service fees and subscriptions charged to Members, net of processor-related costs associated with ExtraCash disbursements. Service based revenue, net also consists of lead generation fees from our Side Hustle advertising partners and revenue share from our surveys partner.

Transaction based revenue, net

Transaction based revenue, net primarily consists of interchange and ATM revenues from our Checking Product, net of interchange and ATM-related fees, fees earned from funding and withdrawal-related transactions, volume support from a certain co-branded agreement, fees earned related to the Rewards Product for Members who make debit card spending transactions at participating merchants and deposit referral fees and are recognized at the point in time the transactions occur, as the performance obligations are satisfied and the variable consideration is not constrained.

Operating expenses

We classify our operating expenses into the following five categories:

Provision for Credit Losses

The provision for credit losses primarily consists of an allowance for expected credit losses at a level estimated to be adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the outstanding ExtraCash receivables, inclusive of outstanding processing fees and tips along with outstanding amounts aged over 120 days or which become uncollectible based on information available to us during the period. We currently estimate the allowance balance required using historical loss and collections experience, and, if relevant, the nature and volume of the portfolio, economic conditions, and other factors such as collections trends and cash collections received subsequent to the balance sheet date. Changes to the allowance have a direct impact on the provision for credit losses in the consolidated statement

59

of operations. We consider ExtraCash receivables, aged more than 120 days or which become uncollectible based on information available to us as impaired. All impaired ExtraCash receivables, are deemed uncollectible and subsequently written off and are a direct reduction to the allowance for credit losses. Subsequent recoveries, if any, of Member ExtraCash receivables, written-off are recorded as a reduction to ExtraCash receivables, resulting in a reduction to the allowance for credit losses and a corresponding reduction to the provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of operations when collected.

Processing and Servicing Costs

Processing and servicing fees consist of fees paid to our processing partners for the recovery of ExtraCash, optional tips, optional express processing fees, overdraft service fees and subscriptions. These expenses also include fees paid for services to connect Members’ bank accounts to our application. Except for processing and servicing fees associated with ExtraCash originations which are recorded net against revenue, all other processing and service fees are expensed as incurred.

Advertising and Marketing

Advertising and marketing expenses consist primarily of fees we pay to our advertising and marketing platform partners. We incur advertising, marketing and production-related expenses for online, social media and television advertising and for partnerships and promotional advertising. Advertising and marketing expenses are expensed as incurred although they typically deliver a benefit over an extended period.

Compensation and Benefits

Compensation and benefits expenses represent the compensation, inclusive of stock-based compensation and benefits, that we provide to our employees and the payments we make to third-party contractors. While we have an in-house customer service function, we employ third-party contractors to conduct call center operations and handle routine customer service inquiries and support.

Other Operating Expenses

Other operating expenses consist primarily of technology and infrastructure (third-party Software as a Service or “SaaS”), commitments to charity, checking product costs (program expenses, association fees, processor fees, losses from Member-disputed transactions, bank card fees and fraud), depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and intangible assets, legal fees, rent, certain sales tax related costs, office related expenses, public relations costs, professional services fees, travel and entertainment, and insurance. Costs associated with technology and infrastructure (third-party SaaS), depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and intangible assets, legal fees, rent, office related expenses, public relations costs, professional services fees, travel and entertainment, and insurance vary based upon our investment in infrastructure, business development, risk management and internal controls and are generally not correlated with our operating revenues or other transaction metrics.

Other (income) expenses

Other (income) expenses consist of interest income, interest expense, gain on extinguishment of convertible debt, earnout liabilities fair value adjustments and changes in fair value of warrant liabilities.

Provision for income taxes

Provision for income taxes consists of the federal and state corporate income taxes accrued on income resulting from the sale of our services.

Service based revenue, net—

Processing fees, net

Processing fees, net of processor costs associated with ExtraCash originations, for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $218.8 million, an increase of $66.3 million, or 43%, from $152.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in transacting Members, increases in total ExtraCash origination volume from approximately $3.6 billion to approximately $5.1 billion year over year and average ExtraCash origination amounts that increased from $152 to $170 as of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively.

As a percentage of total ExtraCash volume, processing fees remained relatively flat, year over year. Additionally, the average processing fees Members paid to expedite ExtraCash increased modestly, while the percentage of Members that chose to pay a processing fee to expedite ExtraCash remained relatively flat for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively. Going forward, we expect processing fees to increase as expedited ExtraCash volume and average expedited ExtraCash sizes increase, however, processing fees have not always trended ratably. Prior to the implementation of percentage-based processing fees in late 2023, processing fees did not scale ratably with expedited ExtraCash origination amounts.

Tips

Tips for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $67.6 million, an increase of $10.6 million, or 19%, from $56.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to higher tips from Members due primarily to increases in transacting Members, increases in total ExtraCash origination volume from approximately $3.6 billion to approximately $5.1 billion year over year and average ExtraCash origination amounts that increased from $152 to $170 as of the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

As a percentage of total ExtraCash volume, tips decreased from 1.57% to 1.33% for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The average tip Members chose to leave increased modestly while the percentage of Members that chose to leave a tip decreased modestly for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. Tip amounts may not always trend ratably as tips can vary depending on the total amount of the ExtraCash, amount of tips Members choose to leave and the percentage of Members who leave a tip.

Subscriptions

Subscriptions for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $24.6 million, an increase of $3.1 million, or 15%, from $21.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in paying Members on our platform.

61

Other

Other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $0.5 million, a decrease of $0.9 million, or 65% from $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower revenues resulting from the elimination of our Legacy Rewards product in 2023.

Transaction based revenue, net

Transaction based revenue, net for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $35.7 million, an increase of $8.8 million, or 33%, from $26.9 million, for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to interchange revenue earned from the growth in Members engaging with our Checking Product and card spend of $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of 40%, from $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023, in addition to increases in fees earned from Members' funding and withdrawal-related transactions, offset by an increase of $1.2 million in interest due to Members.

Provision for credit losses
—The provision for credit losses totaled $54.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $58.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease of $3.8 million, or 6%, was primarily attributable to a decrease of $10.3 million related to ExtraCash receivables aged over 120 days and those that have become uncollectible based on information available to us, offset by an increase in provision expense of $6.6 million related to ExtraCash receivables aged 120 days and under.

The decrease in provision expense of $10.3 million related to ExtraCash receivables aged over 120 days and those which have become uncollectible based on information available to us, period over period was attributed to improved collections performance due primarily to underwriting modifications related to ExtraCash eligibility requirements and risk detection. This decrease in provision expense occurred despite increases in transacting Members, average ExtraCash originations from $152 to $170 and total ExtraCash origination volume from $3.6 billion to approximately $5.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively. All impaired ExtraCash receivables deemed uncollectible are subsequently written-off and are a direct reduction to the allowance for credit losses.

The increase in provision expense of $6.6 million related to ExtraCash receivables aged 120 days and under was primarily attributed to an increase in receivables outstanding related to the 43% increase in ExtraCash origination volume, offset by improved collections performance during the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. This resulted in an increase to the allowance for credit losses and corresponding increase in provision expense during the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023. We anticipate volatility in ExtraCash receivables outstanding each period as they are directly correlated with the timing and volume of Member ExtraCash originations and collections during the last 120 days prior to the end of the period.

Historical loss and collections rates utilized in the calculation of the provision for credit losses improved slightly as compared to historical rates due to continued improvement in historical collections performance. Any changes to our historical loss and collections experience directly affect the historical loss rates utilized in the calculation of the

62

allowance for credit losses. The changes in the allowance for credit losses, period over period, have a direct impact on the provision for credit losses.

For information on the aging of ExtraCash receivables and a roll-forward of the allowance for credit losses, refer to the tables in Note 5 ExtraCash Receivables, Net in the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Dave included in this report.

Processing and service costs
—Processing and servicing costs totaled $30.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $28.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase of $1.5 million, or 5%, was primarily driven by an increase in process transaction volume year over year, offset by technology enhancements made to our ExtraCash payments structure along with discounts and cost savings due to rebates and price reductions from our processors.

Advertising and marketing
—Advertising and marketing expenses totaled $44.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $48.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease of $3.5 million, or 7%, was primarily attributable to reductions in our non-media marketing spend including our brand refresh, efficiencies achieved by partnering with new marketing agencies, and optimizing our promotion strategy. We also improved the efficiency of our media investment by reallocating marketing spend to more efficient channels via improved measurement, tracking and attribution.

Compensation and benefits
—Compensation and benefits expenses totaled $107.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $94.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase of $12.1 million, or 13%, was primarily attributable to the following:

•
an increase in stock-based compensation of $10.7 million, primarily due to the vesting of certain performance-based restricted stock units during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, offset by a reduction in stock-based compensation expense related to stock options granted in prior years that have fully vested;

•
an increase in payroll and related costs of $1.8 million, primarily due to average headcount and salary increases and bonuses; offset by

•
a decrease in contractor and consulting fees of $0.4 million due to the average increase in employee headcount and corresponding reduction in external support for IT security, finance, marketing, design and customer service resources.

Other operating expenses
—Other operating expenses totaled $75.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $70.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase of $4.9 million, or 7%, was primarily attributable to the following:

•
an increase in legal fees of $3.5 million primarily due to ongoing litigation, settlement, compliance, employment and general corporate related matters;

•
an increase in depreciation and amortization of $2.1 million, primarily due to increased internally developed capitalized costs, and depreciation related to leasehold improvements and equipment purchases; 

•
an increase in certain expenses related to our checking product of $1.8 million, primarily attributable to processing fees, card fees and fraud related costs associated with the growth in Members and the number of transactions processed; and

•
an increase in technology & infrastructure expenses of $0.5 million, primarily due to increased costs to support the growth of our business and development of new products and features; offset by a

63

•
a decrease in insurance related costs of $1.1 million, primarily related to reductions in director and officer insurance premiums; 

•
a decrease in charitable contribution expenses of $0.9 million, primarily due to decreased amounts pledged to charitable meal donations related to Members' tips; and

•
a decrease in administrative expenses of $1.1 million, primarily due to reductions in investor and public relations fees, accounting related fees, bank service charges and other administrative expenses.

Interest income
— Interest income totaled $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease of $2.3 million, or 44%, was primarily attributable to an average lower balance of investments held during the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.

Interest expense
— Interest expense totaled $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease of $3.8 million, or 32%, was primarily attributable to a reduction of interest expense related to the repurchase of the convertible note with FTX Ventures Ltd. in January 2024.

Gain on extinguishment of convertible debt
— The gain on extinguishment of convertible debt totaled $33.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $0 for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to the repurchase of the $105.7 million outstanding balance of the convertible note with FTX Ventures Ltd. for $71.0 million in January 2024. The gain was reduced by unamortized debt issuance costs of $0.03 million at the extinguishment date and third-party costs totaling $1.3 million in conjunction with the settlement of the convertible note.

Changes in fair value of earnout liability
—Changes in fair value of earnout liabilities totaled an expense of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to a benefit of $0.02 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. The increase of $1.0 million, was primarily attributable to fair value adjustments associated with certain earnout shares liability due to increases in our underlying Class A Common Stock price as of the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.

Changes in fair value of warrant liability
—Changes in fair value of warrant liability totaled an expense of $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to total a benefit of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in expense of $2.0 million, or 765%, was primarily attributable to fair value adjustments associated with our public and private warrant liabilities due to increases in our publicly traded warrants price and underlying Class A Common Stock price for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.

Provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased by approximately $2.4 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily due to a significant increase in income for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, including a 
nonrecurring 
gain on extinguishment of convertible debt of $33.4 million.

Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022

A discussion regarding our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the results for the year ended December 31, 2022 can be found under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Dave – Results of Operations” in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on 
March 5, 2024,
 which is available on the SEC’s website at 
www.sec.gov
.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe the following non-GAAP measure is useful in evaluating our operational performance. We use the following non-GAAP measure to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that the non-GAAP financial information may be helpful in assessing our operating performance and facilitates an alternative comparison among fiscal periods. The non-GAAP financial measure is not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for GAAP reporting measures.

Adjusted EBITDA

“Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as net income (loss) adjusted for interest expense, net, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and other discretionary items determined by management. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe that the use of Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that, when evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion.

Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA on a supplemental basis. The reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA below should be reviewed, and no single financial measure should be relied upon to evaluate our business.

In the past, we have financed our operations primarily from cash receipts from service and transaction-based revenues, equity financings, borrowings under the Debt Facility, issuances of convertible notes and funds received as a result of the business combination. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and investments balance was $90.3 million and $155.9 million, respectively.

As an early-stage company, the expenses we have incurred since inception are consistent with our strategy and approach to capital allocation. We expect to incur significant expenses in accordance with our operating plan as we continue to expand and improve upon our financial platform.

Our ability to access capital when needed is not assured and, if capital is not available to us when, and in the amounts needed, we could be required to delay, scale back or abandon some or all of our development programs and other operations, which could materially harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.

We believe that our cash on hand should be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements and fund our operations for a period of at least 12 months from the date of this report. We may raise additional capital through private or public equity or debt financings. The amount and timing of our future funding requirements, if any, will depend on many factors, including the pace and results of our product development efforts. No assurances can be provided that additional funding will be available at terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital, we may significantly curtail our operations, modify existing strategic plans and/or dispose of certain operations or assets.

As of December 31, 2024, we were not in compliance with a specific debt covenant under our existing Debt Facility with Victory Park Management, LLC (“Agent”). In particular, a breach existed relating to the Minimum Receivable Loan-to-Value ("LTV Ratio"), which exceeded the allowable limits set forth in the covenant. The Agent, on behalf of its lenders, provided a one-time limited waiver of this covenant, effective from October 18, 2024 until June 30, 2025. This waiver is solely for that period and for addressing this specific breach, and does not constitute a waiver of any default or event of default under the Debt Facility.

Material Cash Requirements

In the normal course of business, we enter into various agreements with our vendors that may subject us to minimum annual requirements. While our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity, we believe that we will be able to adequately fulfill these obligations through cash generated from operations and from

66

our existing cash balances. Dave does not have any “off-balance sheet arrangements,” as defined by the SEC regulations.

Although we have fully implemented our remote employee workforce strategy in the U.S., we have not closed our leased office locations. We are required to continue making our contractual payments until our operating leases are formally terminated or expire. Our remaining leases have terms of approximately 1 to 4 years as of December 31, 2024, and we had a total lease liability of $0.6 million. See Note 13, Leases in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our lease liabilities as of December 31, 2024.

In the near term, we expect to continue to generate ExtraCash originations relying primarily on our balance sheet cash and Debt Facility, as needed. Interest payments on term loan borrowings under the Debt Facility are required to be made on a monthly basis. At December 31, 2024, $75.0 million of term loans under the Debt Facility were outstanding. See Note 11, Debt Facility in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this report.

Additionally, we also had certain contractual payment obligations for interest owed under the $100.0 million Note we issued and sold pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement entered into with FTX Ventures. Interest payments relating to the Note were required to be made or added to the outstanding principal on a semi-annual basis. On January 29, 2024, we repurchased the $105.5 million outstanding balance of the Note as of December 31, 2023 for $71.0 million. For more information on the Note Purchase Agreement with FTX Ventures, see Note 9, Convertible Note.

We may use cash to acquire businesses and technologies. The nature of these potential transactions, however, makes it difficult to predict the amount and timing of such cash requirements.

Cash Flows From Operating Activities

We recorded net income of $57.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, and a net loss of $48.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. We reported cash flows provided by operating activities of $125.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and cash flows provided by operating activities of $33.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, cash provided by operating activities increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 due to decreases in the provision for credit losses, processing costs, marketing and compensation and benefits across the organization. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 included net income of $57.9 million, and excluding non-cash impacts, included an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $8.2 million and an increase in receivables related to revenue from ExtraCash of $6.2 million. These changes were offset by an increase in accrued expenses of $4.1 million, an increase in legal settlement accrual of $3.8 million, an increase in non-current liabilities of $2.9 million, an increase in accounts payable of $1.3 million, an increase in other current liabilities of $0.3 million and a decrease in prepaid income taxes of $0.1 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2023, cash provided by operating activities increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 due to decreases in the provision for credit losses, processing costs, marketing and compensation and benefits across the organization.

These changes were offset primarily by a decrease in prepaid income taxes of 0.7 million, a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $3.3 million and an increase in accrued expenses of $1.7 million.

Cash Flows From Investing Activities

During the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was $45.8 million. This amount included payments for internally developed software costs of $7.3 million, the purchase of property and equipment of $0.3 million, net ExtraCash originations and collections of $111.5 million, the purchase of investments of $111.3 million, and the purchase of marketable securities of $59.3 million, offset by the sale of marketable securities of $60.1 million and the sale and maturity of investments of $183.7 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2023, net cash used in investing activities was $14.4 million. This amount included payments for internally developed software costs of $7.9 million, the purchase of property and equipment of $0.7 million, net ExtraCash originations and collections of $63.0 million, the purchase of investments of $120.0 million, and the purchase of marketable securities of $34.4 million, offset by the sale of marketable securities of $33.7 million and the sale and maturity of investments of $177.9 million.

Cash Flows From Financing Activities

During the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was $71.0 million, which primarily consisted of the $72.3 million paydown of the convertible note with FTX Ventures Ltd. and associated costs, offset by $1.3 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock for stock option exercises.

During the year ended December 31, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was $0.02 million, which primarily consisted of payments of $0.01 million for fractional shares that resulted from our reserve stock spilt and $0.03 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock for stock option exercises.

Critical Accounting Estimates

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our critical accounting estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis, including those related to the following:

(i) Allowance for credit losses; and

(ii) Income taxes.

Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the accounting estimates discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these estimates relate to the more significant areas involving management’s judgments and estimates. Please refer to Note 2 in our accompanying consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

While our significant accounting estimates are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, we believe that the following accounting estimates require a greater degree of judgment and complexity and are the most critical to understanding our financial condition and historical and future results of operations.

68

Allowance for Credit Losses

ExtraCash receivables from contracts with Members as of the balance sheet dates are recorded at their original receivable amounts reduced by an allowance for expected credit losses. We pool our ExtraCash receivables, all of which are short-term in nature and arise from contracts with Members, based on shared risk characteristics to assess their risk of loss, even when that risk is remote. We use an aging method and historical loss rates as a basis for estimating the percentage of current and delinquent ExtraCash receivables balances that will result in credit losses. We consider whether the conditions at the measurement date and reasonable and supportable forecasts about future conditions warrant an adjustment to our historical loss experience. In assessing such adjustments, we primarily evaluate current economic conditions, expectations of near-term economic trends and changes in customer payment terms and collection trends. For the measurement dates presented herein, given our methods of collecting funds, and that we have not observed meaningful changes in our customers’ payment behavior, we determined that our historical loss rates remained most indicative of our lifetime expected losses. We immediately recognize an allowance for expected credit losses upon the origination of the ExtraCash receivable. Adjustments to the allowance each period for changes in the estimate of lifetime expected credit losses are recognized in operating expenses—provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of operations.

When we determine that an ExtraCash receivable is not collectible, the uncollectible amount is written-off as a reduction to both the allowance and the gross asset balance. Subsequent recoveries are recorded when received and are recorded as a recovery of the allowance for expected credit losses. Any change in circumstances related to a specific ExtraCash receivable may result in an additional allowance for expected credit losses being recognized in the period in which the change occurs.

Income Taxes

We follow ASC 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”), which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the period in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more-likely-than-not that the asset will not be realized.

ASC 740 provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained in a court of last resort, based on the technical merits. If more-likely-than-not, the amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon examination, including compromise settlements. For tax positions not meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, no tax benefit is recorded. We have estimated $2.0 million and $1.3 million of uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to state income taxes and federal and state research and development tax credits.

We are subject to income tax in jurisdictions in which we operate, including the United States. For U.S. income tax purposes, we are taxed as a Subchapter C corporation.

We recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes. We recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Based upon management’s assessment of all available evidence, we have concluded that it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, will not be realized.

Emerging Growth Company Status

We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and have elected to take advantage of the benefits of the extended transition period for new or revised financial accounting standards. We expect to remain an emerging growth company until December 31, 2025 and to continue to take advantage of the benefits of the extended transition period, although we may decide to early adopt such new or revised accounting standards to the extent permitted by such standards. We expect to use this extended transition

69

period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and non-public companies until the earlier of the date we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. This may make it difficult or impossible to compare our financial results with the financial results of another public company that is either not an emerging growth company or is an emerging growth company that has chosen not to take advantage of the extended transition period exemptions because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. See Note 2 of our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this report for the recent accounting pronouncements adopted and the recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

In addition, we intend to rely on the other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act for emerging growth companies. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if we intend to rely on such exemptions, we are not required to, among other things: (a) provide an auditor’s attestation report on our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; (b) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd- Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; (c) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the consolidated financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis); and (d) disclose certain executive compensation-related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the Chief Executive Officer’s compensation to median employee compensation.

We will remain an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act until the earliest of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following March 4, 2026, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion, (c) in which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under the rules of the SEC, which means the market value of our common equity that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of the prior fiscal year’s second fiscal quarter; and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the previous three years.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
 PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Dave Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Dave Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Note 1 Organization and N
ature of Business
Company Overview
Dave ("the Company") was launched in 2017 to provide a faster, more transparent, and lower-cost alternative to traditional financial institutions, particularly for those living paycheck to paycheck. Inspired by the story of David vs. Goliath, the Company set out to challenge legacy banking by leveraging technology to expand financial access and improve consumer financial health. Through its fully integrated, mobile-first platform, the Company delivers innovative financial products designed to help underserved consumers manage their money more effectively. The Company's mission is to level the financial playing field by providing intuitive, transparent, and accessible solutions that empower its Members to navigate life’s financial challenges with confidence.
Platform and Products
ExtraCash

ExtraCash is a 
0
% interest overdraft product offered through the Company's bank partner that provides Members with up to $
500
 of credit to bridge liquidity gaps between paychecks. Using its proprietary AI-powered underwriting system, CashAI, the Company analyzes a Member’s checking account transaction data to determine eligibility and set the credit amount. This fully automated process requires no credit check and does not rely on FICO or credit bureau data. Once an ExtraCash transaction is initiated, repayment is scheduled based on the Member’s forecasted next paycheck or deposit date.

The Company designs and manages the complete risk management value chain—including underwriting, fraud and risk mitigation, payment processing, servicing, and collections. Each ExtraCash transaction is underwritten by CashAI when a Member accesses the Dave App, enabling near real-time evaluation of transaction data. This approach determines the optimal amount a Member can responsibly repay, delivering benefits for both the Member and the business.

Dave Checking:

Dave Checking is a digital demand deposit account offered through its bank partner with premium features, no account minimums or corresponding fees, and FDIC pass-through insurance. 
Members can open a Dave Checking account in minutes through the Dave mobile application, add funds to their account, and begin spending using a Dave Checking virtual debit card. Dave Checking accounts also include a physical Dave branded debit Mastercard (“Dave Card”) that can be used for everyday purchases and spending transactions as well as at any of the approximately 
40,000
 MoneyPass ATM network locations to make no-fee withdrawals at these in-network ATMs.

Dave Checking revenues are primarily driven by merchant interchange, incentives from Mastercard, interest on deposits paid by our partner banks, and other ancillary fees paid by customers (e.g. out of network ATM fees, instant withdrawal fees).

Personal Financial Management

Budget:

The Budget tool utilizes historical bank account data to identify recurring and common charges, enabling Members to anticipate upcoming transactions that may affect their account balances. It also provides timely notifications when there is a risk of an overdraft.

Side Hustle: Side Hustle is a streamlined job application portal for Dave Members to find supplemental or temporary work. The portal focuses on “gig economy,” part-time, seasonal, remote and other flexible types of employment opportunities. Members can apply to dozens of jobs in-app using saved information and credentials. A side hustle can be an important part of a Member’s long-term financial health, as it allows Members to quickly address unexpected expenses or cash needs with incremental income.

Surveys: The Company's Surveys product allows for additional earning opportunities, allowing Members to take paid surveys anytime within the Dave mobile application. This functionality drives engagement within the Dave ecosystem and deepens its relationship to its Members’ financial wellbeing.

The Company
 generates monthly subscription revenue from Members enrolled in the Company's Personal Financial Management service.

Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

On January 4, 2023, the Board approved an amendment to the Company’s certificate of incorporation to complete a 
1-for-32
 reverse stock split effective January 5, 2023
. At a special meeting held on December 13, 2022, stockholders approved the reverse stock split. The primary goal of the reverse stock split was to bring the Company’s stock price above the share bid price requirement for continued listing on Nasdaq. The effects of the reverse stock split have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements and the footnotes.
Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and a variable interest entity (“VIE”). All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.

In accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 810, Consolidation, the Company consolidates any VIE of which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity; however, a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities, such as VIEs, through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests. ASC 810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if that party has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company does not consolidate a VIE in which it has a majority ownership interest when it is not considered the primary beneficiary. The Company evaluates its relationships with its VIEs on an ongoing basis to help ensure that the Company continues to be the primary beneficiary. The Company is considered the primary beneficiary of Dave OD Funding I, LLC (“Dave OD”), as it has the power over the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Dave OD and has the obligation to absorb expected losses and the right to receive expected benefits that could be significant, in accordance with accounting guidance. As a result, the Company consolidated Dave OD and all intercompany accounts have been eliminated. The carrying value of Dave OD’s assets and liabilities, after elimination of any intercompany transactions and balances are shown in the consolidated balance sheets. The assets of Dave OD are restricted and may only be used to settle obligations of Dave OD.
Use of Estimates

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. The Company’s estimates are based on its historical experience and various other factors that the Company believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The Company’s critical accounting estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis including those related to the:

(i) Allowance for credit losses; and
(ii) Income taxes.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Service Based Revenue, Net:
Service based revenue, net primarily consists of optional tips, optional processing fees, and subscriptions charged to Members, net of processor costs associated with ExtraCash originations. ExtraCas
h receivables are treated as financial receivables under ASC 310 Receivables (“ASC 310”) and processing fees, net and tips are also accounted for in accordance with ASC 310.

Processing Fees, Net
Processing fees and overdraft service fees apply when a Member requests expedited ExtraCash. At the Member’s election, the Company expedites the funding of ExtraCash funds within hours of the ExtraCash approval, as opposed to the customary two or three business days for ExtraCash that is transferring via the ACH network. Processing fees are accounted for as non-refundable loan origination fees and are recognized as revenues over the average expected contractual term of its ExtraCash transactions.
Costs incurred by the Company to originate ExtraCash are treated as direct loan origination costs. These direct loan origination costs are netted against ExtraCash-related income over the average expected contractual term of an ExtraCash. Direct origination costs recognized as a reduction of ExtraCash-related income during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023
, were $
3.5
 million and $
3.3
 million, respectively.

Tips
The Company encourages, but does not contractually require its Members who receive ExtraCash to leave a discretionary tip. For accounting purposes, the Company treats tips as an adjustment of yield to ExtraCash and are recognized over the average expected contractual term of its ExtraCash receivables.

Subscriptions
The Company accounts for subscriptions in accordance with ASC 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
(“ASC 606”). Under ASC 606, the Company must identify the contract with a Member, identify the performance obligations in the contract, determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies the performance obligations. For revenue sources that are within the scope of Topic 606, the Company fully satisfies its performance obligations and recognizes revenue in the period it is earned as services are rendered. Transaction prices are typically fixed, charged on a periodic basis or based on activity. Because performance obligations are satisfied as services are rendered and the transaction prices are fixed, there is little judgment involved in applying ASC 606 that significantly affects the determination of the amount and timing of revenue from contracts with the Company’s Members.

Subscription fees are received on a monthly basis from Members who subscribe to the Company’s application. The Company continually fulfills its obligation to each Member over the subscription term. The series of distinct services represents a single

82

performance obligation that is satisfied over time. The Company recognizes revenue ratably as the Member receives and consumes the benefits of the platform throughout the monthly contract period.

Price concessions granted to Members who have insufficient funds when subscription fees are due and not collected are forms of variable consideration under the Company’s contracts with Members. For price concessions, the Company has elected, as an accounting policy, to account for price concessions for the month at the end of the reporting month based on the actual amounts collected from Members.

Other service based revenue consists of lead generation fees from the Company’s Side Hustle advertising partners and revenue share from the Company's Surveys partners.
Transaction Based Revenue, Net:
Transaction based revenue, net primarily consists of interchange and ATM revenues from the Company’s Checking Product, net of certain interchange and ATM-related fees, fees earned from funding and withdrawal-related transactions, volume support from a certain co-branded agreement, fees earned related to the Rewards Product for Members who make debit card spending transactions at participating merchants and deposit referrals and are recognized at the point in time the transactions occur, as the performance obligations are satisfied and the variable consideration is not constrained. The Company earns interchange fees from Members spend on Dave-branded debit cards, which are reduced by interchange-related costs payable to fulfillment partners. Interchange revenue is remitted by merchants and represents a percentage of the underlying transaction value processed through a payment network. ATM fees earned from the Member’s usage of out-of-network reduced by related ATM transaction costs during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023
, were $
3.1
 million and $
2.6
 million, respectively. ATM-related fees recognized as a reduction of transaction based revenue during the years ended 
December 31, 2024 and 2023
, were $
2.1
 million and $
1.8
 million, respectively.
Processing and Servicing Costs
Processing costs consist of amounts paid to third party processors for the recovery of ExtraCash, tips, processing fees and subscriptions. These expenses also include fees paid for services to connect Member’s bank accounts to the Company’s application. Except for processing and service fees associated with ExtraCash originations, whi
ch are recorded net against revenue, all other processing and service fees are expensed as incurred.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company classifies all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.

Restricted Cash
Restricted cash primarily represents cash held at financial institutions that is pledged as collateral for specific accounts that may become overdrawn.

Marketable Securities
Marketable securities consist of a publicly traded money market mutual fund. The underlying money market instruments are primarily comprised of certificates of deposit and financial company 
asset backed commercial paper.

Investments
Investments consist of corporate bonds and notes, asset backed securities, and government securities and are classified as “available-for-sale,” as the sale of such securities may be required prior to maturity to implement the Company’s strategies. The fair value of investments is determined by quoted prices in active markets with unrealized gains and losses (other than credit related impairment) reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income (loss). For securities with unrealized losses, any credit related portion of the loss is recognized in earnings. If it is more likely than not that the Company will be unable or does not intend to hold the security to recovery of the non-credit related unrealized loss, the loss is recognized in earnings. Realized gains and losses are determined using the specific identification method and recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Any related amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified to earnings (on a pretax basis).

83

ExtraCash Receivables
ExtraCash Receivables include ExtraCash, fees, and tips, net of certain direct origination costs and allowance for credit losses. Management’s intent is to hold ExtraCash Receivables until the earlier of repayment or payoff date. Members’ ExtraCash Receivables are treated as financial receivables under ASC 310 .
ExtraCash Receivables to Members are not interest-bearing. The Company recognizes these ExtraCash Receivables at the origination amount and does not use discounting techniques to determine present value of originations due to their short-term nature.
The Company does not provide modifications to ExtraCash and does not charge late fees.

Allowance for Credit Losses
ExtraCash receivables from contracts with Members as of the balance sheet dates are recorded at their original origination amounts, inclusive of outstanding processing fees and tips, and reduced by an allowance for expected credit losses. The Company pools its ExtraCash receivables, all of which are short-term (average term of approximately 
11 days
) in nature and arise from contracts with Members, based on shared risk characteristics to assess their risk of loss, even when that risk is remote. The Company uses an aging method and historical loss rates as a basis for estimating the percentage of current and delinquent ExtraCash receivables balances that will result in credit losses to derive the allowance for credit losses. The Company considers whether the conditions at the measurement date and reasonable and supportable forecasts about future conditions warrant an adjustment to its historical loss experience. In assessing such adjustments, the Company primarily evaluates current economic conditions, expectations of near-term economic trends and changes in customer payment terms, collection trends and cash collections subsequent to the balance sheet date. For the measurement dates presented herein, given its methods of collecting funds, and that the Company has not observed meaningful changes in its customers’ payment behavior, it determined that its historical loss rates remain most indicative of its lifetime expected losses. The Company immediately recognizes an allowance for expected credit losses at the time of the ExtraCash origination. Adjustments to the allowance each period for changes in the estimate of lifetime expected credit losses are recognized in operating expenses—provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of operations.

When the Company determines that an ExtraCash receivable is not collectible, or after 
120
 days from origination has passed, the uncollectible amount is written-off as a reduction to both the allowance and the gross asset balance. Based on the average ExtraCash outstanding term of approximately 
11
 days, ExtraCash receivables outstanding 
12
 or more days from origination may be considered past due. Subsequent recoveries are recorded when received and are recorded as a recovery of the allowance for expected credit losses. Any change in circumstances related to a specific Member ExtraCash receivables may result in an additional allowance for expected credit losses being recognized in the period in which the change occurs.
Internally Developed Software
Internally developed software is capitalized when preliminary development efforts are successfully completed, management has authorized and committed project funding, it is probable that the project will be completed, and the software will be used as intended. Capitalized costs consist of salaries and other compensation costs for employees incurred for time spent on upgrades and enhancements to add functionality to the software and fees paid to third-party consultants who are directly involved in development efforts. These capitalized costs are included on the consolidated balance sheets as intangible assets, net. Other costs are expensed as incurred and included within other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Capitalized costs for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023
, were $
7.3
 million and $
7.6
 million, 
respectively. Additionally, $
7.7
 million related to the Company's legacy advance application software asset has been fully amortized and written off as of June 2023 and $
1.4
 million related to internally developed software no longer in service was fully amortized and written off as of December 31, 2024.
Amortization of internally developed software commences when the software is ready for its intended use (i.e., after all substantial testing is complete). Internally developed software is amortized over its estimated useful life of 
3
 years.
The Company’s accounting policy is to perform annual reviews of capitalized internally developed software projects to determine whether any impairment indicators 
are 
present as of December 31, or whenever a change in circumstances suggests an impairment indicator is present. If any impairment indicators are present, the Company will perform a recoverability test by comparing the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributed to the asset group to their

84

carrying 
value. If the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the remaining use of the asset (i.e., cash flows when testing recoverability) are less than the asset group’s carrying value, the Company will determine the fair value of the asset group and recognize an impairment loss as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value. If based on the results of the recoverability test, no impairment is indicated as the remaining undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value of the software asset group, the carrying value of the asset group as of the assessment date is deemed fully recoverable. In addition, the Company evaluates the remaining useful life of an intangible asset that is being amortized each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. If the estimate of an intangible asset’s remaining useful life is changed, the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset shall be amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives ranging from 
3
 to 
7
 years using the straight-line method. Maintenance and repair costs are charged to operations as incurred and included within other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company assesses the impairment of long-lived assets, primarily property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets, whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable. If the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows from an asset is less than the carrying amount of the asset, the Company estimates the fair value of the assets. The Company measures the loss as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its fair value calculated using the present value of estimated net future cash flows.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”), provides a single definition of fair value and a common framework for measuring fair value as well as disclosure requirements for fair value measurements used in the consolidated financial statements. Under ASC 820, fair value is determined based upon the exit price that would be received by a company to sell an asset or paid by a company to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants, exclusive of any transaction costs. Fair value measurements are determined by either the principal market or the most advantageous market. The principal market is the market with the greatest level of activity and volume for the asset or liability. Absent a principal market to measure fair value, the Company uses the most advantageous market, which is the market from which the Company would receive the highest selling price for the asset or pay the lowest price to settle the liability, after considering transaction costs. However, when using the most advantageous market, transaction costs are only considered to determine which market is the most advantageous and these costs are then excluded when applying a fair value measurement. ASC 820 creates a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in the valuation techniques to derive fair values. The basis for fair value measurements for each level within the hierarchy is described below, with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest.
Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2—Observable inputs other than Level 1 quoted prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that are not active for identical or similar assets and liabilities, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3—Valuations are based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement of the assets or liabilities. Inputs reflect management’s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model.
Concentration of Risk
Financial 
instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, principally consist of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, ExtraCash receivables, and accounts receivable. The Company’s cash and cash equivalents

85

and 
restricted cash in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured limits were approximately 
$
61.1
 million and $
40.9
 million at 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company’s payment processors also collect cash on the Company’s behalf and will hold these cash balances temporarily until they are settled the next business day. Also, the Company does not believe its marketable securities are exposed to any significant credit risk due to the quality and nature of the securities in which the money is held.

The Company relies on agreements with Evolve, currently its only active bank partner, to provide ExtraCash and other deposit accounts, debit card services and other transaction services to them and their Members. Given the size and consistent growth of the Company's Member base as well as how its product capabilities have been expanding, the Company recently announced an additional financial institution with which it will partner. Refer to Note 21, Subsequent Events for further details regarding the Program Agreement entered into with Coastal Community Bank to become a sponsor for the Company's banking and ExtraCash products.
No Member individually exceeded 10% or more of the Company’s ExtraCash receivables balance as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023
.
Leases
ASC 842, Leases (“ASC 842”) requires lessees to recognize most leases on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding right-of-use asset. Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated present value of fixed lease payments over the lease term. Leases are classified as financing or operating which will drive the expense recognition pattern. Lease payments on short-term leases are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. At the time of a lease abandonment, the operating lease right-of-use asset is derecognized, while the corresponding lease liability is evaluated by the Company based any remaining contractual obligations as of the lease abandonment date.

The Company leases office space under two separate leases, both of which are considered operating leases. Options to extend or terminate a lease are considered as part of calculating the lease term to the extent that the option is reasonably certain of exercise. The leases do not include the options to purchase the leased property. The depreciable life of assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term. Covenants imposed by the leases include letters of credit required to be obtained by the lessee.
The incremental borrowing rate (“IBR”) represents the rate of interest the Company would expect to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments under similar terms. When determinable, the Company uses the rate implicit in the lease to determine the present value of lease payments. As the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock Option Awards:

ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”), requires the estimate of the fair value of all stock-based payments to employees, including grants of stock options, to be recognized in the statement of operations over the requisite service period. Under ASC 718, employee option grants are generally valued at the grant date and those valuations do not change once they have been established. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model. As allowed by ASC 718, the Company’s estimate of expected volatility is based on its peer company average volatilities, including industry, stage of life cycle, size, and financial leverage. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant valuation. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur. Subsequent modifications to outstanding awards result in incremental cost if the fair value is increased as a result of the modification.

Restricted Stock Unit Awards:

Restricted stock units (“RSUs”) are valued on the grant date. The fair value of the RSUs that vest based solely on a service condition is equal to the estimated fair value of the Company’s Class A common stock on the grant date. This compensation

86

cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. For RSUs that contain both a market condition and a service condition, market volatility and other factors are taken into consideration in determining the grant date fair value and the related compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of each separately vesting tranche, regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied, provided that the requisite service has been provided. These costs are a component of stock-based compensation expense, presented within compensation and benefits in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur.

Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Awards:

Performance-based RSUs are valued on the grant date and the compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period if and when the Company concludes it is probable that the performance metrics will be satisfied. The grant-date fair value of the awards are not subsequently remeasured; however, the Company reassesses the probability of vesting at each reporting period and records a cumulative adjustment to compensation expense based on the likelihood the performance metric will be achieved. These costs are a component of stock-based compensation expense, presented within compensation and benefits in the consolidated statements of operations.

Income Taxes

The Company follows ASC 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”), which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more-likely-than-not that the asset will not be realized.

ASC 740 provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained in a court of last resort, based on the technical merits. If more-likely-than-not, the amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 
50
% likely of being realized on examination, including compromise settlements. For tax positions not meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, no tax benefit is recorded. The Company has estimated $
2.0
 million and $
1.3
 million of uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to state income taxes. and federal and state research and development tax credits.

The Company’s policy is to recognize interest expense and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense within the statement of operations. The Company recognized $
0.036
 million and $
0.005
 million of interest expense and penalties as a component of income tax expense during the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. There were $
0.052
 million and $
0.016
 million of accrued interest expense and penalties as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Net Income (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Stockholders
The Company has two classes of participating securities (Class A common stock, par value $
0.0001
 per share, and Class V common stock, par value $
0.0001
 per share) issued and outstanding as of 
December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (the Class V common stock and together with the Class A common stock, the “Common Stock”). The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of the Class A common stock and Class V common stock are identical, except with respect to voting.

Basic net income (loss) attributable to holders of Common Stock per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) attributable to holders of Common Stock by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding.
Diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to holders of common stock is computed by dividing net income (loss) per share attributable to stockholders and the weighted-average number of shares outstanding and the effect of potentially dilutive stock options, warrants, and restricted stock using the treasury stock method.
The following table sets forth the computation of the Company’s basic and diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to holders of common stock (

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted:

In December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-09, Income Taxes - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The amendments require enhanced disclosures in connection with an entity's effective tax rate reconciliation, income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction, and clarification on uncertain tax positions and related financial statement impacts. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this amendment on its financial statement disclosures.

In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses and in January 2025, the FASB issued ASU No. 2025-01, Clarifying the Effective Date. The amendments requires 
entities to disclose the following amounts in each relevant income statement expense captions: purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset amortization. Entities are also required to disclose the total amount of selling expense and the entities definition of selling expenses
. The amendments, as clarified by ASU No. 2025-01, are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, with early adoption permitted, and may be applied retrospectively or prospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its financial statement disclosures.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements:

In November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The amendments require disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis. The amendments also require companies with a single reportable segment to provide all disclosures required by this amendment and all existing segment disclosures in Accounting Standards Codification 280, Segment Reporting. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024. While the adoption has no impact on the Company's financial statements, it has resulted in incremental disclosures within the footnotes to its consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 20 Segment Information in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details.

In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13, 
Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”)
. ASU 2016-13 introduced a new credit loss methodology, the Current Expected Credit Losses (“CECL”) methodology, which requires earlier recognition of credit losses, while also providing additional transparency about credit risk. The CECL methodology utilizes a lifetime “expected credit loss” measurement objective for the recognition of credit losses for loans, held-to maturity debt securities, trade receivables and other receivables measured at amortized cost at the time the financial asset is originated or acquired. Subsequent to the issuance of ASU 2016-13, the FASB issued several additional ASUs to clarify implementation guidance, provide narrow-scope improvements and provide additional disclosure guidance. The Company adopted this ASU on January 1, 2023 and determined that ASU 2016-13 had no material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

Note 9 Convertible Note

On March 21, 2022, the Company entered into a Convertible Note Purchase Agreement (“Note Purchase Agreement”) with FTX Ventures Ltd., (the “Purchaser”) owner of FTX US (“FTX”), providing for the purchase and sale of a convertible note in the initial principal amount of $
100.0
 million (the
 “Note”). The Note bore interest at a rate of 
3.00
%

94

per 
year (compounded semiannually), payable semi-annually in arrears on June 30th and December 31st of each year. Interest may be paid in-kind or in cash, at the Company’s option. 
Forty-eight months
 (the “Maturity Date”) after the date of the initial issuance of the Note (the “Issuance Date”), the Company would pay the Purchaser the sum of (i) the outstanding principal amount of the Note, plus (ii) all accrued but unpaid interest thereon, plus (iii) all expenses incurred by the Purchaser (the “Redemption Price”). Payment of the Redemption Price on the Maturity Date will constitute a redemption of the Note in whole.

105.7
 million outstanding balance of the Note as of January 29, 2024 for $
71.0

Note 10 Warrant Liabilities
As of December 31, 2024
, there were 
6,344,021
 public warra
nts (“Public Warrants”) outstanding and 
5,100,214

private placement warrants (“Private Warrants”) outstanding. Public Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. No fractional Public Warrants were issued upon separation of the units into their component parts upon the closing of the Business Combination and only whole Public Warrants trade. The Public Warrants are exercisable, provided that the Company continues to have an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available (or the Company permits holders to exercise their Public Warrants on a cashless basis and such cashless exercise is exempt from registration under the Securities Act).
The Company filed a registration statement covering the shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants and the Private Warrants. If the Company’s shares of Class A Common Stock are at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that they satisfy the definition of a “covered security” under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, the Company may, at its option, require holders of Public Warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event the Company so elects, it will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, and in the event the Company does not so elect, it will use its best efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available.
The Public Warrants and the Private Warrants have an exercise price of $
368.00
 per share, subject to adjustments and will expire 
five years
 after the completion of the Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.
Redemption of Public Warrants when the price per share of Class A Common Stock equals or exceeds $
576.00
:
Once the Public Warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the outstanding Public Warrants for cash:
•         in whole and not in part;
•         at a price of $
0.01
 per warrant;
•         upon a minimum of 
30
 days prior written notice of redemption; and if, and only if, the closing price of Class A Common Stock equals or exceeds $
576.00
 per share (as adjusted) for any 
20
 trading days within a 
30
-trading day period ending on the 
third
 trading day prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders.
The Company will not redeem the Public Warrants as described above unless an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is effective and a current prospectus relating to those shares of Class A Common Stock is available throughout the 30-day redemption period.
Redemption of Public Warrants for when the price per share of Class A Common Stock equals or exceeds $
320.00
:

95

Once the Public Warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the outstanding Public Warrants:
•         in whole and not in part;

•        at $
0.10
 per warrant upon a minimum of 
30
 days’ prior written notice of redemption provided that holders will be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis prior to redemption and receive that number of shares determined by reference to an agreed table based on the redemption date and the “fair market value” (as defined below) of the Class A Common Stock; and
•        if, and only if, the closing price of Class A Common Stock equals or exceeds $
320.00
 per Public Share (as adjusted) for any 
20
 trading days within the 
30
-trading day period ending 
three
 trading days bef
ore the Company sends notice of redemption to the warrant holders.
If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a “cashless basis,” as described in the warrant agreement. The exercise price and number of shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the Public Warrants will not be adjusted for issuance of Class A Common Stock at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the Public Warrants.
The Private Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants, except that the Private Placement Warrants will be non-redeemable so long as they are held by VPC Impact Acquisition Holdings Sponsor III, LLC, which was the sponsor of VPCC and an affiliate of certain of VPCC’s officers and directors prior to the Business Combination, (the “Sponsor”) or its permitted transferees. If the Private Warrants are held by someone other than the Sponsor or its permitted transferees, the Private Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants.
Contemporaneously with the execution of the Debt Facility, the Company issued warrants to the Lenders as consideration for entering into the Debt Facility, representing a loan commitment fee. The warrants vest and become exercisable based on the Company’s aggregated draw on the Debt Facility in incremental $
10.0
 million tranches and terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) the fifth anniversary of the occurrence of a qualified financing event and (ii) the consummation of a liquidity event. The holders of the warrants have the ability to exercise their right to acquire a number of common shares equal to 
0.2
% of the fully diluted equity of the Company as of the closing date (“Equity Closing Date”) of the Company’s next equity financing with proceeds of at least $
40.0
 million (“Qualified Financing Event”) or immediately prior to the consummation of a liquidity event. The exercise price of the warrants 
is the greater of (i) 
80
% of the fair market value of each share of Common Stock at the Equity Closing Date and (ii) $
120.0656
 per share, 
subject to certain down-round adjustments. The warrants meet the definition of a derivative under ASC 815 and will be accounted for as a liability at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period with the changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. The initial offsetting entry to the warrant liability was an asset recorded to reflect the loan commitment fee. The loan commitment fee asset will be amortized to interest expense over the commitment period of four years. The Company estimated the fair value of the warrants at the issuance date to be $
0.1
 million using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Determining the fair value of these warrants under this model requires subjective assumptions. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment.
Immediately prior to the close of the Business Combination, all, 
or 
1,664,394
 of
 the vested warrants were exercised and net settled for 
14,087

shares of Legacy Dave’s Class A Common Stock after applying the Exchange Ratio.

Note 11 Debt Facility

In January 2021, Dave OD Funding I, LLC (“Borrower”) entered into a delayed draw senior secured loan facility (the “Debt Facility”) with Victory Park Management, LLC (“Agent”), and allowed the Borrower to draw up to $
100
 million from various lenders (the “Lenders”) associated with Victory Park Management, LLC. The Debt Facility had an interest rate of 
6.95
% annually plus a base rate defined as the greater of the 
three-month London interbank offered rate ("LIBOR")
 as of the last business day of each calendar month and 
2.55
%
. Interest is payable monthly in arrears. The Debt Facility contained certain financial covenants, including a requirement to maintain a minimum cash, cash equivalents, or marketable securities balance of $
15.0
 million.

On September 13, 2023, the Company executed the Third Amendment to the Debt Facility with the existing Lenders. The Third Amendment, among other things: (i) increases the secured loan facility commitment amount by $
50
 million to a total of $
150
 million; (ii) extends the maturity date of the Debt Facility from 
January 2025
 to 
December 2026
; (iii) adds a liquidity trigger threshold, measured as of the last day of any calendar month, equal to the lesser of (a) the trailing six-month EBITDA as of such date, (b) the product of (A) the trailing three-month EBITDA as of such date, multiplied by (B) two (2), and (c) zero ($0); (iv) increases the minimum liquidity threshold, a requirement to maintain a minimum cash, cash equivalents, or marketable securities balance, from $
8.0
 million to $
15
 million (v) replaces LIBOR with the secured overnight financing rate ("SOFR") and updates interest rates to the base rate (or if greater, 
SOFR for such date for a 3-month tenor
 and 
3.00
%) plus 
5.00
% per annum on that portion of the aggregate outstanding principal balance that is less than or equal to $75 million, plus the base rate plus 
4.50
% per annum on that portion of the aggregate outstanding principal balance, if any, that is greater than $75 million; (vi) updates prepayment premiums for early or voluntary principal repayments and (vii) the Company's guaranty (the limited guaranty was secured by a first-priority lien against substantially all of the Company's assets) of up to $
25
 million of the Borrower's obligations under the Debt Facility has been terminated.

Payments of the loan draws are due at the following dates: (i) within five business days after the date of receipt by the Borrower of any net cash proceeds in excess of $
0.25
 million in the aggregate during any fiscal year from any asset sales (other than certain permitted dispositions), Borrower must prepay the loans or remit such net cash proceeds in an aggregate amount equal to 
100
% of such net cash proceeds; (ii) within five business days after the date of receipt by Borrower, or the Agent as loss payee, of any net cash proceeds from any destruction or taking, the Borrower must prepay the loans or remit such net cash proceeds in an aggregate amount equal to 100% of such net cash proceeds; (iii) within three business days after the date of receipt by Borrower of any net cash proceeds from the incurrence of any indebtedness of Borrower (other than with respect to permitted borrower indebtedness), the Borrower will prepay the loans or remit such net cash proceeds in an aggregate amount equal to 
100
% of such net cash proceeds; and (iv) (a) if extraordinary receipts are received by Borrower in the aggregate amount in any fiscal year in excess of $
0.25
 million or (b) if an event of default has occurred and is continuing at any time when any extraordinary receipts are received by Borrower, then within five business days of the receipt by Borrower of any such extraordinary receipts, the Borrower must prepay the loans or remit such net cash proceeds in an aggregate amount equal to (x) 
100
% of such extraordinary receipts in excess of $
0.25
 million in respect of clause (a) above and (y) 
100
% of such extraordinary receipts in respect of clause (b) above.

On October 18, 2024, the Company executed the Fourth Amendment to the Debt Facility with the existing Lenders to expand the Company's borrowing capacity. The amendment also 
updates interest rates to the sum of the base rate plus 
5.00
% per annum on the aggregate outstanding principal balance and updates prepayment premiums for early or voluntary principal repayments, 
among other administrative terms. The Fourth Amendment was accounted for as a debt modification and, accordingly, the Company incurred

$
0.03
 million in associated costs which will be recognized within the consolidated statement of operations evenly through maturity date of the Debt Facility, and 
no
 gain or loss was recognized. 
As of December 31, 2024, the Company was not in compliance with a specific debt covenant under its existing Debt Facility. In particular, a breach existed relating to the Minimum Receivable Loan-to-Value ("LTV Ratio"), which exceeded the allowable limits set forth in the covenant. The Agent, on behalf of the Lenders, provided a one-time limited waiver of this covenant, effective from October 18, 2024 until June 30, 2025. This waiver is solely for that period and for addressing this specific breach, and does not constitute a waiver of any default or event of default under the Debt Facility.

As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023
, the Company had drawn $
75.0
 million on the Debt Facility and had made no repayments.

Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies

From time to time, the Company is subject to various other legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, that arise in the ordinary course of business. Other than as described below, management does not believe that any of these proceedings or claims will have a significant adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. However, legal proceedings and claims are subject to many factors that are difficult to predict, so there can be no assurance that, in the event of a material unfavorable result in one or more claims, the Company will not incur material costs.

1. United States of America v. Dave, Inc. and Jason Wilk (filed December 30, 2024 in the United States District Court for the Central District of California)

In January 2023, the Company received a Civil Investigative Demand from the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) staff seeking information in connection with the sale, offering, advertising, marketing or other promotion of cash advance products and online financial services. In response, the Company cooperated with the FTC staff while seeking to engage constructively with the FTC to resolve this matter.

On August 21, 2024, the FTC staff sent the Company a proposed consent order and draft complaint, alleging that the Company had violated Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act ("FTC Act") which prohibits "unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce" and certain provisions of the Restore Online Shoppers’ Confidence Act related to the Company’s platform and offering of the ExtraCash Product (the “Complaint”), and advising that it would recommend the filing of an enforcement action if the Company did not settle the FTC’s claims. The Company engaged in good faith negotiations with the FTC staff to settle the claims but these negotiations were unsuccessful, and on November 5, 2024, the FTC filed the Complaint in the United States District Court for the Central District of California against the Company. The Complaint sought a permanent injunction, monetary relief for an unspecified amount and “other relief as the court determines to be just and proper.” 
The FTC then referred the case to the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”), and on December 30, 2024, the DOJ filed an amended civil complaint in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, naming the Company and our Chief Executive Officer, Jason Wilk as defendants (the "Amended Complaint"). The Amended Complaint alleges that Dave violated Section 5(a) of the FTC Act as well as the Restore Online Shoppers' Confidence Act. The DOJ is seeking injunctive relief, civil penalties, monetary relief and other relief. On February 28, 2025, we filed a motion to dismiss the DOJ’s Amended Complaint.

Although the Company believes that its practices have at all times been in compliance with applicable law, the outcome of any case in litigation is uncertain. Therefore, for the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded a $
7
 million litigation and settlement accrual for this matter. Significant changes in the accrual may be required in future periods as the case progresses and additional information becomes available. At this time, the Company is unable to reasonably predict the possible outcome of this matter due to, among other things, the fact that it raises difficult factual and legal issues and is subject to many uncertainties and complexities. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in the litigation, and the Company may incur a loss in excess of the amount accrued. The defense or resolution of this matter could involve significant monetary costs and have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial results and operations.

Note 13 Leases

In January 2019, the Company entered into a lease agreement with PCJW Properties LLC (“PCJW”) for office space located in Los Angeles, California. The lease term is 
seven years
, beginning January 1, 2019 and ending December 31, 2025. Monthly rent is $
0.02
 million, subject to an annual escalation of 
5
%.

In December 2018, the Company entered into a sublease agreement with PCJW, controlled by Company’s founders (including the Company’s CEO), for general office space next to the aforementioned leased property in Los Angeles, California. The lease term was 
five years
 subject to early termination by either party, beginning November 2018 and ending October 2023. In November 2023, the Company extended 
the sublease for five more years ending October

98

2028. 
Under the terms of the sublease, the current monthly rent is $
0.006
 million, subject to an annual escalation of 
4
%.

All leases were classified as operating and operating lease expenses are presented within Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company does not have any finance leases or sublease arrangements where the Company is the sublessor.

The Company had 
no
 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis as of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023.

99

The Company also has financial instruments not measured at fair value. The Company has evaluated cash (Level 1), restricted cash (Level 1), accounts payable (Level 2), accrued expenses (Level 2) and ExtraCash receivables (Level 3) and believes the carrying value approximates the fair value due to the short-term nature of these balances. The fair value of the debt facility (Level 2) approximates its carrying value.

Marketable Securities:
The Company evaluated the quoted market prices in active markets for its marketable securities and has classified its securities as Level 1. The Company’s investments in marketable securities are exposed to price fluctuations. The fair value measurements for the securities are based upon the quoted prices of similar items in active markets multiplied by the number of securities owned.

Investments:

The following describes the valuation techniques used by the Company to measure the fair value of investments held as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

U.S. Government Securities

The fair value of U.S. government securities is estimated by independent pricing services who use computerized valuation formulas to calculate current values. U.S. government securities are categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

Corporate Bonds and Notes

The fair value of corporate bonds and notes is estimated by independent pricing services who use computerized valuation formulas to calculate current values. These securities are generally categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy or in Level 3 when market-based transaction activity is unavailable and significant unobservable inputs are used.

Asset-Backed Securities
The fair value of these asset-backed securities is estimated by independent pricing services who use computerized valuation formulas to calculate current values. These securities are generally categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy or in Level 3 when market-based transaction activity is unavailable and significant unobservable inputs are used.

Public Warrants:
As discussed further in Note 10, Warrant Liabilities, in January 2022, upon completion of the Business Combination, public warrants were automatically converted to warrants to purchase Common Stock of the Company. These public warrants met the definition of a derivative under ASC 815, and due to the terms of the warrants, were required to be liability classified. This warrant liability was initially recorded as a liability at fair value, with the offsetting entry recorded as a non-cash expense within the statement of operations. The derivative liability was subsequently recorded at fair value at each reporting period, with changes in fair value reflected in earnings. The loss related to the change in fair value of the public warrant liability for year ended December 31, 2024
, was $
0.9

Note 15 Stockholders’ Equity

As of December 31, 2024
, 
no
 shares of preferred stock were outstanding, and the Company has no present plans to issue any shares of preferred stock.

Pursuant to the terms of the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, shares of preferred stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. The Company’s Board of Directors are authorized to fix the voting rights, if any, designations, powers and preferences, the relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and any qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, applicable to the shares of each series of preferred stock. The Company’s Board of Directors are able to, without stockholder approval, issue preferred stock with voting and other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of the common stock and could have anti-takeover effects. The ability of the Company’s Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control or the removal of existing management.
Class A and Class V Common Stock:

The Company’s Board of Directors has authorized two classes of common stock, Class A Common Stock and Class V Common Stock. The Company had authoriz
ed 
500,000,000
 and 
100,000,000
 sh
ares of Class A Common Stock and Class V Common Stock, respectively. Shares of 
Class V Common Stock have 10 votes per share
, while shares of 
Class A Common Stock have one vote per share
. The 
holders of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class V Common Stock shall at all times vote together as a single class on all matters (including the election of directors) submitted to a vote of the Company’s stockholders. 
Class V Common Stock a
re convertible into shares of Class A Common Stock on a 
one
-to-one basis at the option of the holders of Class V Common Stock at any time upon written notice to the Company.
 As of 
December 31, 2024, the Company
 had 
11,551,528
 and 
1,514,082
 of 
Class A Common Stock and Class V Common Stock issued, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, the Company
 had 
11,501,965
 and 
1,514,082
 of 
Class A Common Stock and Class V Common Stock outstanding, respectively.

Note 16 Stock-Based Compensation
In 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted the Dave Inc. 2017 Stock Plan (the “2017 Plan”). The 2017 Plan authorized the award of stock options, restricted stock, and restricted stock units. On January 4, 2022, the stockholders of the Company approved the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”). The 2021 Plan was previously approved, subject to stockholder approval, by the Company’s Board of Directors on January 4, 2022. Upon the consummation of the Business Combination with VPCC, the 2017 Plan was terminated and replaced by the 2021 Plan. The maximum term of stock options granted under the 2021 Plan is 
10 
years and the awards generally vest over a 
four-year
 period.
The Company recognized $
37.3
 million and $
26.7
 million of stock-based compensation expense arising from stock options, restricted stock unit grants and performance-based restricted stock unit grants which is recorded as a component of compensation and benefits in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Stock Options:
Management has valued stock options at their date of grant utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of the underlying shares was estimated by using a number of inputs, including recent arm’s length transactions involving the sale of the Company’s common stock.

Expected term
—The expected term represents the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding. As the Company does not have sufficient historical exercise behavior, it determines the expected life assumption using the simplified method, which is an average of the contractual term of the option and its vesting period.
Risk free interest rate
—The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury issues with an equivalent term approximating the expected life of the options depending on the date of the grant and expected life of the options.

102

Expected dividend yield
—The Company bases the expected dividend yield assumption on the fact that it has never paid cash dividends and has no present intention to pay cash dividends.
Expected volatility
—Due to the Company’s limited operating history and lack of company-specific historical or implied volatility, the expected volatility assumption is based on historical volatilities of a peer group of similar companies whose share prices are publicly available. The Company identified a group of peer companies and considered their historical stock prices. In identifying peer companies, the Company considered the industry, stage of life cycle, size, and financial leverage of such other entities.

At December 31, 2024
, total estimated unrecognized stock-based compensation cost related to unvested stock options prior to that date was $
1.9
 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average remaining period of 
3.3
 years.
On March 3, 2021, the Company granted the Chief Executive Officer stock options to purchase up to 
358,001
 shares of Common Stock in 
nine
 tranches. Each of the nine tranches contain service, market and performance conditions. The market conditions relate to the achievement of certain specified price targets. Vesting commences on the grant date; however, no compensation charges are recognized until the service and performance condition are probable, which is upon the completion of a liquidity event, the achievement of specified price targets for each tranche of shares, and continuous employment. Upon the completion of the business combination with VPCC, the performance condition was met and the Company recorded a cumulative stock-based compensation expense of $
1.9
 million. The options have a strike price of $
23.18
 per share. The Company determined the fair value of the options on the grant date to be $
10.5
 million using a Monte Carlo simulation with key inputs and assumptions such as stock price, term, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate, and volatility. The derived service periods determined by the valuation for each of the nine tranches range from approximately 
3 years
 to approximately 
7 years
. Each tranche will be expensed monthly over the derived service period unless vesting conditions for a particular tranche are met, at which point all remaining compensation charges related to that particular tranche will be expensed in the period in which the vesting conditions were met.

Stock Option Repricing:

In April 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a repricing of certain previously granted and still outstanding vested and unvested stock option awards held by eligible employees, which was approved by stockholders on June 9, 2023. As a result, the exercise price for these awards was lowered to $
5.18
 per share, which was the average per share closing price of the Company’s Class A Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Stock Market for the 30 trading days ending on and including June 9, 2023. No other terms of the repriced stock options were modified, and the repriced stock options will continue to vest according to their original vesting schedules and will retain their original expiration dates. As a result of the repricing, 
134,931
 vested and unvested stock options outstanding as of June 9, 2023, with original exercise prices ranging from $
22.09
 to $
23.18
, were repriced.
The repricing on June 9, 2023 resulted in incremental stock-based compensation expense of $
0.2
 million, of which $
0.14
 million related to vested stock option awards was expensed on the repricing date. The remaining $
0.06
 million related to unvested stock option awards is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the weighted-average vesting period of those awards of approximately 
1.3
 years as of June 9, 2023.

In September 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a repricing of certain previously granted and still outstanding vested and unvested stock option awards held by eight remaining eligible employees excluded from the aforementioned June 9 repricing. As a result, the exercise price for these awards was lowered to $
7.23
 per share, which was the average per share closing price of the Company’s Class A Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Stock Market for the 30 trading days ending on and including September 13, 2023. No other terms of the repriced stock options were modified, and the repriced stock options will continue to vest according to their original vesting schedules and will retain their original expiration dates. As a result of the repricing, 
200,571
 vested and unvested stock options outstanding as of September 13, 2023, with original exercise prices ranging from $
22.09
 to $
23.18
, were repriced.
The repricing on September 13, 2023 resulted in incremental stock-based compensation expense of $
0.2
 million, of which $
0.17
 million related to vested stock option awards was expensed on the repricing date. The remaining $
0.07
 million related to unvested stock option awards is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the weighted-average vesting period of those awards of approximately 
1.0
 years as of September 13, 2023.

During the quarter ended March 31, 2023, th
e Company granted 
629,454
 RSUs to certain employees in 
six
 tranches. 
Each of the six tranches contain service and market conditions. The market conditions relate to the achievement of

certain 
specified price targets. Vesting commences on the grant date and the Company determined the fair value of the RSUs on the grant date to be approximately $
3.0
 million using a Monte Carlo simulation with key inputs and assumptions such as stock price, term, risk-free interest rate, and volatility. The derived service periods determined by the valuation for each of the six tranches range from approximately 
two years
 to approximately 
three years
. Each tranche will be expensed monthly over the derived service period unless vesting conditions for a particular tranche are met, at which point all remaining compensation charges related to that particular tranche will be expensed in the period in which the vesting conditions were met.

During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors approved a modification to the price targets in the market conditions and the addition of alternative performance conditions for 
333,275
 unvested RSUs. The modification of the unvested RSUs resulted in an incremental stock-based compensation expense of 
$
1.0
 million, which will be expensed monthly over the derived service period. The weighted average modification-date fair value of the RSUs was $
5.36
 per award. T
he Company determined the fair value of the RSUs on the modification date using a Monte Carlo simulation with key inputs and assumptions such as stock price, term, risk-free interest rate, and volatility. The derived service periods determined by the valuation range from approximately 
one year
 to approximately 
two years
. The RSUs will be expensed monthly over the derived service period unless vesting conditions for a particular tranche are met, at which point all remaining compensation charges will be expensed in the period in which the vesting conditions were met.

As of December 31, 2024
, the Company had $
32.7
 million of federal and $
86.7
 million of combined state net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards available to offset future taxable income. 
The federal NOLs do not expire; however, they are subject to a utilization limit of 
80
% of taxable income in any given year. The state NOLs begin to expire in 
2031
, except for $
7.3
 million of state NOLs that do not expire. Internal Revenue Code Section 382 imposes limitations on the utilization of NOLs in the event of certain changes in ownership of the Company. The Company has started, but not yet completed a comprehensive analysis of its past ownership changes. Depending upon the degree of those past ownership changes, and any future ownership changes, annual limits may impair the Company’s ability to utilize NOLs and could cause federal and state income taxes to be due sooner than if no such limitations applied.

The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future sources of taxable income. Available positive and negative evidence is considered in making this determination. Due to a history of losses and uncertainty as to future taxable income, realization of the deferred tax assets is limited to the anticipated reversal of deferred tax liabilities. Management determined that there were insufficient federal and state deferred tax liabilities to offset all of the federal and state deferred tax assets at December 31, 2024 and 2023
. Therefore, management believes it is more-likely-than-not that the net federal and state deferred assets will not be fully realized and has recorded valuation allowances in the amounts of $
58.7
 million and $
67.5
 million, as of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
A reconciliation of the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits as of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023 is as follows (dollars in thousands):

As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $
2.0
 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits related to state income taxes and federal and state research and development tax credits. The unrecognized tax benefits of $
0.8
 million 
as of December 31, 2024, would, if recognized, affect the effective tax rate. Although it is possible that the amount of

109

unrecognized 
tax benefits with respect to the uncertain tax positions will increase or decrease in the next 12 months, the Company does not expect material changes.

The Company recognized insignificant amounts of interest expense as a component of income tax expense during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. The income tax related accrued interest amounts were also insignificant as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which it files tax returns, including federal, California, and various other state jurisdictions. The federal statute of limitations remains open for the tax periods December 31, 2021 and thereafter. The statute of limitations for California and various other state jurisdictions remains open for the tax periods December 31, 2020 and thereafter.

Note 19 401(k) Savings Plan

The Company maintains a 401(k) savings plan for the benefit of its employees. Employees can defer up to 
90
% of their compensation subject to fixed annual limits. All current employees are eligible to participate in the 401(k) savings plan. Beginning January 2021, the Company began matching contributions to the 401(k) savings plan equal to 
100
% of the first 
4
% of wages deferred by each participating employee. The Company incurred expenses for employer matching contributions of $
2.1
 million and $
2.2
 million for the years ended 
December 31, 2024 and 2023
, respectively.

Note 20 Segment Information

In accordance with ASC 280, 
Segment Reporting
, the operations of the Company constitute a 
single
 operating and reportable segment. This conclusion reflects the manner in which the Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM"), a joint responsibility, shared by the 
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
, reviews financial information and makes operating decisions. The determination of the reportable segment is based on the nature of the Company’s products and services, as well as the financial performance, on a consolidated entity-wide basis, that are regularly reviewed by the CODM to guide resource allocation and assess performance.

The Company’s operations, all of which are located in the United States, collectively support this single-segment structure. No Member individually contributed to 
10
% or more of the Company’s revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
For further information regarding the Company’s products, services, and the accounting policies applied to its reportable segment, refer to Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies.
The key performance measure used by the CODM to make key operating decisions is consolidated net income (loss), as reported in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
 This measure to assess overall financial performance, identify areas for operation improvement, resource allocation and the allocation of budget between the provision for credit losses, processing and servicing costs, advertising and marketing, compensation and benefits and other operating expenses. This measure helps to ensure alignment with the Company’s long-term financial objectives and supports consistent evaluation across all business activities.

The segment assets and liabilities reviewed by the CODM are those reported on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, with particular focus on available liquidity, including cash, cash equivalents, investments, restricted cash, and ExtraCash receivables, offset by current liabilities and outstanding debt.

The following table presents selected financial information with respect to the Company’s single operating and reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:

Note 21 Subsequent Events

Subsequent events are events or transactions that occur after the consolidated balance sheet date, but before the consolidated financial statements are available to be issued. The Company recognizes in the consolidated financial statements the effects of all subsequent events that provide additional evidence about conditions that existed at the date of the consolidated balance sheet, including the estimates inherent in the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements. The Company’s consolidated financial statements do not recognize subsequent events that provide evidence about conditions that did not exist at the date of the consolidated balance sheet but arose after the consolidated balance sheet date and before the consolidated financial statements were available to be issued.

On March 3, 2025, the Company announced that its subsidiary had entered into a  Program Agreement with Coastal Community Bank to become a sponsor for Dave’s banking and ExtraCash products. Dave Members will begin onboarding to Coastal Community Bank as soon as Q2 2025.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.

None.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective for the year ended December 31, 2024, due to the remediation of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K present fairly in all material respects our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the period presented.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and with the participation of our management, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on the framework in “Internal Control—Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework). Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting were effective as of December 31, 2024.

Remediation of Previously Identified Material Weakness

We previously identified and disclosed the following material weaknesses in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023:

•
We did not maintain sufficient evidence of the performance and/or review of certain internal controls or complete remediation testing for certain internal controls over the period-end financial reporting process addressing financial statement and footnote presentation and disclosures; and

•
We did not maintain sufficient evidence of the performance and/or review of certain IT application controls for information systems that are relevant to the preparation of our financial statements.

112

We implemented our previously disclosed remediation efforts, through enhancing our internal control environment by completing an enterprise-wide risk assessment, process narratives, risk and control matrices, a subsequent gap analysis and performed testing of the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. These efforts also included, but were not limited to: adding additional resources in accounting and finance departments, utilizing third party specialists to assist with complex accounting matters and reduce risks associated with the lack of segregation of duties; implementing a segregation of duties monitoring tool; formalizing accounting policies and procedures; implementing a new enterprise resource planning system to enhance the journal entry review and approval processes; performing bank and balance sheet account reconciliations on a monthly basis; implementing a Sarbanes Oxley compliance and audit management platform; and designing and implementing both IT general controls and IT application controls around our product platform and core applications, including controls over: change management, access security and IT operations. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we completed our testing of the design and operating effectiveness of the implemented controls and concluded them to be effective. As a result, we have concluded that our material weaknesses have been remediated as of December 31, 2024.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Other than described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their cost.
