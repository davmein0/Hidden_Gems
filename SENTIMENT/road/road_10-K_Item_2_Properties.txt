Item 2. Properties
.
Our principal executive office is located in Dothan, Alabama, in a building that we own. As of November 20, 2024, we operated (i) 84 HMA plants in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas, (ii) 17 aggregates facilities in Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Texas and (iii) three liquid asphalt terminals in Alabama, Florida and Texas. Our HMA plants operate at varying levels of utilization depending on market conditions. We maintain offices at our HMA plants, aggregates facilities and terminals as we determine to be appropriate under the circumstances. We consider our plants and other physical properties, whether owned or leased, to be suitable, adequate, and of sufficient productive capacity to meet the requirements of our business. However, we routinely evaluate the purchase or lease of additional properties or the consolidation of our properties as our business needs change.
The table below summarizes the locations and the nature of our ownership or leasehold interest in each of our HMA plants, aggregates facilities and liquid asphalt terminals as of November 20, 2024.
