Item 3. Legal Proceedings. 
Due to the nature of our business, we are involved in routine litigation or subject to other disputes or claims related to our business activities, including, among other things, (i) workers’ compensation claims, (ii) employment-related disputes and (iii) liability issues or breach of contract or tortious conduct claims in connection with the performance of services and provision of materials. We and our affiliates are also subject to government inquiries in the ordinary course of business seeking information concerning our compliance with government construction contracting requirements and various laws and regulations, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty. In the opinion of our management, after consultation with legal counsel, none of the pending inquiries, litigation, disputes or claims against us, if decided adversely to us, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.
Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. 
The information concerning mine safety violations or other regulatory matters required by Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K (17 C.F.R. Part 229.104) is included in Exhibit 95.1 to this report.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in understanding and assessing the trends and significant changes in our results of operations and financial condition. Historical results may not be indicative of future performance. This discussion includes forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under the headings “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” This discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. In this discussion, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures. An explanation of these non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Investors should not consider non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as substitutes for financial information presented in compliance with GAAP.
Overview
We are a civil infrastructure company that specializes in the building and maintenance of transportation networks. Our operations leverage a highly-skilled workforce, strategically located HMA plants, substantial construction assets and select material deposits. We provide construction products and services to both public and private infrastructure projects, with an emphasis on highways, roads, bridges, airports and commercial and residential sites throughout the Sunbelt in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Our public projects are funded by federal, state and local governments and include roads, highways, bridges, airports and other forms of infrastructure. Public transportation infrastructure projects historically have been a relatively stable portion of state and federal budgets and represent a significant share of the United States construction market. Federal funds are allocated on a state-by-state basis, and each state is required to match a portion of the federal funds that it receives. Federal highway spending uses funds predominantly from the Highway Trust Fund, which derives its revenues from fuel taxes and other user fees.
In addition to public infrastructure projects, we provide a wide range of large site work construction and HMA paving services to private construction customers, including commercial and residential developers and local businesses.
Recent Developments
Contract Backlog
At September 30, 2024, our contract backlog was $2.0 billion. Contract backlog is a financial measure that reflects the dollar value of work that the Company expects to perform in the future. We include a construction project in our contract backlog at the time it is awarded and to the extent we believe funding is probable. Our backlog consists of uncompleted work on contracts in progress and contracts for which we have executed a contract but have not commenced the work. For uncompleted work on contracts in progress, we include (i) executed change orders, (ii) pending change orders for which we expect to receive confirmation in the ordinary course of business and (iii) claims that we have made against our customers for which we have determined we have a legal basis under existing contractual arrangements and as to which we consider collection to be probable. Backlog of uncompleted work on contracts under which work was either in progress or had not yet begun was $1.5 billion at September 30, 2024. Our contract backlog also includes low bid/no contract projects, which consist of (i) public bid projects for which we were the low bidder and no contract has been executed and (ii) private work projects for which we have been notified that we are the low bidder or have been given a notice to proceed, but no contract has been executed. Low bid/no contract backlog was $0.5 billion at September 30, 2024.  
2024 Fiscal Year Business Acquisitions
During the 2024 fiscal year, we completed eight acquisitions across four states, adding to or expanding our operations in Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. As a result of these acquisitions, we added eleven asphalt plants and a diverse fleet of equipment and vehicles, as well as skilled construction professionals. For further discussion regarding these transactions, see Note 4 - Business Acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
Lone Star Paving Acquisition

On November 1, 2024, we acquired all of the outstanding membership units of Asphalt, Inc., LLC (doing business as Lone Star Paving) (“Lone Star Paving” and the acquisition, the “Lone Star Acquisition”), a vertically integrated asphalt manufacturing and paving company headquartered in Austin, Texas, with 10 HMA plants, four aggregate facilities, and one liquid asphalt terminal supporting its operations. The aggregate consideration delivered at the closing of the Lone Star Acquisition consisted of (i) $654.2 million in cash (as adjusted pursuant to the Unit Purchase Agreement, dated as of October 20, 2024, by and among the Company, Lone Star Paving, the selling unit holders party thereto, and John J. Wheeler, in his capacity as the selling unit holders’ representative thereunder) and (ii) 3.0 million shares of our Class A common stock. In addition, we agreed to (i) pay cash to the selling unit holders in 
28
Table of Contents
an amount equal to the working capital remaining in Lone Star Paving at closing, as finally determined (subject to adjustments and offsets to satisfy certain indemnification obligations and any purchase price overpayments), to be paid out in quarterly installments over four quarters following the closing, and (ii) purchase from the selling unit holders for $30.0 million in cash an entity that owns certain real property following receipt of specified operational entitlements by such entity. The cash paid at closing was funded from the proceeds of the Term Loan B (as defined below). For more information about the Lone Star Acquisition, see Note 27 - Subsequent Events to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.   
Term Loan B Credit Agreement

On November 1, 2024, we entered into a Term Loan Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, BofA Securities, Inc., PNC Capital Markets LLC, Regions Capital Markets, a division of Regions Bank, and TD Securities (USA) LLC, each as joint lead arranger and joint bookrunner, and certain other lenders party thereto (the “Term Loan B Credit Agreement”). The Term Loan B Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured first lien term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $850.0 million, which amount was fully drawn on November 1, 2024 (the “Term Loan B”). A portion of the proceeds of the Term Loan B was used to finance the cash portion of the consideration for the Lone Star Acquisition, including the repayment of certain outstanding indebtedness of Lone Star Paving and its subsidiaries at closing. The remaining loan proceeds were or will be used (i) to repay the Company’s outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility provided by the Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement (as defined below), (ii) to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the foregoing debt financing transactions and Lone Star Acquisition and (iii) for working capital and other corporate purposes as permitted by the Term Loan B Credit Agreement. For more information about the Term Loan

B

Credit Agreement, see Note 27 - Subsequent Events to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.  
Credit Agreement Amendments
In May 2024, we and certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries entered into a Third Amendment to our Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended from time to time, the “Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement”) to, among other things, (i) increase the aggregate commitments under the revolving credit facility from $325.0 million to $400.0 million, (ii) reallocate $125.0 million of borrowings previously outstanding under the revolving credit facility to our term loan, (iii) add three new banks to our lender syndicate, (iv) provide for an additional incremental credit facility of up to $200.0 million and (v) update certain affirmative and negative covenants thereunder. Additionally, on October 30, 2024, we entered into a Fourth Amendment to the Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement to, among other things, permit (i) the Lone Star Acquisition, (ii) entry into the Term Loan B Credit Agreement, and (iii) certain liens to be granted to secure the indebtedness incurred under the Term Loan B Credit Agreement on a 
pari passu
 basis with the liens securing the Company’s obligations under the Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement.  For further discussion regarding the Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement and the foregoing amendments, see Note 11 - Debt and Note 27 - Subsequent Events to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
Stock Repurchase Program
In April 2024, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which up to $40 million is available to purchase shares of our outstanding Class A common stock through September 30, 2025. We utilize the stock repurchase program to minimize the dilutive impact of awards granted under our equity incentive plans and to repurchase shares opportunistically. Shares of our Class A common stock may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions at prevailing market prices, in privately negotiated transactions or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws, including Rule 10b5-1 plans. The stock repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any shares of Class A common stock, and the stock repurchase program may be modified, suspended, extended or terminated at any time by our board of directors. The actual timing, number and value of shares of Class A common stock repurchased are determined by a committee of the board of directors at its discretion and depend on a number of factors, including the market price of our Class A common stock, capital allocation alternatives, general market and economic conditions and other corporate considerations. During fiscal 2024, we repurchased a total of 173,741 shares of Class A common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $10.0 million.
Seasonality
The activity of our business fluctuates due to seasonality because our business is primarily conducted outdoors. Therefore, seasonal changes and other weather-related conditions, in particular extended snowy, rainy or cold weather and major weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, tropical storms and heavy snows, can adversely affect our business and operations through a decline in both the use of our products and the demand for our services. In addition, construction materials production and shipment levels follow activity in the construction industry, which typically occurs in the spring, summer and fall. Warmer and drier weather during our third and fourth fiscal quarters typically result in higher activity and revenues during the second half of our fiscal year. Our first and second fiscal quarters typically have lower levels of activity due to adverse weather conditions. Our third fiscal quarter varies greatly with spring rains and wide temperature variations. A cool, wet spring increases drying time on projects, which can delay revenues in the third fiscal quarter, while a warm, dry spring may facilitate earlier project commencement dates.

How We Assess Performance of Our Business
Revenues
We derive our revenues predominantly by providing construction products and services for both public and private infrastructure projects, with an emphasis on highways, roads, bridges, airports and commercial and residential sites in the southeastern United States. Our projects represent a mix of federal, state, municipal and private customers. We also derive revenues from the sale of HMA, aggregates and liquid asphalt cement to customers. We recognize revenues derived from projects as we satisfy our performance obligations over time (formerly known as the percentage-of-completion method), measured by the relationship of total cost incurred compared to total estimated contract costs (cost-to-cost input method). Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability, including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements, may result in revisions to estimated costs and income, and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. Revenues derived from the sale of HMA, aggregates and liquid asphalt cement are recognized when the risks associated with ownership have passed to the customer.
Gross Profit
Gross profit represents revenues less cost of revenues. Cost of revenues consists of all direct and indirect costs associated with construction contracts, including raw materials, labor, equipment costs, depreciation, lease expenses, subcontract costs and other expenses at our HMA plants, aggregates mining facilities and liquid asphalt cement terminal. Our cost of revenues is directly affected by fluctuations in commodity prices, primarily liquid asphalt and diesel fuel. From time to time, when appropriate, we limit our exposure to changes in commodity prices by entering into forward purchase commitments. In addition, our public infrastructure contracts often provide for price adjustments based on fluctuations in certain commodity-related product costs. These price adjustment provisions are in place for most of our public infrastructure contracts, and we seek to include similar provisions in our private contracts.
Depreciation, Depletion, Accretion and Amortization
Property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost or, if acquired as a business combination, at fair value. Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. Amortization expense is the periodic expense related to leasehold improvements, intangible assets and liabilities. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the life of the underlying asset or the remaining lease term. Our intangible assets and liabilities were recognized as a result of certain acquisitions and are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets and liabilities.  Mineral reserves are depleted in accordance with the units-of-production method as aggregates are extracted, using the initial allocation of cost based on proven and probable reserves.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses include costs related to our operational offices that are not allocated to direct contract costs and expenses related to our corporate offices. These expenses consist primarily of salaries and personnel costs for our administration, finance and accounting, legal, information systems, human resources and certain managerial employees. General and administrative expenses also include acquisition expenses, audit, consulting and professional fees, stock-based compensation expense, travel, insurance, office space rental costs, property taxes and other corporate and overhead expenses.
Gain on Sale of Property, Plant and Equipment
In the normal course of business, we sell construction equipment for various reasons, including when the cost of maintaining the asset exceeds the cost of replacing it. The gain or loss on the sale of property, plant and equipment reflects the difference between the carrying value at the date of disposal and the net consideration received from the sale of equipment during the period.
Gain on Facility Exchange
As part of our continued growth strategy, we may exchange or sell facilities in order to generate capital for use in connection with other strategic initiatives. The gain or loss on the exchange or sale of a facility reflects the difference between the net carrying value of the facility at the date of disposal and the consideration received from the exchange or sale during the period.
Interest Expense, Net
Interest expense, net primarily represents interest incurred on our long-term debt, such as the Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility, as well as the changes in fair values of interest swap agreements and amortization of deferred debt issuance costs. These amounts are partially offset by interest income earned on short-term investments of cash balances in excess of our current operating needs.

Other Key Performance Indicators — Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin
Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before, as applicable from time to time, (i) interest expense, net, (ii) provision (benefit) for income taxes, (iii) depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization, (iv) share-based compensation expense, (v) loss on the extinguishment of debt, and (vi) expenses associated with non-routine acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA Margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues for each period. These metrics are supplemental measures of our operating performance that are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. These measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of our operating performance. We present Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin because management uses these measures as key performance indicators, and we believe that securities analysts, investors and others use these measures to evaluate companies in our industry. Our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin may not be comparable to similarly named measures reported by other companies. Potential differences may include differences in capital structures, tax positions and the age and book depreciation of intangible and tangible assets.
The following table presents a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA and the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA Margin for the periods presented (in thousands, except percentages):

In periods commencing prior to September 30, 2023, we historically included within the definition of Adjusted EBITDA an adjustment for management fees and expenses related to our management services agreement with an affiliate of SunTx Capital Partners, a member of our control group. Effective October 1, 2023, the term of the management services agreement was extended to October 1, 2028. As a result of the term extension, we no longer view the management fees and expenses paid under the management services agreement as a non-recurring expense. Accordingly, periods commencing subsequent to September 30, 2023 do not include an adjustment for management fees and expenses, and we have recast comparative Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 to conform to the current definition.

Revenues.
 Revenues for fiscal 2024 increased $260.3 million, or 16.7%, to $1.8 billion from $1.6 billion for fiscal 2023. The increase included $154.0 million of revenues attributable to acquisitions completed during or subsequent to fiscal 2023 and an increase of approximately $106.3 million of revenues in our existing markets from contract work and sales of HMA and aggregates to third parties. The 6.8% increase in revenue in our existing markets was due to strong demand in both public and private work.
Gross Profit.
 Gross profit for fiscal 2024 increased $61.9 million, or 31.5%, to $258.3 million from $196.4 million for fiscal 2023. The increase in gross profit was primarily the result of the 16.7% increase in revenues for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 and a higher gross profit margin. The higher gross profit margin was due to (i) efficient utilization of our plants and equipment fleet and (ii) completion of new backlog with more favorable margins.
General and Administrative Expenses.
 General and administrative expenses for fiscal 2024 increased $24.6 million, or 19.3%, to $151.5 million from $126.9 million for fiscal 2023. The increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 was the result of (i) an $8.1 million increase attributable to general and administrative expenses associated with the operations of businesses acquired subsequent to September 30, 2023, (ii) a $6.6 million increase in management personnel payroll and benefits, (iii) a $4.3 million increase in share-based compensation expense, and (iv) a $5.6 million increase in other general and administrative expenses.
Gain on Sale of Property, Plant and Equipment
.
 Gain on sale of property, plant and equipment for fiscal 2024 decreased $2.6 million, or 36.4%, to $4.5 million from $7.0 million for fiscal 2023. The decrease was primarily the result of a $1.3 million gain on the sale of an excess office building and higher disposals of equipment and components during fiscal 2023.
Gain on Facility Exchange
.
 There was no gain on facility exchange for fiscal 2024 compared to a gain on facility exchange of $5.4 million for fiscal 2023. The gain in fiscal 2023 was the result of the disposition of a quarry in North Carolina. In connection with 
32
Table of Contents
this transaction, we acquired three HMA manufacturing plants and certain related assets located in the Nashville, Tennessee metro area. 
Interest Expense, Net.
 Interest expense, net for fiscal 2024 increased $1.7 million, or 9.9%, to $19.1 million compared to $17.3 million for fiscal 2023. The increase in interest expense, net was primarily due to an increase in the average principal debt balance outstanding.
Provision for Income Taxes.
 Our effective tax rate was 25.1% for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023.
Net Income.
 Net income increased $19.9 million, or 40.7%, to $68.9 million for fiscal 2024 compared to $49.0 million for fiscal 2023. The increase in net income was primarily a result of higher gross profit, partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses and interest expense and decreased gains from the facility exchange and sales of property, plant and equipment, all as described above.
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin.
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin were $220.6 million and 12.1%, respectively, for fiscal 2024, compared to $172.6 million and 11.0%, respectively, for fiscal 2023. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin resulted primarily from a $19.9 million increase in net income and a $13.8 million increase in depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization.  For a description of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, as well as a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, see above under the heading “How We Assess Performance of Our Business — Other Key Performance Indicators — Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin.”

Operating Activities
During fiscal 2024, cash provided by operating activities, net of acquisitions, was $209.1 million, primarily as a result of:
•
net income of $68.9 million, reflecting, among other things, $92.9 million of depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization, deferred income taxes of $22.7 million, share-based compensation expense of $14.4 million, and gain on sale of property, plant and equipment of $4.5 million;
•
an increase in contracts receivable including retainage of $6.6 million as a result of higher overall revenues due to acquisitions and growth in existing markets;
•
an increase in inventories of $15.5 million due to increased inventories from acquisitions, growth in existing markets, higher inventory costs and normal fluctuations in our inventory cycle;
•
an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $13.0 million, primarily due to the timing of payments under our insurance policies and other expenses;
•
an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $18.3 million due to an increase in construction activity; and
•
a net increase in the difference between billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts of $30.4 million due to the timing of performing and closing projects.

Investing Activitie
s
During fiscal 2024, cash used in investing activities was $307.6 million, of which $231.8 million related to acquisitions completed in the period, $87.9 million was invested in property, plant and equipment and $5.5 million was invested in restricted investments. These amounts were partially offset by $14.1 million of proceeds from the sale of equipment and $3.6 million of proceeds from the sale of restricted investments.
During fiscal 2023, cash used in investing activities was $143.4 million, of which $91.8 million related to acquisitions completed in the period, $97.8 million was invested in property, plant and equipment and $11.4 million was invested in restricted investments. These amounts were partially offset by $17.7 million of proceeds from the sale of equipment, $37.0 million of proceeds from the facility exchange and $2.9 million of proceeds from the sale of restricted investments.
Financing Activities
During fiscal 2024, cash provided by financing activities was $126.1 million. We received $210.2 million in proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, net of debt issuance costs and discounts, which was partially offset by $72.8 million of principal payments on long-term debt and purchase of treasury stock of $11.3 million.
During fiscal 2023, cash used in financing activities was $0.3 million. We received $103.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, net of debt issuance costs and discounts, which was offset by $103.1 million of principal payments on long-term debt and the purchase of treasury stock of $0.2 million.
Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement

During fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, we and each of our subsidiaries were parties to the Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement, which provides for the Term Loan A and the Revolving Credit Facility. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had $392.2 million and $283.8 million, respectively, of principal outstanding under the Term Loan A, $122.9 million and $93.1 million, respectively, of principal outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, and availability of $268.8 million and $222.1 million, respectively, under the Revolving Credit Facility, including reduction for outstanding letters of credit. The obligations of our subsidiaries under the Term Loan A and the Revolving Credit Facility are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets.  
The Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement requires us to satisfy certain financial covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.20-to-1.00 and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.50-to-1.00, subject to certain adjustments. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, our fixed charge coverage ratio was 3.15-to-1.00 and 2.56-to-1.00, respectively, and our consolidated leverage ratio was 1.81-to-1.00 and 1.72-to-1.00, respectively.
From time to time, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge against the risk of changes in interest rates. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, the aggregate notional value of these interest rate swap agreements was $300.0 million, and the fair value was $11.6 million and $26.9 million, respectively, which is included within other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Term Loan B Credit Agreement 
On November 1, 2024, we entered into the Term Loan B Credit Agreement, which provides for a senior secured first lien term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $850.0 million, which amount was fully drawn on November 1, 2024. A portion of the proceeds of the Term B Loan was used to finance the cash portion of the consideration for the Lone Star Acquisition, including the repayment of certain outstanding indebtedness of Lone Star Paving and its subsidiaries at closing. The remaining loan proceeds were or will be used (i) to repay a portion of our outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility provided by the Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement, (ii) to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the foregoing debt financing transactions and Lone Star Acquisition and (iii) for working capital and other corporate purposes as permitted by the Term Loan B Credit Agreement.

Capital Requirements and Sources of Liquidity
During fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, our capital expenditures were approximately $87.9 million and $97.8 million, respectively. Our capital expenditures are typically made during the same fiscal year in which they are approved. At September 30, 2024, our commitments for capital expenditures were not material to our financial condition or results of operations on a consolidated basis. For fiscal 2025, we expect total capital expenditures to be $130.0 million to $140.0 million. Our capital expenditure budget is an estimate and is subject to change. 
Historically, we have required significant amounts of cash in order to make capital expenditures, purchase materials and fund our organic expansion into new markets. Our working capital needs are driven by the seasonality and growth of our business, with our cash requirements increasing in periods of growth. Additional cash requirements resulting from our growth include the costs of additional personnel, production and distribution facilities, enhancements to our information systems, integration costs related to any acquisitions and our compliance with laws and rules applicable to public companies. 
Furthermore, on April 12, 2024, we announced that our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which up to $40.0 million is available to purchase shares of our outstanding Class A common stock through September 30, 2025. We intend to utilize the stock repurchase program to minimize the dilutive impact of awards granted under our equity incentive plans and to repurchase shares opportunistically. Shares of Class A common stock may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions at prevailing market prices, in privately negotiated transactions or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws, including Rule 10b5-1 plans. The stock repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any shares of Class A common stock, and the stock repurchase program may be modified, suspended, extended or terminated at any time by our board of directors. The actual timing, number and value of shares of Class A common stock repurchased will be determined by a committee of the board of directors at its discretion and will depend on a number of factors, including the market price of the Class A common stock, capital allocation alternatives, general market and economic conditions and other corporate considerations. During fiscal 2024, we repurchased a total of 173,741 shares of Class A common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $10.0 million.
We have typically relied on cash available through credit facilities, in addition to cash from operations, to finance our working capital requirements and to support our growth. We regularly monitor potential capital sources, including equity and debt markets, in an effort to meet our planned capital expenditures and liquidity requirements. Our future success will depend on our ability to access outside sources of capital.
We believe that our operating cash flow and available borrowings under the Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement and the Term Loan B Credit Agreement (together, the “Credit Agreements”) will be sufficient to fund our operations and planned capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. However, future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including the potential impacts of inflation and supply chain constraints, and significant additional capital expenditures will be required to conduct our operations. Our operations and other capital resources may not provide sufficient cash to maintain planned or future levels of capital expenditures. In the event that we make one or more acquisitions and the amount of capital required is greater than the amount of cash on hand we have available for acquisitions at that time, we could be required to reduce the expected level of capital expenditures and/or seek additional capital. If we seek additional capital, we may do so through borrowings under the Credit Agreements, joint ventures, asset sales, offerings of debt or equity securities or other means. However, our ability to engage in any such transactions may be constrained by economic conditions and other factors outside of our control. Additional capital may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to obtain the funds we need, we may not be able to complete acquisitions that may be favorable to us or finance the capital expenditures necessary to conduct our operations.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of September 30, 2024, the Company had aggregate letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $8.3 million, future purchase commitments for diesel fuel and natural gas of $4.0 million and $0.5 million, respectively, and $2.2 million of minimum royalty payments related to mineral leases at aggregates facilities. Other than the letters of credit, future purchase commitments and minimum royalty payments, we do not currently have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. See Note 18 - Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. The results of our analysis form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, and the impact of such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements.
Critical accounting policies are those policies that, in management’s view, are the most important in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations. The notes to the consolidated financial statements also include disclosure of significant accounting policies. The methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements. These critical accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition are discussed further below.

Table of Contents
Revenue Recognition
The majority of our public construction contracts are fixed unit price contracts. Under fixed unit price contracts, we are committed to providing materials or services required by a contract at fixed unit prices (for example, dollars per ton of asphalt placed). Our private customer contracts are primarily fixed total price contracts, also known as lump sum contracts, which require that the total amount of work be performed for a single price. Revenues from fixed unit price and fixed total price construction contracts are recognized as performance obligations are satisfied over time (formerly known as the percentage-of-completion method), measured by the relationship of total cost incurred compared to total estimated contract costs (cost-to-cost input method). Under this method, revenues are recognized as costs are incurred in an amount equal to cost plus the related expected profit based on the ratio of costs incurred to estimated final costs. This cost-to-cost method is used because management considers it to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts. Contract costs consist of direct costs on contracts, including labor, materials, amounts payable to subcontractors and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as equipment costs, insurance and employee benefits. Contract cost is recorded as incurred, and revisions in contract revenues and cost estimates are reflected in the accounting period when known. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability, including those changes arising from contract change orders, penalty provisions and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined.
Change orders are modifications of an original contract that effectively change the existing provisions of the contract without adding new provisions or terms. Change orders may include changes in specifications or designs, manner of performance, facilities, equipment, materials, sites and period of completion of the work. Either we or our customers may initiate change orders. We consider unapproved change orders to be contract variations for which we have a change of scope for which we believe we are contractually entitled to a higher price, but where a price change associated with the scope change has not yet been agreed upon with the customer. Costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in the estimated cost to complete the contracts and are treated as project costs as incurred. We recognize revenues equal to costs incurred on unapproved change orders when realization of price approval is probable. Unapproved change orders involve the use of estimates, and it is reasonably possible that revisions to the estimated costs and recoverable amounts may be required in future reporting periods to reflect changes in estimates or final agreements with customers. Change orders that are unapproved as to both price and scope are evaluated as claims. We consider claims to be amounts in excess of agreed contract prices that we seek to collect from our customers or others for customer-caused delays, errors in specifications and designs, contract terminations, change orders that are either in dispute or are unapproved as to both scope and price, or other causes of unanticipated additional contract costs. Claims are included in the calculation of revenues when realization is probable and amounts can be reliably determined. To support these requirements, the existence of the following items must be satisfied: (i) the contract or other evidence provides a legal basis for the claim or a legal opinion has been obtained, stating that, under the circumstances, there is a reasonable basis to support the claim; (ii) additional costs are caused by circumstances that were unforeseen at the contract date and are not the result of deficiencies in our performance; (iii) costs associated with the claim are identifiable or otherwise determinable and are reasonable in view of the work performed; and (iv) the evidence supporting the claim is objective and verifiable, not based on management’s subjective evaluation of the situation or on unsupported representations. Revenues in excess of contract costs incurred on claims are recognized when an agreement is reached with the customer as to the value of the claim, which, in some instances, may not occur until after completion of work under the contract. Costs associated with claims are included in the estimated costs to complete the contracts and are treated as project costs when incurred.
For the majority of our contracts, we receive our final payment when projects are near completion or fully completed. The accuracy of our revenues and profit recognition in a given period depends on the accuracy of our estimates of the revenues and costs to finish uncompleted contracts. Our estimates for all of our significant contracts use a highly detailed “bottom up” approach. However, our projects can be highly complex and, in almost every case, the profit margin estimates for a contract will either increase or decrease to some extent from the amount that was originally estimated at the time of bid. Because we have a large number of projects of varying sizes and levels of complexity in process at any given time, these changes in estimates can sometimes offset each other without materially impacting our overall profitability. However, large changes in revenues or cost estimates can have a significant effect on profitability.
The accuracy of our revenue and profit recognition in a given period depends on the accuracy of our estimates of the cost to complete each project. Cost estimates for all of our projects use a detailed approach, and we believe our experience allows us to create materially reliable estimates. There are a number of factors that can contribute to changes in estimates of contract cost and profitability. The most significant of these include:
•
the completeness and accuracy of the original bid;
•
costs associated with scope changes;
•
changes in costs of labor and/or materials;
•
extended overhead and other costs due to owner, weather and other delays;
37
Table of Contents
•
subcontractor performance issues;
•
changes in productivity expectations;
•
site conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid;
•
changes from original design on design-build projects;
•
the availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of the project;
•
a change in the availability and proximity of equipment and materials;
•
our ability to fully and promptly recover on affirmative claims and back charges for additional contract costs; and
•
the customer’s ability to properly administer the contract.
The foregoing factors, as well as the stage of completion of contracts in process and the mix of contracts at different margins, may cause fluctuations in gross profit between periods, and these fluctuations may be significant.
Contracts Receivable, Including Retainage, Net
Contracts receivable are generally based on amounts billed to the customer and currently due in accordance with our contracts. Many of the contracts under which we perform work contain retainage provisions. Retainage refers to amounts earned by the Company but held by customers until contracts are near completion or fully completed. Retainage on active contracts is classified as a current asset regardless of the term of the contract and is generally collected within one year of the completion of a contract. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, contracts receivable included $52.7 million and $53.3 million, respectively, of retainage.
Because the majority of our construction contracts are entered into with federal, state or municipal government customers, credit risk is minimal. We confirm that funds have been appropriated by the government project owner prior to commencing work on such projects. While most of our public contracts are subject to termination at the election of the government entity, in the event of any such termination, we are entitled to receive the contract price for completed work and reimbursement of termination-related costs. Credit risk with private customers is minimized because of statutory mechanic’s liens, which give us high priority in the event of lien foreclosures following financial difficulties of private customers. We maintain an allowance for credit losses, which has historically been sufficient to cover accounts that are not collected.
Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill
Long-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment and acquired intangible assets, such as goodwill, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset, or an asset group, may not be recoverable. Impairment evaluations involve fair values and management estimates of useful asset lives and future cash flows. Actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by management, and this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position. For fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, there were no events or changes in circumstances that would indicate a material impairment of our long-lived assets.
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets must be tested for impairment at least annually. We performed our most recent annual impairment test on July 1, 2024. Our test indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. For our goodwill impairment test, we first evaluate our market capitalization compared to the net assets of the Company overall. Our final determination of valuation is impacted by a number of factors, but the key factors are the price of our common stock, recently completed transactions from both public companies and private transactions and our estimated forecast of future cash flows.
The valuation approaches contain uncertainty regarding the estimates used. Our market capitalization could be impacted because we are a controlled company, which impacts the control premium we apply to the market price of our common stock. One of the largest uncertainties relates to federal, state and local government spending, which management expects to continue to increase in the coming years. There are a number of other uncertainties with respect to our future financial performance that could impact estimated future cash flows, including those discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” elsewhere in this report. Based on our valuation approaches, we determined that our one reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, and thus concluded that the carrying value of goodwill was not impaired at July 1, 2024 or 2023. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had goodwill with a carrying amount of $231.7 million and $159.3 million, respectively.
For our indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test, we performed a qualitative impairment assessment. The qualitative assessment did not identify indicators of impairment, and it was determined that is more likely than not the indefinite-lived name license fair value was more than its carrying amount. Accordingly, no further analysis was required or performed.

Inventories
The Company’s inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and are accounted for on an average cost basis or a first-in, first-out cost basis. The cost of inventory includes the cost of material, labor, trucking and other equipment costs associated with procuring and transporting materials to HMA plants for production and delivery to customers. Inventories consist primarily of construction stone that has been removed from aggregates facilities and processed for future sale or internal use, raw materials including asphalt cement, and aggregates and millings that the Company expects to utilize on construction projects within one year. Inventories valued on the average cost basis totaled $95.8 million and $75.5 million at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Inventories valued on the first-in, first-out cost basis totaled $10.9 million and $8.5 million at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Income Taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and, where necessary, establish a valuation allowance. Valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets if we determine that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods.
To assess this likelihood, we use historical three-year results of operations, estimates and judgments regarding our future taxable income and consider the jurisdiction in which the taxable income is generated to determine whether a valuation allowance is required. Such evidence can include our current financial position, results of operations, actual and forecasted results, the reversal of deferred tax liabilities, tax planning strategies and the current and forecasted business economics of our industry. Additionally, we record uncertain tax positions at their net recognizable amount, based on the amount that management deems is more likely than not to be sustained upon ultimate settlement with the tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate.
On the basis of our evaluations, at September 30, 2024 and 2023, no valuation allowance was recorded on our net deferred tax assets, and we had no material uncertain tax positions. If our estimates or assumptions regarding our current and deferred tax items are inaccurate or are modified, these changes could have potentially material impacts on our earnings.
Accrued Insurance Cost
We carry insurance policies to cover various risks, primarily including general liability, automobile liability and workers’ compensation, under which we are liable to reimburse the insurance company for a portion of each claim paid. Since October 1, 2021, Construction Partners Risk Management, Inc., a captive insurance company and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, has retained the first $1,000,000 per claim liability for each claim paid. Also effective October 1, 2021, we became a member of a group captive insurance company that retains the next $550,000 per claim liability for each claim paid. We utilize various primary and excess insurance companies to cover the liability for claims in excess of the retained amounts. Changes in loss assumptions caused by changes in actual experience would affect the assessment of the ultimate liability and could have an effect on our operating results and financial position up to $1,000,000 per occurrence for general liability, automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims. Prior to October 1, 2021, the amount for which we were liable for general liability, automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims ranged from $100,000 to $500,000 per occurrence. Management accrues insurance costs for probable losses, both reported and unreported, that are reasonably estimable using actuarial methods based on historic trends modified, if necessary, by recent events. 
We provide employee medical insurance under policies that are both fixed-premium, fully-insured policies and self-insured policies that are administered by the insurance company. Under the self-insured policies, we are liable to reimburse the insurance company for actual claims paid plus an administrative fee. We purchase separate stop-loss insurance, which limits the individual participant claim loss to amounts ranging from $100,000 to $200,000.
Share-Based Payments and Other Equity Transactions
Our equity incentive plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of our board of directors. We account for awards issued under our equity incentive plan using a fair value-based method of accounting, whereby compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized over the service period, which is typically the vesting period. 
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of our short- and long-term debt obligations used to finance our operations and acquisitions. We have SOFR-based floating rate borrowings under the Credit Agreements, which expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in the reference interest rates. From time to time, we use derivative instruments as hedges against the impact of interest rate changes on future earnings and cash flows.  We do not enter into such derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes. 
39
Table of Contents
At September 30, 2024, we had a total of $515.0 million of variable rate borrowings outstanding. Holding other factors constant and absent the interest rate swap agreements described above, a hypothetical 1% change in our borrowing rates would result in a $5.2 million change in our annual interest expense based on our variable rate debt outstanding at September 30, 2024. The notional amount of the Company’s outstanding interest rate swap contract at September 30, 2024 was $300.0 million.  The maturity date of this swap is June 30, 2027, and the fair value of the outstanding swap contract was $11.6 million as of September 30, 2024. 
The following table presents the future principal payment obligations, interest payments, and fair values associated with the Company’s debt instruments assuming the Company’s actual level of variable rate debt as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands).

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Construction Partners, Inc. 
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Construction Partners, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013, and our report dated November 25, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee of the board of directors and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Revenue Recognition – Revenue Recognized Over Time Under Uncompleted Long-Term Construction Contracts 
As described in Note 6 to the financial statements, the Company has recognized $2,496,230,000 of costs and estimated earnings to date on uncompleted contracts at September 30, 2024. As described in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue derived from long-term construction contracts over time as the Company satisfies the single performance obligation for each construction contract. Progress towards completion of the performance obligation of each long-term construction project is estimated using the input method, which is measured by the relationship of total costs incurred through the measurement date to total estimated costs required to complete the project (cost-to-cost input method). Recognition of revenue under uncompleted long-term construction contracts requires significant judgment by management, including measuring progress towards completion of the contract by estimating total costs expected to be incurred to complete the performance obligation of a contract.
We have identified the revenue recognized under long-term construction contracts that were uncompleted at September 30, 2024 as a critical audit matter because of the significant assumptions management makes in determining the amount of revenue to recognize prior to completion of the performance obligation of a contract. Auditing management’s judgments related to measuring progress towards completion of the Company’s long-term construction contracts through estimating total costs expected to be incurred to complete the performance obligation of the long-term contracts involved a high degree of auditor judgment and increased audit effort. Our audit procedures related to revenue recognized under uncompleted long-term construction contracts included the following, among others:
42
Table of Contents
•
We obtained an understanding of the relevant controls related to revenue recognized under long-term construction contracts and tested such controls for design and implementation, as well as operating effectiveness, including management’s controls over the estimation of total contract costs to be incurred in order to complete the performance obligation of uncompleted contracts.
•
We selected a sample of long-term construction contracts, and we performed the following:
◦
Compared the current year costs incurred to prior year estimates of costs to complete, which involved comparing projects completed during the fiscal year with the estimates made as of the previous balance sheet date to evaluate management’s ability to accurately estimate costs to complete the performance obligation of its long-term construction contracts.
◦
Analyzed the estimated cost to complete and gross margins for uncompleted contracts by comparing the Company’s three-year historical average gross margins by customer type to the estimated margin for uncompleted contracts at September 30, 2024.
◦
Inquired with individuals outside of the accounting function, including project management teams and individuals responsible for oversight and satisfaction of the performance obligation, to obtain corroborating evidence regarding estimates of costs to complete and estimated gross margins on uncompleted contracts.
•
Compared the costs and estimated earnings during the month immediately subsequent to the fiscal year end to costs and estimated earnings to date on uncompleted contracts at September 30, 2024,and, on a sample basis, inquired with individuals responsible for oversight and satisfaction of the performance obligation in the contracts in order to obtain corroborating evidence regarding estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Construction Partners, Inc. 
Opinion on the Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Construction Partners, Inc., and its subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements, and our report dated November 25, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1 - 
General
Business Description
Construction Partners, Inc. (the “Company”) is a civil infrastructure company that specializes in the construction and maintenance of roadways across the Sunbelt in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. Through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the Company provides a variety of products and services to both public and private infrastructure projects, with an emphasis on highways, roads, bridges, airports and commercial and residential developments. The Company’s primary operations consist of (i) manufacturing and distributing hot mix asphalt (“HMA”) for both internal use and sales to third parties in connection with construction projects, (ii) paving activities, including the construction of roadway base layers and application of asphalt pavement, (iii) site development, including the installation of utility and drainage systems, (iv) mining aggregates, such as sand, gravel and construction stone, that are used as raw materials in the production of HMA and for sales to third parties, and (v) distributing liquid asphalt cement for both internal use and sales to third parties in connection with HMA production.
The Company was formed in 2007 by SunTx Capital Partners (“SunTx”), a private equity firm based in Dallas, Texas, as a holding company to facilitate an acquisition growth strategy in the HMA paving and construction industry. 
Management’s Estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts of assets, liabilities, stockholders’ equity, revenues and expenses during the reporting period, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Estimates are used in accounting for items such as recognition of revenues and cost of revenues, investments, mineral reserves, goodwill and other intangible assets, business acquisitions, valuation of operating lease right-of-use assets, allowance for credit losses, valuation allowances related to income taxes, accruals for potential liabilities related to lawsuits or insurance claims, asset retirement obligations, valuation of derivative instruments and valuation of equity-based compensation awards. Estimates are continually evaluated based on historical information and actual experience; however, actual results could differ from these estimates.

Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash consists principally of currency on hand and demand deposits at commercial banks. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid securities that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Cash equivalents include securities with original maturities of three months or less. The Company maintains demand accounts, money market accounts and certificates of deposit at several banks. From time to time, account balances have exceeded the maximum available federal deposit insurance coverage limit. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and regularly monitors its credit risk.
Restricted Cash
Construction Partners Risk Management, Inc. (the “Captive”), a captive insurance company and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, provides general liability, automobile liability and workers’ compensation insurance coverage to the Company and its subsidiaries. Restricted cash represents cash held in a fiduciary capacity by the Captive for the payment of casualty insurance claims.
 The Company had restricted cash of $
2.0
 million and $
0.8
 million at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Restricted Investments
The Company’s restricted investments consist of debt securities, which are held in a fiduciary capacity by the Captive for the payment of casualty insurance claims. The Company determines the classification of its securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates the determination at each balance sheet date. The Company has classified securities held by the Captive as available-for-sale. As a result, these securities are carried at their fair value. Purchases and sales of debt securities are recorded on the trade date. Interest income on debt securities is recorded when earned using an effective yield method. Unrealized gains and losses are reported as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net. These securities have been classified as non-current assets based on their respective maturity dates and the Company’s intent to reinvest sales proceeds into new restricted investments.
 The Company had restricted investments of $
18.0
 million and $
15.1
 million at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
The Company evaluates its available-for-sale debt securities quarterly to determine whether there has been a decline in the fair value below the amortized cost due to credit losses or other factors. This evaluation process entails judgement by the Company, and considers factors including the issuer’s financial condition and near-term prospects, future economic conditions, interest rate changes and changes in the rating of the security. When the Company has determined that it intends to sell, or that it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell a security before it recovers its amortized cost basis above fair value, the individual security is written down to fair value, with a corresponding charge to “Other income” within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. For available-for-sale debt securities that do not meet the intent impairment criteria but for which the Company has determined that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security is compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss allowance is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount by which the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis.
 For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had 
no
 intent impairments or credit losses.
Contracts Receivable Including Retainage, Net
Contracts receivable are generally based on amounts billed and currently due from customers, amounts currently due but unbilled, and amounts retained by customers. It is common in the Company’s industry for a small portion of either progress billings or the contract price, typically 10%, to be withheld by the customer until contracts are near completion or fully completed. Such amounts, defined as retainage, are included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as “Contracts receivable including retainage, net.” Based on the Company’s experience with similar contracts in recent years, billings for such retainage balances are generally collected within one year of the completion of the project.
Contracts receivable including retainage, net is stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances. Management provides for uncollectible accounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to the allowance for credit losses based on its assessment of the current status of individual accounts, type of service performed, current economic conditions, historical losses and other information available to management. Balances that are still outstanding after management has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the allowance for credit losses and an adjustment to the contract receivable.
Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities
Billing practices for the Company’s contracts are governed by the contract terms of each project based on (i) progress toward completion approved by the owner, (ii) achievement of milestones or (iii) pre-agreed schedules. Billings do not necessarily correlate with revenues recognized under the cost-to-cost input method. The Company records contract assets and contract liabilities to account for these differences in timing.
The contract asset, “Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts”, arises when the Company recognizes revenues for services performed under its construction projects, but the Company is not yet entitled to bill the customer under the terms of the contract. Amounts billed to customers are excluded from this asset and reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as “Contracts receivable including retainage, net.” Included in costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts are amounts the Company seeks or will seek to collect from customers or others for (i) errors, (ii) changes in contract specifications or design, (iii) contract change orders in dispute, unapproved as to scope and price, or (iv) other customer-related causes of unanticipated 
50
Table of Contents
additional contract costs (such as claims). Such amounts are recorded to the extent that the amount can be reasonably estimated and recovery is probable. Claims and unapproved change orders made by the Company may involve negotiation and, in rare cases, litigation. Unapproved change orders and claims also involve the use of estimates, and revenues associated with unapproved change orders and claims are included in the transaction price for which it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. The Company did not recognize any material amounts associated with claims and unapproved change orders during the periods presented.
The contract liability, “Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts”, represents the Company’s obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Company has been paid by the customer or for which the Company has billed the customer under the terms of the contract. Revenue for future services reflected in this account are recognized, and the liability is reduced, as the Company subsequently satisfies the performance obligation under the contract.
Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts are typically resolved within one year and are not considered significant financing components.

Concentration of Risks
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of contracts receivable including retainage. In the normal course of business, the Company provides credit to its customers and does not generally require collateral. The Company monitors concentrations of credit risk associated with these receivables on an ongoing basis. The Company has not historically experienced significant credit losses, due primarily to management’s assessment of customers’ credit ratings. The Company principally deals with recurring customers, state and local governments and well-known local companies whose reputations are known to management. The Company performs credit checks for significant new customers and generally requires progress payments for significant projects. The Company generally has the ability to file liens against the property if payments are not made on a timely basis.
 No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s contracts receivable including retainage, net balance at September 30, 2024 or September 30, 2023.
Projects performed for various departments of transportation accounted for

Inventories
The Company’s inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and are accounted for on an average cost basis or a first-in, first-out cost basis. The cost of inventory includes the cost of material, labor, trucking and other equipment costs associated with procuring and transporting materials to HMA plants for production and delivery to customers. Inventories consist primarily of construction stone that has been removed from aggregates facilities and processed for future sale or internal use, raw materials including asphalt cement, and aggregates and millings that the Company expects to utilize on construction projects within one year.
 Inventories valued on the average cost basis totaled $
95.8
 million and $
75.5
 million, respectively, at September 30, 2024 and 2023. Inventories valued on the first-in, first-out cost basis totaled $

 million and $
8.5
 million, respectively, at September 30, 2024 and 2023.
Revenues from Contracts with Customers
The Company derives a significant portion of revenues from contracts with its customers, predominantly by performing construction services for both public and private infrastructure projects, with an emphasis on highways, roads, bridges, airports and commercial and residential developments. These projects are performed for a mix of federal, state, municipal and private customers. In addition, the Company generates revenues from the sale of construction materials, including HMA, aggregates, liquid asphalt and ready-mix concrete, to third-party public and private customers pursuant to contracts with those customers. 
The following table reflects, for the periods presented, (i) revenues generated from public infrastructure construction projects and the sale of construction materials to public customers and (ii) revenues generated from private infrastructure construction projects and the sale of construction materials to private customers.

Revenues derived from construction projects are recognized over time as the Company satisfies its performance obligations by transferring control of the asset created or enhanced by the project to the customer. Recognition of revenues for construction projects requires significant judgment by management, including, among other things, estimating total costs expected to be incurred to complete a project and measuring progress toward completion. Management reviews contract estimates regularly to assess revisions of estimated costs to complete a project and for measurement of progress toward completion. No material adjustments to a contract were noted in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 or 2022.
Management believes the Company maintains reasonable estimates based on prior experience; however, many factors contribute to changes in estimates of contract costs. Accordingly, estimates made with respect to uncompleted projects are subject to change as each project progresses and better estimates of contract costs become available. All contract costs are recorded as incurred, and revisions to estimated total costs are reflected as soon as the obligation to perform is determined. Provisions are recognized for the full amount of estimated losses on uncompleted contracts whenever evidence indicates that the estimated total cost of a contract exceeds its estimated total revenue, regardless of the stage of completion. When the Company incurs additional costs related to work performed by subcontractors, the Company may be able to utilize contractual provisions to back charge the subcontractors for those costs. A reduction to costs related to back charges is recognized when estimated recovery is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Contract costs consist of (i) direct costs on contracts, including labor, materials, and amounts payable to subcontractors and (ii) indirect costs related to contract performance, such as insurance, employee benefits, and equipment (primarily depreciation, fuel, maintenance and repairs).
Progress toward completion is estimated using the input method, measured by the relationship of total cost incurred through the measurement date to total estimated costs required to complete the project (cost-to-cost method). The Company believes this method best depicts the transfer of goods and services to the customer because it represents satisfaction of the Company’s performance obligation under the contract, which occurs as the Company incurs costs. The Company measures percentage of completion based on the performance of a single performance obligation under its construction projects. Each of the Company’s construction contracts represents a single performance obligation to complete a defined construction project. This is because goods and services promised for delivery to a customer are not distinct, as the customer cannot benefit from any individual portion of the services on its own. All deliverables under a contract are part of a project defined by a customer and represent a series of integrated goods and services that have the same pattern of delivery to the customer and use the same measure of progress toward satisfaction of the performance obligation as the customer’s asset is created or enhanced by the Company. 
Revenue recognized during a reporting period is based on the cost-to-cost input method applied to the total transaction price, including adjustments for variable consideration, such as liquidated damages, penalties or bonuses, related to the timeliness or quality of project performance. The Company includes variable consideration in the estimated transaction price at the most likely amount to which the Company expects to be entitled or the most likely amount the Company expects to incur, in the case of liquidated damages or penalties.  Such amounts are included in the transaction price for which it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. The Company accounts for changes to the estimated transaction price using a cumulative catch-up adjustment.  
The majority of the Company’s public construction contracts are fixed unit price contracts. Under fixed unit price contracts, the Company commits to providing materials or services required by a contract at fixed unit prices (for example, dollars per ton of asphalt placed). The Company’s private customer contracts are primarily fixed total price contracts, also known as lump sum contracts, which require that the total amount of work be performed for a single price. Contract cost is recorded as incurred, and revisions in contract revenue and cost estimates are reflected in the accounting period when known. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability, including those changes arising from contract change orders, penalty provisions and final contract settlements, may result in revisions to estimated revenues and costs and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined.
Change orders are modifications of an original contract that effectively change the existing provisions of the contract and become part of the single performance obligation that is partially satisfied at the date of the contract modification. This is because goods and services promised under change orders are generally not distinct from the remaining goods and services under the existing contract, due to the significant integration of services performed in the context of the contract. Accordingly, change orders are generally accounted for as a modification of the existing contract and single performance obligation. The Company accounts for the modification using a cumulative catch-up adjustment. Either the Company or its customers may initiate change orders, which may include changes in specifications or designs, manner of performance, facilities, equipment, materials, sites and period of completion of the work.

Table of Contents
Revenues derived from the sale of HMA, aggregates, ready-mix concrete, and liquid asphalt are recognized at a point in time, which is when control of the product is transferred to the customer. Generally, that point in time is when the customer accepts delivery at its facility or receives product in its own transport vehicles from one of the Company’s HMA plants or aggregates facilities. Upon purchase, the Company generally provides an invoice or similar document detailing the goods transferred to the customer. The Company generally offers payment terms customary in the industry, which typically require payment ranging from point-of-sale to 30 days following purchase.
Fair Value Measurements 
The Company measures and discloses certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 820, 
Fair Value Measurements 
(“Topic 820”). Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Inputs used to measure fair value are classified using the following hierarchy:
Level 1.
 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.
Level 2.
 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through corroboration with observable market data.
Level 3.
 Inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability and include situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. The inputs used in the determination of fair value are based on the best information available under the circumstances and may require significant management judgment or estimation.
The Company endeavors to utilize the best available information in measuring fair value.
The Company’s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, contracts receivable including retainage, accounts payable and accrued expenses reflected as current assets and current liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2024 and 2023. Due to the short-term nature of these instruments, management considers their carrying value to approximate their fair value.
The Company also has debt securities reflected as restricted investments on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2024 and 2023. These investments are adjusted to fair value at each balance sheet date and are considered Level 2 fair value measurements.
As of September 30, 2024, the Company also had a Term Loan A and a Revolving Credit Facility, each as defined and described in Note 11 - Debt. The carrying value of amounts outstanding under these credit facilities is reflected as long-term debt, net of current maturities and deferred debt issuance costs and current maturities of long-term debt on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2024 and 2023. Due to the variable rate or short-term nature of these instruments, management considers their carrying value to approximate their fair value.
The Company also has derivative instruments. The fair value of commodity and interest rate swaps are based on forward and spot prices, as described in Note 20 - Fair Value Measurements.
Level 3 fair values are used to value acquired mineral reserves and leased mineral interests. The fair values of mineral reserves and leased mineral interests are determined using an excess earnings approach, which requires management to estimate future cash flows. The estimate of future cash flows is based on available historical information and forecasts determined by management, but is inherently uncertain. Key assumptions in estimating future cash flows include sales price, volumes and expected profit margins, net of capital requirements. The present value of the projected net cash flows represents the fair value assigned to mineral reserves and mineral interests. The discount rate is a significant assumption used in the valuation model and is based on the required rate of return that a hypothetical market participant would assume if purchasing the acquired business.
Management applies fair value measurement guidance to its impairment analysis for tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost or, if acquired in connection with a business combination, at fair value, and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements for operating leases are amortized over the lesser of the term of the related lease or the estimated useful lives of the improvements. Mineral reserves and mine development costs, including stripping costs incurred during the development stage of a mine, are depleted in accordance with the units-of-production method as aggregates are extracted, using the initial allocation of cost based on proven and probable reserves. Routine repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Asset improvements are capitalized at cost and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related asset.

Management periodically assesses the estimated useful life over which assets are depreciated, depleted or amortized. If the analysis warrants a change in the estimated useful life of property, plant and equipment, management will reduce the estimated useful life and depreciate, deplete or amortize the carrying value prospectively over the shorter remaining useful life.
The carrying amounts of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation are eliminated in the period of disposal, and the resulting gains and losses are included in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income during the same period.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The carrying value of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization is evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets, or an asset group, may not be recoverable. Events or circumstances that might cause management to perform impairment testing include, but are not limited to, (i) a significant decrease in the market price of an asset, (ii) a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or in its physical condition, (iii) an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset, (iv) an operating or cash flow performance combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset, and (v) an expectation that an asset will be disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. If indicators of potential impairment are present, management performs a recoverability test and, if necessary, records an impairment loss. If the total estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of an asset or asset group is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, measured as the amount required to reduce the carrying value to fair value. Fair value is determined in accordance with the best available information based on the hierarchy described under “Fair Value Measurements” above. For example, the Company would first seek to identify quoted prices or other observable market data. If observable data is not available, management would apply the best available information under the circumstances to a technique, such as a discounted cash flow model, to estimate fair value. Impairment analysis involves estimates and the use of assumptions in connection with judgments made in forecasting long-term estimated inflows and outflows resulting from the use and ultimate disposition of an asset, and determining the ultimate useful lives of assets. Actual results may differ from these estimates using different assumptions, which could materially impact the results of an impairment assessment.
Segment Reporting and Reporting Units
As of September 30, 2024, the Company operated in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee through its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Each of the Company’s platform operating companies engages in essentially the same business, which consists primarily of infrastructure and road construction.
Management has determined that the Company functions as a single operating segment, and thus reports as a single reportable segment. This determination is based on rules prescribed by GAAP applied to the manner in which management operates the Company. In particular, management assessed the discrete financial information routinely reviewed by the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), its Chief Executive Officer, to monitor the Company’s operating performance and support decisions regarding allocation of resources to its operations. Specifically, performance is continuously monitored at the consolidated level and as necessary at the individual contract level to timely identify deviations from expected results. Resource allocations are based on the capacity of the Company’s operating facilities to pursue new project opportunities, including reallocation of assets that are underutilized from time to time at a certain operating facility to another operating facility where additional resources might be required to fully meet demand. Other factors further supporting this conclusion include substantial similarities throughout all of the Company’s operations with respect to services provided, type of customers, sourcing of materials and manufacturing and delivery methodologies.
Management further determined that, based on their economic similarities, the Company’s operating subsidiaries, representing components, should be aggregated into one reporting unit for purposes of assessing potential impairment of goodwill in accordance with ASC Topic 350, 
Intangibles — Goodwill and Other
. These legal entities represent acquisitions that occurred over time pursuant to the Company’s strategic growth strategy. Each operating subsidiary is managed by its president, who has primary responsibility for the 
54
Table of Contents
respective operating subsidiary. These presidents are directly accountable to the CODM and maintain regular contact with the CODM as a team to discuss operating activities, financial results, forecasts, and operating plans for the Company’s single operating segment.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations. Other intangible assets consist of an indefinite-lived trade name license in connection with a business acquired, and finite-lived assets, including a non-compete agreement, customer relationships and construction backlog, each acquired in business acquisitions. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least annually, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In addition, management evaluates whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. Judgments regarding indicators of potential impairment are based on market conditions and operational performance of the business.
Annually, on the first day of the Company’s fourth fiscal quarter, management performs an analysis of the carrying value of goodwill at its reporting unit for potential impairment. In accordance with GAAP, the Company may assess its goodwill for impairment initially using a qualitative approach to determine whether conditions exist to indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If management concludes, based on its assessment of relevant events, facts and circumstances, that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s carrying value is greater than its fair value, then a quantitative analysis will be performed to determine whether there is any impairment. The Company may also elect to initially perform a quantitative analysis instead of starting with a qualitative assessment. Because the Company has only 
one
 reporting unit, a market capitalization calculation can be performed as the first step of the quantitative assessment by comparing the book value of the Company’s stock (determined by reference to the Company’s stockholders’ equity) to the fair value of a share of the Company’s stock.  If the fair value of the stock is greater than the book value of the stock, goodwill is deemed not to be impaired, and no further testing is required. If the fair value is less than the book value, then the Company must take a second step to determine the impairment amount, as described below.  
The second step requires comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, to its fair value, typically using the multiple period discounting method under the income approach and market approach. The income approach uses a discounted cash flow model, which involves significant estimates and assumptions, including preparation of revenues and profitability growth forecasts, selection of a discount rate, and selection of a terminal year multiple, to estimate fair value. The market approach could include applying a control premium to the market price of the Company’s common stock or utilizing guideline public company multiples. Management’s assessment of facts and circumstances at each analysis date could cause these assumptions to change. If the fair value of the respective reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered to be impaired, and no further testing is required. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to write down goodwill in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. 
The Company performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill using the market capitalization calculation for fiscal years 2024 and 2023 and determined that the fair value of its reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, and thus concluded that the carrying value of goodwill was not impaired as of each goodwill impairment test date, which is July 1 of the applicable year. Accordingly, no further analysis was required or performed.
Management also annually assesses the carrying value of the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill on the first day of the fiscal fourth quarter. The Company performed a qualitative impairment assessment of its indefinite-lived trade name licenses. The qualitative assessment did not identify indicators of impairment, and it was determined that more likely than not the indefinite-lived trade name license fair value was more than its carrying amount. Accordingly, no further analysis was required or performed.
Deferred Financing Costs
Costs directly associated with obtaining debt financing are capitalized upon the issuance of long-term debt and amortized over the term of the related debt agreement. Unamortized amounts are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related long-term debt liability. Loan issuance costs associated with the Revolving Credit Facility are presented as a component of other assets. Loan issuance costs incurred in connection with the Revolving Credit Facility are amortized using the straight-line method over the term of the Revolving Credit Facility.

Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes includes federal and state income taxes. Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying values and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the fiscal years in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the 
55
Table of Contents
period that includes the enactment date. Management evaluates the realization of deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are presented on a net basis by taxing authority and classified as non-current on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
The Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of the Company’s tax positions that are at least more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, management accrues the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not to be sustained. The Company classifies income tax-related interest and penalties as interest expense and other expenses, respectively. Refer to Note 15 - Provision for Income Taxes for further information regarding the Company’s federal and state income taxes.
Equity-Based Incentive Plans
Compensation costs related to equity-classified share-based awards are recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on grant date fair value. Compensation cost for graded-vesting awards is recognized ratably over the respective vesting periods.
Accrued Insurance Costs
The Company carries insurance policies to cover various risks, primarily including general liability, automobile liability and workers’ compensation, under which it is liable to reimburse the insurance company for a portion of each claim paid. Since October 1, 2021, the Captive has retained liability for the first $
1,000,000
 of each claim paid. Also since October 1, 2021, the Company has been a member of CIRCA, Limited, a group captive insurance company, that retains the next $
550,000
 per claim liability for each claim paid. The Company utilizes various primary and excess insurance companies to cover the liability for claims in excess of the retained amounts. Changes in loss assumptions caused by changes in actual experience would affect the assessment of the ultimate liability and could have an effect on the Company’s operating results and financial position. Management accrues insurance costs for probable losses, both reported and unreported, that are reasonably estimable using actuarial methods based on historical trends modified, if necessary, by recent events. 
The Company provides employee medical insurance under policies that are both fixed-premium, fully-insured policies and self-insured policies that are administered by the insurance company. Under the self-insured policies, the Company is liable to reimburse the insurance company for actual claims paid plus an administrative fee. The Company purchases separate stop-loss insurance that limits the individual participant claim loss to amounts ranging from $
100,000
 to $
200,000
.
In addition to the retention items noted above, the Company’s insurance provider requires the Company to maintain a standby letter of credit. This letter of credit serves as a guarantee to pay the Company’s insurance provider the incurred claim costs attributable to general liability, workers’ compensation and automobile liability claims, up to the amount stated in the standby letter of credit, in the event that these claims are not paid by the Company
 (see Note 18 - Commitments and Contingencies).
Warranties
For some contracts, the Company is required to furnish a warranty that is usually one year in length. Because of the nature of these contracts, including contract owner inspections of the work both during construction and prior to acceptance, the Company has not experienced significant warranty costs for these short-term warranties and, therefore, has not established an accrual of these costs. Certain contracts carry longer warranty periods, for which the Company has accrued an estimate of warranty costs. The warranty liability is estimated based on the Company’s experience with the specific type of construction work and was not significant as of September 30, 2024 or 2023.
Earnings per Share
Basic net income per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per common share attributable to common stockholders is the same as basic net income per share attributable to common stockholders, but includes dilutive unvested stock awards using the treasury stock method.
Stripping Costs
Stripping costs are costs incurred for the removal of overburden or waste materials for the purpose of obtaining access to aggregate materials that will be commercially produced. 
56
Table of Contents
Stripping costs incurred during the development stage of a mine (pre-production stripping) are capitalized and reported within property, plant and equipment, net in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Capitalized pre-production stripping costs are depleted in accordance with the units-of-production method as aggregates are extracted, once the mine is no longer in the development stage. Pre-production stripping costs included in property, plant and equipment were $
1.7
 million and $
0.8
 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2024 and 2023.
Stripping costs incurred during the production phase of a mine are variable production costs and are included in the costs of the inventory produced during the period that the stripping costs are incurred. The production phase of a mine is deemed to begin when saleable minerals are extracted, regardless of the level of production. However, the production phase does not commence with the removal of de minimis saleable mineral material that occurs in conjunction with the removal of overburden or waste material for the purpose of obtaining access to aggregate materials.
 Stripping costs considered as production costs and included in the costs of inventory produced for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $
3.2
 million, $
3.1
 million and $
1.7
 million, respectively.
Asset Retirement Obligations
Asset retirement obligations (“AROs”) are legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets resulting from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the underlying assets. The ARO is recognized at its estimated fair value in the period in which it is incurred. These obligations generally include the estimated net future costs of dismantling, restoring and reclaiming operating mines and related mine sites, in accordance with federal, state, local regulatory and land lease agreement requirements. Upon initial recognition of a liability, the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the related asset. The liability is accreted over time through charges to earnings. Reclamation costs are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated present value resulting from the passage of time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation and abandonment costs. If the ARO is settled for an amount other than the carrying amount of the liability, the Company recognizes a gain or loss on settlement. The Company reviews, on an annual basis, unless otherwise deemed necessary, the asset retirement obligation at each mine site in accordance with ASC guidance for accounting for reclamation obligations. 
To determine the fair value of the AROs, the Company estimates the cost for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation activities including a reasonable profit margin. This cost is then increased for future estimated inflation based on the estimated years to complete and discounted to fair value using present value techniques with a credit-adjusted, risk-free rate.
 See Note 23 - Asset Retirement Obligations.
Right of Use Assets and Lease Liabilities
At the inception of a contractual arrangement, the Company determines whether a contract contains a lease by assessing whether the contract conveys to the Company the right to control the use of an identified asset in exchange for consideration over a period of time. Leases are recognized in accordance with ASC Topic 842, 
Leases
 (“Topic 842”).
The Company measures and records an operating lease liability equal to the present value of the future lease payments. Because most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company’s incremental borrowing rate is used in determining the present value of lease payments. The amount of the operating lease right-of-use asset consists of: (i) the amount of the initial measurement of the operating lease liability; (ii) any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, minus any lease incentives received, and (iii) any initial direct costs incurred. The present value calculation may account for an option to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. Within the provisions of certain leases, there are escalations in payments over the base lease term, which have been reflected in lease expense on a straight-line basis for operating leases over the expected lease term. A portion of the Company’s lease contracts contain the option to extend or renew. The Company assesses these options for individual leases in determining the initial measurement of the operating lease liability.
The Company has elected not to apply the recognition requirements of Topic 842 to short-term leases (those with terms of 12 months or less) or leases to explore for or use minerals. Instead, for these types of leases, the Company recognizes lease expense in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Comprehensive Income
The Company reports comprehensive income in its Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity. Comprehensive income consists of two subsets: net income and other comprehensive income (“OCI”). OCI includes adjustments for changes in fair value of an interest rate swap contract derivative and available-for-sale restricted investments. For additional information about comprehensive income, see Note 22 - Other Comprehensive Income (Loss).
57
Table of Contents
Business Acquisitions
The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC Topic 805, 
Business Combinations 
(“Topic 805”), which allocates the fair value of the purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values, other than leases acquired in connection with business combinations, which are recorded based on Topic 842, and contract assets and liabilities acquired in connection with business combinations, which are recorded based on ASC Topic 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
. The excess of the purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. 
Determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The Company engages third-party appraisal firms when appropriate to assist in the fair value determination of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Acquisition-related expenses and transaction costs associated with business combinations are expensed as incurred.
The Company may adjust the amounts recognized in an acquisition during a measurement period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition. Any such adjustments are the result of subsequently obtaining additional information that existed at the acquisition date regarding the assets acquired or the liabilities assumed. Measurement period adjustments are generally recorded as increases or decreases to goodwill, if any, recognized in the transaction. The cumulative impact of measurement period adjustments on depreciation, amortization and other income statement items are recognized in the period the adjustment is determined.
Note 3 - 
Accounting Standards
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
The Company monitors all Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) and other authoritative guidance. There are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that are expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.
Accounting Standards Pending Adoption
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, “Segment Reporting - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures,” which requires enhanced disclosures related to significant segment expenses and a description of how the chief operating decision maker utilizes segment operating profit or loss to assess segment performance. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and is to be applied retrospectively. The Company does not expect ASU 2023-07 to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements and disclosures.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures,” which requires disclosure of specific categories and disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation table and expands disclosures related to income taxes paid. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 and is to be applied prospectively. The Company does not expect ASU 2023-09 to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements and disclosures.

Combined Acquisitions During the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2024
The above-referenced acquisitions were accounted for as business combinations in accordance with Topic 805. The Company consulted with independent third parties to assist in the valuation process. Total consideration transferred for these 
eight
 acquisitions was $
231.7
 million as of September 30, 2024.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values based on the methodologies described under Business Acquisitions in Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies. The amount of the purchase price exceeding the net fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recorded as goodwill in the aggregate amount of $
71.0
 million for these 
eight
 acquisitions, which is deductible for income tax purposes. Goodwill primarily represents the assembled workforce and synergies expected to result from the acquisitions.
The results of operations attributable to these acquisitions are included in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, from their respective acquisition dates forward. The Company records certain costs to effect acquisitions as they are incurred, which are reflected in general and administrative expenses on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income in the amounts of $
1.5
 million, $
0.3
 million, and $
0.8
 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
There are certain acquisitions with provisional estimates that are subject to finalization due to the recent timing of the acquisitions, status of valuations and finalization of working-capital agreements. These estimates are subject to revision, which may result in adjustments to the values presented below. The Company will finalize these amounts within 
12
 months from the respective acquisition dates.

As work is performed, revenue is recognized and the corresponding liability balance of billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts is reduced. During the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized revenue of $
78.9
 million, $
52.5
 million and $
33.7
 million, respectively, that was included in the billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts liability balance at September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
At September 30, 2024, the Company had unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligations under construction project contracts representing approximately $
1.48
 billion in aggregate transaction price. The Company expects to earn revenue as it satisfies the performance obligations under those contracts in the amount of approximately $
1.18
 billion during the fiscal year ending September 30, 2025, and approximately $
0.30
 billion thereafter.

Table of Contents
All outstanding advances under the Term Loan A and Revolving Credit Facility are due and payable in full on June 30, 2027 (the “Maturity Date”). The Initial Term Loan A (commencing on September 30, 2022) and the Incremental Term Loan A (commencing on May 29, 2024) amortize in quarterly installments in an amount (subject, in each case, to adjustments for prior mandatory and voluntary prepayments of principal) equal to: (a) 
1.25
% of the original principal amount on each of the following 11 quarter-end payment dates; (b) 
1.875
% of the original principal amount on each of the next eight quarter-end payment dates; and (c) all remaining principal on the Maturity Date. The annual interest rates applicable to advances are calculated, at the Company’s option, by using either a base rate, Term SOFR plus 
0.10
% or (solely with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility) Daily Simple SOFR plus 
0.10
%, in each case, plus an applicable margin percentage that corresponds to the Company’s consolidated net leverage ratio. Subject to various requirements, the Company generally may (and, under certain circumstances, must), prepay all or a portion of the outstanding balance of the advances, together with accrued interest thereon, prior to their contractual maturity. The obligations of the Company and its subsidiaries under the Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Company and each of its subsidiaries.
At September 30, 2024 and 2023, there was $
392.2
 million and $
283.8
 million, respectively, of principal outstanding under the Term Loan A, $
122.9
 million and $
93.1
 million, respectively, of principal outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, and availability of $
268.8
 million and $
222.1
 million, respectively, under the Revolving Credit Facility, including a reduction for outstanding letters of credit. 
The Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement contains customary negative covenants for agreements of this type, including, but not limited to, restrictions on the Company’s ability to make acquisitions, make loans or advances, make capital expenditures and investments, pay dividends, create or incur indebtedness, create liens, wind up or dissolve, consolidate, merge or liquidate, or sell, transfer or dispose of assets. The Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement also requires the Company to satisfy certain financial covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 
1.20
-to-1.00 and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 
3.50
-to-1.00, subject to certain adjustments. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s fixed charge coverage ratio was 
3.15
-to-1.00 and 
2.56
-to-1.00, respectively, and the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio was 
1.81
-to-1.00 and 
1.72
-to-1.00, respectively. At both September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement.
From time to time, the Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge against the risk of changes in interest rates. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, the aggregate notional value of these interest rate swap agreements was $
300.0
 million and the fair value was $

Note 12 - 
Equity
Shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting rights, conversion rights and transfer restrictions applicable to shares of Class B common stock. The holders of Class A common stock are entitled to 
one
 vote per share, and the holders of Class B common stock are entitled to 
ten
 votes per share. The holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, including the election of directors, unless otherwise required by applicable law or the Company’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws. Shares of Class B common stock are convertible into shares of Class A common stock at any time at the option of the holder or upon any transfer, subject to certain limited exceptions. In addition, upon the election of the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Class B common stock, all outstanding shares of Class B common stock will be converted into shares of Class A common stock. Once converted into shares of Class A common stock, shares of Class B common stock will not be reissued. Class A common stock is not convertible into any other class of the Company’s capital stock.

The stock repurchase program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any shares of Class A common stock, and the stock repurchase program may be modified, suspended, extended or terminated at any time by the Company’s Board of Directors. The actual timing, number and value of shares of Class A common stock repurchased will be determined by a committee of the Board of Directors at its discretion and will depend on a number of factors, including the market price of the Company’s Class A common stock, capital allocation alternatives, general market and economic conditions and other corporate considerations.

173,741
 shares of Class A common stock for aggregate consideration of approximately $
10.0

Note 13 - 
Earnings Per Share
As discussed in Note 12 - Equity, the Company has Class A common stock and Class B common stock.

Performance Stock Units - Equity Classified Awards
Performance stock units (“PSUs”) provide for the issuance of shares of Class A common stock upon vesting, which occurs at the end of the performance period based on achievement of certain Company performance metrics established by the Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors. The final number of shares of common stock issuable upon vesting of PSUs can range from 
0
% to 
150
% of the number of PSUs initially granted, depending on the level of achievement, as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors. The achievement of performance goals is modified by the total stockholder return ranking of the Company against the Russell 2000 Index over the performance period and can increase or decrease the achieved award by up to 
15
%. The Company recognizes expense, net of estimated forfeitures, for PSUs based on the forecasted achievement of Company performance metrics, multiplied by the fair value of the total number of shares of common stock that the Company anticipates will be issued based on such achievement. 
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, the Company awarded PSUs representing a target of 
113,044
 shares and forecasted vesting of 
84,783
 shares of Class A common stock to certain members of Company management under the Equity Incentive Plan.  The grants are classified as equity awards. The aggregate grant date fair value of these PSU awards was $
5.5
 million. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded compensation expense in connection with PSUs in the amount of $
2.3
 million and $
2.0
 million, respectively, which is reflected as general and administrative expenses in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. At September 30, 2024, the Company forecasted 
149,807
 shares of Class A common stock underlying PSUs as unvested and approximately $
3.9
 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to PSU awards, which will be recognized over a remaining weighted-average period of 
2.1
 years. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, 
55,358
 shares of Class A common stock underlying PSUs were vested and issued.

four
 equal annual installments beginning on the date of the first fiscal year-end after the grant date.

The Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2024 and 2023 include gross deferred tax assets of $
26.3
 million and $
10.9
 million, respectively. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities (including the impact of available carryforward periods), projected taxable income, and tax-planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the weight of all evidence known and available as of the balance sheet date, management believes that these tax benefits are more likely than not to be realized in the future. To the extent that management does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established.
Income taxes payable have been reduced by fuel tax credits of $
0.5
 million and $
0.3
 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The remaining amount of goodwill expected to be deductible for tax purposes was $
164.9
 million and $
109.5
 million at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Uncertain Tax Positions
ASC Topic 740,
 Income Taxes 
(“Topic 740”), prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement model for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in a tax return and provides guidance on derecognition classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.
The Company is subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions in the United States. Tax audits, by their nature, are often complex. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of the calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, management determines whether the benefits of the Company’s tax positions are at least more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, management accrues the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not to be sustained. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. The Company performed an analysis of its tax positions and determined that no uncertain tax positions existed at September 30, 2024 or 2023. Accordingly, there was no liability for uncertain tax positions at September 30, 2024 or 2023. Based on the provisions of Topic 740, the Company had 
no
 material unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2024 or 2023. Due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards, the Company’s federal income tax returns for fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 through 2023 are subject to examination. Various state income tax returns for fiscal years ended September 30, 2012 through 2023 are also subject to examination.
Note 16 - 
Employee Benefit Plans
The Company offers a 401(k) retirement plan covering substantially all employees who are at least 
18
 years old and have more than 
six months
 of service. The Company makes discretionary employer contributions, subject to IRS safe harbor rules. Employer contributions charged to earnings during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $
7.8
 million, $
6.8
 million, and $
5.5
 million, respectively.
Note 17 - 
Related Parties
On December 31, 2017, the Company sold an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary to an immediate family member of an executive officer of the Company (“Purchaser of Subsidiary”) in consideration for a note receivable in the amount of $
1.0
 million, which approximated the net book value of the disposed entity. At September 30, 2024, $
0.1
 million and $
0.1
 million was reflected on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets within other current assets and other assets, respectively, representing the remaining balances on this note receivable. In connection with this transaction, the Company also received a note from the disposed entity (“Disposed Entity”) on December 31, 2017 in the amount of $
1.0
 million representing certain accounts payable of the disposed entity that were paid by the Company. At September 30, 2024, $
0.1
 million and $
0.1
 million was reflected on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets within other current assets and other assets, respectively, representing the remaining balances on this note receivable. Remaining principal and interest payments are scheduled to be made in periodic installments through fiscal year 2026.
Prior to its acquisition by the Company, a current subsidiary of the Company advanced funds to an entity owned by an immediate family member of an officer of the Company in connection with a land development project. The obligations of the borrower entity to repay the advances were guaranteed by a separate entity owned by the same family member of the officer. Amounts outstanding under the advances did not bear interest and matured in full in March 2021. In March 2021, the subsidiary of the Company amended and restated the terms of the repayment obligation, as a result of which the officer personally assumed the remaining balance of the obligation. No new amounts were advanced to the officer by the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof in connection with the transaction. Under the amended and restated terms, the officer executed a promissory note in favor of the Company’s subsidiary in the principal amount of $
0.8
 million. The note bears simple interest at a rate of 
4.0
% and requires annual minimum payments of $
0.1
 million inclusive of principal and accrued interest, with any remaining principal and accrued interest due and payable in full on December 31, 2027. Amounts outstanding under the note are reflected on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets within other current assets and other assets (“Land Development Project”).

Note 18 - 
Commitments and Contingencies
From time to time, the Company is subject to inquiries or audits by taxing authorities arising from its operations, covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of business, such as income taxes and other types of taxes. Each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters may not be resolved in the Company’s favor. The Company is also involved in other legal and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The outcomes of these inquiries and legal proceedings are not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations on an individual basis, and management did not accrue any material loss contingencies for the periods presented. However, adverse outcomes in a significant number of such ordinary course inquiries and legal proceedings could, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.
Letters of Credit
Under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company has a total capacity of $
400.0
 million that may be used for a combination of cash borrowings and letter of credit issuances. At each of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had aggregate letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $
8.3
 million and $
9.8
 million, respectively, primarily related to certain insurance policies as described in Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies.
Purchase Commitments
As of September 30, 2024, the Company had unconditional purchase commitments for diesel fuel and natural gas in the normal course of business in the aggregate amount of $
4.0
 million and $
0.5
 million, respectively. Management does not expect any significant changes in the market value of these goods during the commitment period that would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company.

Short-term leases (those with terms of 12 months or less) are not capitalized but are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The majority of the Company’s short-term leases relate to equipment used on construction projects. These leases are entered into at periodic rental rates for an unspecified duration and typically have a termination for convenience provision.
As of September 30, 2024, the weighted-average remaining term of the Company’s operating leases was 
5.0
 years, and the weighted-average discount rate was 
5.62
%. As of September 30, 2024, the lease liability was equal to the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the incremental borrowing rate on the Company’s secured debt using a single maturity discount rate, as such rate is not materially different from the discount rate applied to each of the leases in the portfolio.

The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is based on a model-driven valuation using the observable components (e.g., interest rates), which are observable at commonly quoted intervals for the full term of the contracts. The fair value of the Company’s commodity swap contracts is based on an analysis of the expected cash flow of the contract in combination with observable forward price inputs obtained from a third-party pricing source. The calculations are adjusted for credit risk. Therefore, the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Derivative assets are included within “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” and “Other assets” on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Derivative liabilities are 
77
Table of Contents
included within “Accrued expense and other current liabilities” and “Other long-term liabilities” on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Debt securities primarily consist of corporate bonds and U.S. Government and agency obligations. The fair value of these investments is determined based on market quotes. These investments are included within “Restricted Investments” on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Note 21 - 
Investment in Derivative Instruments
Interest Rate Swap Contracts
The Company uses derivative instruments as part of its overall strategy to manage its exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates. The Company regularly monitors the financial stability and credit standing of the counterparties to its derivative instruments. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The Company records derivatives at fair value. On the date the derivative contract is entered into, the Company may designate the derivative as one of the following: (i) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be paid (“cash flow hedge”)  or (ii) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability (“fair value hedge”).
Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is qualified and designated as a cash flow hedge or net investment hedge are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income until they are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. 
Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is qualified and designated as a fair value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in current period earnings. 
If the Company does not specifically designate a derivative as one of the above, changes in the fair value of the undesignated derivative instrument are reported in current period earnings. Cash flows from designated derivative financial instruments are classified within the same category as the item being hedged in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, while cash flows from undesignated derivative financial instruments are included as an investing activity.
If the Company determines that it qualifies for and will designate a derivative as a hedging instrument, the Company formally documents all relationships between hedging activities, including the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes matching all derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges to specific forecasted transactions and linking all derivatives designated as fair value hedges to specific assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Company performs an initial prospective assessment of hedge effectiveness on a quantitative basis between the inception date and the earlier of the first quarterly hedge effectiveness date or the issuance of the financial statements that include the hedged transaction. On a quarterly basis, the Company assesses the effectiveness of designated hedges in offsetting the variability in the cash flows or fair values of the hedged assets or obligations using a qualitative assessment. The Company would discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when the derivative is no longer highly effective as a hedge, the underlying hedged transaction is no longer probable or the hedging instrument expires, is sold, terminated or exercised.
Commodity Swap Contracts
The Company’s operations expose it to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in commodity prices. As part of its risk management process, the Company began entering into commodity swap transactions through regulated commodity exchanges. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Changes in fair value of commodity swaps are recognized in earnings.
The following table represents the approximate amount of realized and unrealized gains (losses) and changes in fair value recognized in earnings on commodity derivative contracts for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022 and the fair value of these derivatives as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

Subsequent Events
Acquisition of Lone Star Paving
On November 1, 2024, the Company acquired all of the outstanding membership units of Asphalt Inc., LLC (doing business as Lone Star Paving) (“Lone Star Paving” and such acquisition, the “Lone Star Acquisition”), a vertically integrated asphalt manufacturing and paving company headquartered in Austin, Texas, with 
10
 HMA plants, 
four
 aggregate facilities, and 
one
 liquid asphalt terminal supporting its operations. The aggregate consideration delivered at the closing of the Lone Star Acquisition consisted of (i) $
654.2
 million in cash (as adjusted pursuant to the Unit Purchase Agreement, dated as of October 20, 2024, by and among the Company, Lone Star Paving, the selling unit holders party thereto, and John J. Wheeler, in his capacity as the selling unit holders’ representative thereunder) and (ii) 
3,000,000
 shares of Class A common stock having an aggregate fair market value of approximately $
238.9
 million at closing. In addition, the Company agreed to (i) pay cash to the selling unit holders in an amount equal to the working capital remaining in Lone Star Paving at closing, as finally determined (subject to adjustments and offsets to satisfy certain indemnification obligations and any purchase price overpayments), to be paid out in quarterly installments over 
four
 quarters following the closing and (ii) purchase from the selling unit holders for $
30.0
 million in cash an entity that owns certain real property following receipt of specified operational entitlements by such entity. The cash paid at closing was funded from the proceeds of the Term Loan B (defined below).  The transaction will be accounted for as a business combination in accordance with Topic 805. 
In connection with the acquisition, the Company issued awards under the Equity Incentive Plan to certain key employees of Lone Star Paving consisting of 
180,000
 shares of restricted Class A common stock having an aggregate grant date fair value of approximately $
14.2
 million. Separately, the Company paid transaction bonuses to certain officers, directors, key contractors and employees of the Company consisting of approximately $
2.7
 million in cash, 
85,000
 restricted shares of Class A common stockissued under the Equity Incentive Plan having an aggregate grant date fair value of approximately $
6.3
 million, and 
55,000
 restricted shares of Class B common stock issued under the Restricted Stock Plan having an aggregate grant date fair value of approximately $
4.1
 million. The restricted shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vested in full on November 6, 2024.    
Term Loan B Credit Agreement
On November 1, 2024, the Company entered into a Term Loan Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, BofA Securities, Inc., PNC Capital Markets LLC, Regions Capital Markets, a division of Regions Bank, and TD Securities (USA) LLC, each as joint lead arranger and joint bookrunner, and certain other lenders party thereto (the “Term Loan B Credit Agreement”). The Term Loan B Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured first lien term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $
850.0
 million, which amount was fully drawn on November 1, 2024 (the “Term Loan B”). A portion of the proceeds of the Term Loan B was used to finance the cash portion of the consideration for the Lone Star Paving acquisition, including the repayment of certain outstanding indebtedness of Lone Star Paving and its subsidiaries at the closing. The remaining loan proceeds were or will be used (i) to repay the Company’s outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility provided by the Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement, (ii) to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the foregoing debt financing transactions and the Lone Star Acquisition and (iii) for working capital and other corporate purposes as permitted by the Term Loan B Credit Agreement.
The term loan matures on November 1, 2031 (the “Term Loan B Maturity Date”), and all outstanding principal amounts and accrued and unpaid interest thereon shall be due and payable on such date. The Company must repay the term loan in equal quarterly installments, commencing with the first full fiscal quarter ending after the date of the Term Loan B Credit Agreement, in an aggregate principal amount equal to 
0.25
% of the principal amount of the term loan, subject to adjustment for, among other things, any incremental term loans, with the balance payable on the Term Loan B Maturity Date.
Borrowings under the Term Loan B Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company’s option, at a rate per annum equal to (i) a forward-looking term rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate for the applicable interest period (“Term SOFR”) plus an applicable margin (the “Term SOFR Loans”) or (ii) the Base Rate (as defined below) plus the applicable margin (the “Base Rate Loans”). The Base Rate means, for any day, a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (w) the federal funds rate plus 
0.50
%, (x) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by Bank of America as its “prime rate”, (y) Term SOFR plus 
1.00
% and (z) 
1.00
%. The applicable margin is (A) 
2.50
% in the case of Term SOFR Loans and (B) 
1.50
% in the case of Base Rate Loans. With respect to any Term SOFR Loans, the Company is required to pay interest on the last day of each one-, three- or six-month interest period, as elected by the Company, and, if such interest period is longer than three months, also at the end of each three-month period during such interest period. With respect to any Base Rate Loans, the Company is required to pay interest quarterly in arrears. 
Amendment to Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement
On October 30, 2024, the Company entered into a Fourth Amendment to the Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement to, among other things, permit (i) the Lone Star Acquisition, (ii) entry into the Term Loan B Credit Agreement, and (iii) certain liens to be granted to secure the indebtedness incurred under the Term Loan B Credit Agreement on a 
pari passu
 basis with the liens securing the Company’s obligations under the Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement. In addition, effective November 1, 2024, Lone Star 
85
Table of Contents
Paving was joined as a borrower and its subsidiaries were joined as guarantors under the Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement. The amendment also modified certain negative covenants and adjusted the maximum consolidated net leverage ratio permitted under the Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement as follows: (i) for each fiscal quarter ending on or prior to September 30, 2024, a maximum consolidated net leverage ratio of 
3.50
 to 1.00; (ii) for each fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2024 through and including September 30, 2025, a maximum consolidated net leverage ratio of 
4.50
 to 1.00; (iii) for each fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2025 through and including September 30, 2026, a maximum consolidated net leverage ratio of 
4.00
 to 1.00; and (iv) for each fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2026 and thereafter, a maximum consolidated net leverage ratio of 
3.50
 to 1.00. 
Treasury Stock
In October and November 2024, the Company received a total of 
120,847
 shares of Class A common stock and 
2,653
 shares of Class B common stock from employees upon forfeitures of restricted stock awards and for reimbursement of income taxes paid by the Company on behalf of these employees related to restricted stock awards that vested on or subsequent to September 30, 2024.
