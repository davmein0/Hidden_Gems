Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements related to future events, business strategy, future performance, future operations, backlog, financial position, estimated revenues and losses, projected costs, prospects, plans and objectives of management. All statements other than statements of historical fact may be forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are often, but not always, identified by the use of words such as “seek,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “continue,” “estimate,” “expect,” “may,” “will,” “project,” “predict,” “potential,” “target,” “intend,” “could,” “might,” “should,” “believe,” “outlook” and similar expressions or their negative. Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results, and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by, which such performance or results will be achieved. Forward-looking statements are based on management’s belief, based on currently available information, as to the outcome and timing of future events. These statements involve estimates, assumptions, known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results or events to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements. When evaluating forward-looking statements, you should consider the risk factors and other cautionary statements described below under the heading “Risk Factors.” We believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements contained in this report are reasonable, but no assurance can be given that these expectations will prove to be correct. Important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: 
•
declines in public infrastructure construction and reductions in government funding, including the funding by transportation authorities and other state and local agencies;
•
risks related to our operating strategy;
•
competition for projects in our local markets;
•
risks associated with our capital-intensive business;
•
government inquiries, requirements and initiatives, including those related to funding for public infrastructure construction, land use, environmental, health and safety matters, and government contracting requirements and other laws and regulations;
•
unfavorable economic conditions and restrictive financing markets;
•
our ability to successfully identify, manage and integrate acquisitions;
•
our ability to obtain sufficient bonding capacity to undertake certain projects;
•
our ability to accurately estimate the overall risks, requirements or costs when we bid on or negotiate contracts that are ultimately awarded to us;
•
the cancellation of a significant number of contracts or our disqualification from bidding for new contracts;
•
risks related to adverse weather conditions;
•
climate change and related laws and regulations;
•
our substantial indebtedness and the restrictions imposed on us by the terms thereof;
•
our ability to manage our supply chain in a manner that ensures that we are able to obtain adequate raw materials, equipment and essential supplies;
•
our ability to retain key personnel and maintain satisfactory labor relations, and to manage or mitigate any labor shortages, turnover and labor cost increases;
•
the impact of inflation on costs of labor, raw materials and other items that are critical to our business, including fuel, concrete and steel;
•
unfavorable developments affecting the banking and financial services industry;
•
property damage and other claims and insurance coverage issues;
•
the outcome of litigation or disputes, including employment-related, workers’ compensation and breach of contract claims;
•
risks related to our information technology systems and infrastructure, including cybersecurity incidents;
•
our ability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting; and

•
other events outside of our control.
These factors are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could also cause actual results or events to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Our future results will depend upon various other risks and uncertainties, including those described under the heading “Risk Factors.” All forward-looking statements attributable to us are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date on which any such statement is made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.
