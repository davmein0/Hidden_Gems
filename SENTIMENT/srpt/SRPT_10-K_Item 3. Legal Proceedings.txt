Risk Factors Summary

Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described in Item 1A “Risk Factors”. These risks include, but are not limited to the following:

•
We are highly dependent on the commercial success of our products in the U.S. We may not be able to meet expectations with respect to sales of our products or maintain profitability and positive cash-flow from operations.

•
Even though EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53, AMONDYS 45 and ELEVIDYS (with respect to non-ambulatory patients) have received accelerated approval from the FDA, they face future post-approval development and regulatory requirements, which present additional challenges for us to successfully navigate.

•
Failure to obtain or maintain regulatory exclusivity for our products could result in our inability to protect our products from competition and our business may be adversely impacted.

•
We are subject to uncertainty relating to reimbursement policies which, if not favorable, could hinder or prevent the commercial success of our products and/or product candidates.

•
Our products may not be widely adopted by patients, payors or healthcare providers, which would adversely impact our potential profitability and future business prospects.

•
Historical revenues from eteplirsen, golodirsen and casimersen through our early access program (“EAP”) outside the U.S. may not continue and we may not be able to continue to distribute our products through our EAP.

•
We face intense competition and rapid technological change, which may result in other companies discovering, developing or commercializing competitive products.

•
We have entered into multiple collaborations and strategic transactions, including our collaboration with F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd (“Roche”) and our collaboration and license agreement with Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Arrowhead”), and may seek or engage in future collaborations, strategic alliances, acquisitions or licensing agreements that complement or expand our business. We may not be able to complete such transactions, and such transactions, if executed, may increase our capital requirements, dilute our stockholders, cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities and subject us to other risks.

•
We may find it difficult to enroll patients in our clinical trials, which could delay or prevent clinical trials of our product candidates.

•
Future sales of ELEVIDYS may decrease sales growth, or reduce sales, of EXONDYS 51, AMONDYS 45 and VYONDYS 53 (collectively, the “PMO Products”), which could negatively impact our operating results, including through potential inventory write-offs.

•
Failures or delays in the commencement or completion of ongoing and planned clinical trials of our product candidates could negatively impact commercialization efforts; result in increased costs; and delay, prevent or limit our ability to gain regulatory approval of product candidates and to generate revenues and continue our business.

•
Clinical development is lengthy and uncertain. Clinical trials of our product candidates may be delayed and certain programs may never advance in the clinic or may be more costly to conduct than we anticipate, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business.

•
Results from pre-clinical and early‑stage clinical trials may not be indicative of efficacy in late‑stage clinical trials, and pre-clinical and clinical trials may fail to demonstrate acceptable levels of safety, efficacy, and quality of our product candidates, which could prevent or significantly delay their regulatory approval.

•
Our product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of product candidates, limit the commercial potential or result in significant negative consequences following any 

-

potential marketing approval.

•
If there are significant delays in obtaining, or if we are unable to obtain or maintain required regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates in a timely manner or at all.

•
We are investing significant resources in the development of novel gene therapy product candidates. Only a few gene therapy products have been approved in the U.S. and the European Union (“EU”). If we are unable to show the safety and efficacy of these product candidates, experience delays in doing so or are unable to successfully commercialize these drugs, our business would be materially harmed.

•
Because we are developing product candidates for the treatment of certain diseases in which there is little clinical experience and we are using new endpoints or methodologies, there is increased risk that the FDA, the European Medicines Agency (the “EMA”) or other regulatory authorities may not consider the endpoints of our clinical trials to provide clinically meaningful results and that these results may be difficult to analyze. Accordingly, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities could interpret these data in different ways from us or our partners, which could delay, limit or prevent full or accelerated regulatory approval.

•
We may not be able to advance all of our programs, and we may use our financial and human resources to pursue particular programs and fail to capitalize on programs that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.

•
If we are unable to maintain our agreements with third parties to distribute our products to patients, our results of operations and business could be adversely affected.

•
We rely on third parties to conduct some aspects of our early stage research and pre-clinical and clinical development. The inadequate performance by or loss of any of these third parties could affect the development and commercialization of our product candidate development. The third parties we use in the manufacturing process for our products and product candidates may fail to comply with current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”) regulations.

•
We currently rely on third parties to manufacture our products and to produce our product candidates. Our dependence on these parties, including failure on our part to accurately anticipate product demand and timely secure manufacturing capacity to meet commercial, EAP, clinical and pre-clinical product demand may impair the availability of product to successfully support various programs, including research and development and the potential commercialization of additional product candidates in our pipeline.

•
Products intended for use in gene therapies are novel, complex and difficult to manufacture. We could experience production problems or inaccurately forecast demand for any of our product candidates, which could result in delays in our development or commercialization, limit supply or otherwise harm our business.

•
Our success, competitive position and future revenue depend in part on our ability and the abilities of our licensors and other collaborators to obtain, maintain and defend the patent protection for our products, product candidates, and platform technologies, to preserve our trade secrets, and to prevent third parties from infringing on our proprietary rights.

•
Our stock price is volatile and may fluctuate due to factors beyond our control.

•
Our existing and any future indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to operate our business
. 

•
Our revenues and operating results could fluctuate significantly, which may adversely affect our stock price and our ability to maintain profitability.
