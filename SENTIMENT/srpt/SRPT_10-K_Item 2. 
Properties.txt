Overview

We are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on helping patients through the discovery and development of unique RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene therapy and other genetic therapeutic modalities for the treatment of rare diseases. Applying our proprietary, highly differentiated and innovative technologies, and through collaborations with our strategic partners, we have developed multiple approved products for the treatment of Duchenne and are developing potential therapeutic candidates for a broad range of diseases and disorders, including Duchenne, LGMDs, and other neuromuscular and central nervous system related disorders.

We commercialized four products that have been approved by the FDA:

•
The PMO Products:

o
EXONDYS 51 (eteplirsen) Injection (“EXONDYS 51”), granted accelerated approval by the FDA on September 19, 2016, is indicated for the treatment of Duchenne in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene that is amenable to exon 51 skipping. EXONDYS 51 uses our PMO chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 51 of the dystrophin gene. 

o
VYONDYS 53 (golodirsen) Injection (“VYONDYS 53”), granted accelerated approval by the FDA on December 12, 2019, is indicated for the treatment of Duchenne in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene that is amenable to exon 53 skipping. VYONDYS 53 uses our PMO chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 53 of the dystrophin gene. 

o
AMONDYS 45 (casimersen) Injection (“AMONDYS 45”), granted accelerated approval by the FDA on February 25, 2021, is indicated for the treatment of Duchenne in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene that is amenable to exon 45 skipping. AMONDYS 45 uses our PMO chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 45 of the dystrophin gene. 

•
ELEVIDYS (delandistrogene moxeparvovec-rokl), approved by the FDA on June 20, 2024, is an AAV-based gene therapy for the treatment of ambulatory patients at least four years old with Duchenne with a confirmed mutation in the Duchenne gene. ELEVIDYS is also approved for non-ambulatory patients under the accelerated approval pathway. ELEVIDYS was previously granted accelerated approval by the FDA on June 22, 2023 for the treatment of ambulatory patients aged four through five years with Duchenne with a confirmed mutation in the Duchenne gene. ELEVIDYS is contraindicated in patients with any deletion in exon 8 and/or exon 9 in the Duchenne gene.

We are in the process of conducting various clinical trials for our approved products, including studies that are required to comply with our post-marketing FDA requirements/commitments to verify and describe the clinical benefit of these products.

-
71
-

A summary description of our key product candidates, including those in collaboration with our strategic partners, is as follows:

•
SRP-9003 (LGMD, gene therapy program)
. We are developing gene therapy programs for various forms of LGMD. The most advanced of our LGMD product candidates, SRP-9003, aims to treat LGMD2E, also known as beta-sarcoglycanopathy, a severe and debilitating form of LGMD characterized by progressive muscle fiber loss, inflammation and muscle fiber replacement with fat and fibrotic tissue. SRP-9003 is designed to transfect a gene that codes for and restores beta-sarcoglycan protein with the goal of restoring the dystrophin associated protein complex. SRP-9003 has generated positive pre-clinical safety and efficacy data utilizing the AAVrh.74 vector, the same vector used in our SRP-9001 gene therapy program. A Phase 1/2a trial of SRP-9003 commenced in the fourth quarter of 2018. In June 2020, we announced safety and expression results from three clinical trial participants in the high-dose cohort measured at 60 days, and one-year functional data from three clinical trial participants in the low-dose cohort. In March 2022, we announced 36-month functional data from three clinical trial participants in the low-dose cohort and 24-month functional data from two clinical trial participants in the high-dose cohort. In December 2024, we announced that we had completed enrollment and dosing in EMERGENE (Study SRP-9003-301), a Phase 3 clinical trial of SRP-9003 (bidridistrogene xeboparvovec).

Our pipeline includes programs in various stages of pre-clinical and clinical development, reflecting our multifaceted approach and expertise in precision genetic medicine to make a profound difference in the lives of patients suffering from rare diseases.

We have developed proprietary state-of-the-art CMC and manufacturing capabilities that allow synthesis and purification of our products and product candidates to support both clinical development as well as commercialization. Our current main focus in manufacturing is to sustain large-scale production of our PMO-based therapies and optimizing manufacturing for gene therapy-based product candidates. We have entered into certain manufacturing and supply arrangements with third-party suppliers and will utilize these capabilities to support production of certain of our products and product candidates and their components. In 2017, we opened a facility in Andover, Massachusetts, which significantly enhanced our research and development manufacturing capabilities. However, we currently do not have internal large scale GMP manufacturing capabilities to produce our products and product candidates for commercial and/or clinical use.

The likelihood of our long-term success must be considered in light of the expenses, difficulties and delays frequently encountered in the development and commercialization of new pharmaceutical products, competitive factors in the marketplace, the risks associated with government sponsored reimbursement programs and the complex regulatory environment in which we operate.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities for the periods presented. Some of these judgments can be subjective and complex, and, consequently, actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe that the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon historical experience and information available to us at the time that we make these estimates and judgments. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our consolidated financial statements will be affected. Although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate, actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:

•
inventory; and

•
income tax.

Inventory Valuation

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. We capitalize inventory costs associated with products following regulatory approval when future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized. EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53, AMONDYS 45 and ELEVIDYS inventory that may be used in clinical development programs is charged to research and development expense when the product enters the research and development process and no longer can be used for commercial purposes.

We periodically analyze our inventories for excess amounts or obsolescence and write down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value based on assumptions about expected future demand and market conditions. Additionally, though our products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring, which we perform throughout the manufacturing processes, certain batches or units of product may not meet quality specifications. Expense incurred related to excess

-
72
-

inventory, obsolete inventory, or inventories that do not meet our quality specifications is recorded as a component of cost of sales in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).

Income Tax

We follow the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the net deferred tax asset to zero when it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will not be realized. As of December 31, 2024, we continued to maintain a full valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets, with the exception of deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions, based on management's evaluation of all available evidence, including our earnings history.

We will continue to monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets in future periods. We may release all or a portion of the valuation allowance in the near-term; however, the release of the valuation allowance, as well as the exact timing and the amount of such release, continue to be subject to, among other things, our level of profitability, revenue growth and expectations regarding future profitability. If and when we determine the valuation allowance should be released or reduced, the adjustment would result in a benefit to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded, which could have a material impact on net earnings.

We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon an examination. The calculation of our tax liabilities (or amount of reduction in our deferred tax assets from net operating loss carryover and research credit carryover) resulting from uncertain tax positions can involve significant judgment. Further, the calculation may involve the application of complex tax regulations in a foreign jurisdiction. Any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts, law, tax rates, tax audit, or review could lead to adjustments to our deferred tax asset, income tax expense, our effective tax rate, and/or our cash flow. Although we believe that we have adequately provided for tax liabilities resulting from uncertain tax positions, the actual amounts paid, if any, could have a material impact on our results of operations. Interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions are classified as a component of income tax expense.

** Related to the recognition of previously deferred revenue under the Roche collaboration agreement as the Company satisfies its performance obligations under the contract. For more information, please read 
Note 3, License and Collaboration Agreements
.

Collaboration and other revenues relate to our collaboration arrangement with Roche. For 2024 and 2023, we recognized $114.0 million and $98.5 million of collaboration and other revenues, respectively. In accordance with the Roche Agreement, the parties agreed to enter into a supply agreement in order for us to supply Roche with clinical and commercial batches of ELEVIDYS (the “Supply Agreement”). Roche utilizes the supply for sales of ELEVIDYS in territories outside of the U.S where Roche has received certain approvals for ELEVIDYS. We are eligible to receive royalties on these sales. While the Supply Agreement is in the process of being negotiated, we delivered batches of commercial ELEVIDYS supply to Roche that were agreed upon on a purchase order-by-purchase order basis. For 2024 and 2023, we recognized $49.0 million and $9.2 million of contract manufacturing revenue, respectively, which is related to these Roche shipments. In addition, we recognized $17.0 million of royalty revenue from sales of ELEVIDYS by Roche in 2024, with no similar activity for 2023. For 2024, we recognized $48.0 million in collaboration revenue related to Roche’s declined option to acquire the ex-US rights to a certain external, early-stage Duchenne development program, as compared to the $89.2 million in collaboration revenue in 2023 related to the amortization of the single, combined performance obligation under the Roche Agreement, which was fully amortized as of December 31, 2023. Please refer to 
Note 3, License and Collaboration Agreements
 for further discussion of the Roche Agreement.

Cost of sales (excluding amortization of in-licensed rights)

Our cost of sales (excluding amortization of in-licensed rights) consists of inventory costs that relate to sales of our products and the related overhead costs and royalty payments primarily to BioMarin and UWA for our PMO Products and to Nationwide for ELEVIDYS. Prior to receiving regulatory approval for our products, we expensed manufacturing and material costs as research and development expenses. For the PMO Products, all previously expensed manufacturing costs had been fully consumed prior to 2023. For ELEVIDYS sold in 2024, a portion of related manufacturing costs incurred had previously been expensed as research and development expenses. For ELEVIDYS sold in 2023, the majority of related manufacturing costs incurred had previously been expensed as research and development expenses. If product related costs had not previously been expensed as research and development expenses prior to receiving FDA approval, the incremental inventory costs related to ELEVIDYS sold, including products sold to Roche under the Roche Agreement, would have been approximately $100.8 million and $33.9 million higher for 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The cost of sales (excluding amortization of in-licensed rights) for 2024 increased by $168.8 million, or 112%, compared with 2023. The change primarily reflects an increase in cost of sales related to ELEVIDYS due to an increase in demand following its initial FDA approval in June 2023 and subsequent expanded label approval in June 2024, as well as increases in the write-offs of certain batches of our products not meeting our quality specifications. For 2024 and 2023, we recognized $22.2 million and $1.8 million, respectively, of cost of sales related to products sold to Roche under the Roche Agreement.

Research and development expenses

Research and development expenses consist of costs associated with research activities as well as those associated with our product development efforts, conducting pre-clinical trials, clinical trials and manufacturing activities. Direct research and development expenses associated with our programs include clinical trial site costs, clinical manufacturing costs, costs incurred for consultants, up-front fees and milestones paid to third parties in connection with technologies that have not reached technological feasibility and do not have an alternative future use, and other external services, such as data management and statistical analysis support, and materials and supplies used in support of clinical programs. Indirect costs of our programs include salaries, stock-based compensation and allocation of our facility- and technology-related costs.

Research and development expenses represent a substantial percentage of our total operating expenses. We do not maintain or evaluate and, therefore, do not allocate internal research and development costs on a project-by-project basis. As a result, a significant portion of our research and development expenses are not tracked on a project-by-project basis, as the costs may benefit multiple projects.

*Beginning in 2024, we implemented an updated manufacturing absorption methodology that allocates the absorption of indirect manufacturing costs to their respective originating categories. Research and development expenses by category, specifically, manufacturing expenses, compensation and other personnel expenses, facility- and technology-related expenses and professional services, have been reclassified for 2023 for comparability. This reallocation has no impact on the total research and development expenses recognized.

Research and development expenses for 2024 decreased by $72.9 million, or 8%, compared with 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by the following:

$16.8 million decrease in manufacturing expenses primarily due to the capitalization of commercial batches of ELEVIDYS manufactured upon its approval in June 2023, a decrease in clinical batches for our PPMO platform as a result of our decision to discontinue our PPMO programs during 2024, partially offset by $91.9 million of costs associated with the termination of the development, commercial manufacturing and supply agreement (the “Thermo Agreement”) related to Brammer Bio MA, LLC, an affiliate of Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. (“Thermo”) in August 2024 and an increase in costs associated with our LGMD gene therapy programs. Please refer to 
Note 22, Commitments and Contingencies 
for further discussion of the Thermo Agreement;

•
$2.6 million increase in compensation and other personnel expenses primarily due to changes in headcount, partially offset by an increase in indirect manufacturing costs absorption offset as a result of ELEVIDYS approval in June 2023; 

•
$23.7 million decrease in clinical trial expenses primarily due to a decrease in activity for our PPMO platform and our decision to discontinue our PPMO programs in November 2024, as well as a ramp-down of the ESSENCE studies for AMONDYS 45 and VYONDYS 53;

•
$3.4 million increase in facility- and technology-related expenses primarily due to our continuing expansion efforts, partially offset by an increase in indirect manufacturing costs absorption offset as a result of ELEVIDYS approval in June 2023;

•
$8.5 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense primarily due to an increase in indirect manufacturing costs absorption offset as a result of ELEVIDYS approval in June 2023, partially offset by the achievement of performance conditions related to certain restricted stock units with performance conditions (“PSUs”) during 2024;

•
$3.9 million increase in professional services primarily due to an increase in reliance on third-party research and development contractors for clinical programs, partially offset by an increase in indirect manufacturing costs absorption offset as a result of ELEVIDYS approval in June 2023;

•
$5.5 million decrease in pre-clinical expenses primarily due to a decrease in activity in our PPMO platform and decision to discontinue our PPMO programs in November 2024;

•
$8.5 million decrease in research and other expenses primarily due to timing of achievement of certain up-front and milestone payments, partially offset by an increase in sponsored research with academic institutions during 2024; and 

•
$19.7 million increase in the offset to expense associated with a collaboration reimbursement from Roche due to reimbursable costs associated with the termination of the Thermo Agreement during 2024, with no similar activity during 2023. This was partially offset by a decrease in clinical supply costs due to timing for our SRP-9001 gene therapy programs.

Selling, general and administrative expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and related costs for personnel in our executive, finance, legal, information technology, business development, human resources, commercial and other general and administrative functions. Other general and administrative expenses include an allocation of our facility- and technology-related costs and professional fees for legal, consulting and accounting services.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2024 increased by $76.0 million, or 16%, compared with 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the following:

•
$25.2 million increase in professional service expenses primarily related to ongoing litigation matters, our continuing expansion efforts and continuing efforts to commercialize ELEVIDYS;

•
$14.2 million increase in compensation and other personnel expenses primarily due to changes in headcount; 

•
$10.3 million increase in stock-based compensation expense primarily related to the achievement of performance conditions related to certain PSUs during the year ended December 31, 2024 and changes in headcount; 

•
$6.8 million increase in facility- and technology-related expenses primarily due to our continuing expansion efforts; and

•
$20.1 million increase in other expenses primarily due to the timing of charitable contribution activity.

Amortization of in-licensed rights

Amortization of in-licensed rights relates to the agreements we entered into with UWA, Nationwide, BioMarin and Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy in April 2013, December 2016, July 2017 and May 2018, respectively. Each in-licensed right is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the relevant patent from the date the related fee was incurred, either the regulatory approval or the first commercial sale of the applicable product. For 2024 and 2023, we recorded amortization of in-licensed rights of $2.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively.

Other income (expense), net

Other income (expense), net primarily consists of interest expense on our debt instruments, interest income on our cash, cash equivalents and investments, amortization of investment premium or accretion of investment discount, unrealized gain or loss from our investment in our strategic investments, the changes in the fair value of the derivative assets associated with the capped call options for our convertible senior notes due on November 15, 2024 (the “2024 Notes”) and the changes in the fair value of contingent consideration related to regulatory-related contingent payments meeting the definition of a derivative liability. Our cash equivalents and investments consist of money market funds, corporate bonds, government and government agency debt securities and certificates of deposit.

Other income, net for 2024 increased by approximately $9.6 million compared to 2023. The change is primarily due to the impairment of a strategic investment during 2023, with no similar activity during 2024. This change was partially offset by a decrease in interest income and accretion of investment discount, net as a result of lower interest rates and the investment mix of our investment portfolio and an increase in the fair value of derivatives, primarily related to contingent consideration.

Loss on debt extinguishment

On March 2, 2023, we entered into separate, privately negotiated exchange agreements with certain holders of the outstanding 2024 Notes, which resulted in an exchange of $313.5 million in aggregate principal value of the 2024 Notes for approximately 4.5 million shares of our common stock (the “2024 Notes Exchange”). The exchange was not pursuant to the conversion privileges included in the terms of the debt at issuance and, therefore, was accounted for as a debt extinguishment, resulting in a recognition of an extinguishment loss of $387.3 million for 2023. There was no similar activity in 2024.

Gain from sale of Priority Review Voucher

In June 2023, we entered into an agreement to sell the rare pediatric disease Priority Review Voucher (“ELEVIDYS PRV”) we received from the FDA in connection with the approval of ELEVIDYS for consideration of $102.0 million, with no commission costs. The transaction was not subject to the conditions set forth under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and closed in June 2023. The net proceeds were recorded as a gain from sale of the ELEVIDYS PRV for 2023 as it did not have a carrying value at the time of the sale. There was no similar activity in 2024.

Income tax expense

-
78
-

Income tax expense for 2024 and 2023 was approximately $25.5 million and $15.9 million, respectively. Income tax expense for 2024 and 2023 relates to state, foreign and federal taxes for which available tax losses or credits were not available to offset. As of December 31, 2024, we continued to maintain a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, with the exception of deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions. We continue to monitor the available evidence relative to recovery of our deferred tax assets and whether such evidence would be sufficient to conclude that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets may be partially or fully recoverable. If we were to remove our valuation allowance in part or full, any such adjustment could have a material impact on our effective tax rate in the applicable period and beyond. Refer to 
Note 18, Income Taxes
 for discussion of the key drivers impacting our effective tax rate.

For 2024 and 2023, our principal sources of liquidity were primarily derived from sales of our products, net proceeds from sale of the ELEVIDYS PRV, proceeds from the settlement of capped call options associated with the 2024 Notes (the “2017 Capped Calls”) and our collaboration arrangement with Roche. Our principal uses of cash are research and development expenses, manufacturing costs, selling, general and administrative expenses, investments, capital expenditures, business development transactions, settlement of long-term debt and other working capital requirements.

Refer to 
Note 13, Indebtedness 
and 
Note 19, Leases 
for additional discussion of our outstanding indebtedness and material changes to our leasing obligations, respectively. The changes in our working capital primarily reflect the use of cash in operating activities, as well as an increase in inventory due to the capitalization of ELEVIDYS inventory after its approval in June 2023. While our contractual obligations, commitments and debt service requirements over the next several years are significant, we intend to continue to fund our short-term financing needs and working capital requirements from cash flows of operating activities as well as cash on hand and such sources are anticipated to be adequate to fund working capital requirements for at least twelve months from the date these consolidated financial statements were issued.

Beyond 2025, our cash requirements will depend extensively on our ability to advance our research, development and commercialization of product candidates. We may seek additional financings primarily from, but not limited to, the sale and issuance of equity and debt securities, the licensing or sale of our technologies and entering into additional government contracts and/or funded research and development agreements. Our future expenditures and long-term capital requirements may be substantial and will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the following:

•
our ability to continue to generate revenues from sales of commercial products and potential future products;

•
the timing and costs associated with our expansion efforts;

•
the timing and costs associated with repurchases of our common stock under our $500.0 million share repurchase program, approved by our Board of Directors in November 2024 and effective for 18 months;

•
the timing and costs of building out our manufacturing capabilities;

•
the timing of payments related to our future inventory commitments and manufacturing obligations;

-
79
-

•
the timing and costs associated with our existing lease obligations and new obligations expected to be entered into in future years;

•
the timing and costs associated with our clinical trials and pre-clinical trials;

•
the attainment of milestones and our obligations to make milestone payments to Arrowhead, Myonexus's selling shareholders, BioMarin, Nationwide, UWA and other institutions; 

•
obligations to holders of our 1.25% convertible senior notes due on September 15, 2027 (“2027 Notes”); and

•
the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and our other intellectual property rights.

We cannot provide assurances that financing will be available when and as needed or that, if available, the financings will be on favorable or acceptable terms. If we are unable to obtain additional financing when and if we require, this would have a material adverse effect on our business and the results of operations. To the extent we issue additional equity securities, our existing stockholders could experience substantial dilution. We believe that existing cash and cash equivalents, along with future cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet the capital requirements of our operations for the next 12 months and foreseeable future.

We have entered into long-term contractual arrangements from time to time for our facilities, the provision of goods and services, and issuance of debt securities, among others. Additional information regarding our obligations under debt, lease, and manufacturing arrangements is provided in 
Note 13, Indebtedness, Note 19, Leases, Note 22, Commitments and Contingencies 
and 
Note 23, Subsequent event,

(1) Interest payments are included within the future debt obligations.

(2) Lease obligations only include real estate leases that had commenced prior to December 31, 2024.

(3) The leases embedded in a certain supply agreement are included in manufacturing obligations. The increase in short-term manufacturing commitments is primarily driven by ramp-up of ELEVIDYS manufacturing activities as a result of anticipated increase in demand.

For products and product candidates that are currently approved or are in various research and development stages, we may be obligated to make up to $2.3 billion of future development, regulatory, up-front royalty and sales milestone payments associated with our license and collaboration agreements. Excluded from this metric are $10.3 billion of future development, regulatory and sales milestone payments associated with our license and collaboration agreement with Arrowhead, as the transaction had not closed as of December 31, 2024. When the license and collaboration agreement with Arrowhead became effective in February 2025, we paid Arrowhead an up-front payment of $500.0 million and invested $325.0 million in Arrowhead's common stock at a premium to the valuation on the closing date. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable upon achievement of certain development, regulatory or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones is not probable and payment is not required as of December 31, 2024, such contingencies have not been recorded in our consolidated financial statements. Amounts related to contingent milestone payments are not yet considered contractual obligations as they are contingent on the successful achievement of certain development, regulatory approval and commercial milestones.

Operating Activities

Cash used in operating activities, which consists of our net income (loss) adjusted for non-cash items and changes in net operating assets and liabilities, totaled $205.8 million and $501.0 million of cash in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash used in operating activities in 2024 was primarily driven by the net income of $235.2 million, adjusted for the following non-cash items:

•
$184.3 million in stock-based compensation expense;

•
$62.7 million in non-cash termination charges as a result of the Thermo Agreement termination;

•
$37.7 million in depreciation and amortization expense;

•
$16.2 million reduction in the carrying amount of the right of use assets;

•
$7.8 million charge related to the change in the fair value of derivatives; and

•
$7.1 million in other non-cash items.

These amounts were partially offset by $40.3 million in accretion of investment discount, net.

The net cash outflow from changes in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by the following:

•
$395.2 million increase in inventory primarily due to capitalized inventory related to ELEVIDYS;

•
$201.7 million increase in accounts receivable due to an increase in demand for ELEVIDYS following its initial FDA approval in June 2023 and subsequent expanded label approval in June 2024 and an increase in payment terms for product sales related to the PMO Products;

•
$188.6 million increase in manufacturing-related deposits and prepaids primarily due to an increase in prepaids for raw materials and batch fees with Catalent, partially offset by decreases in manufacturing-related deposits and prepaids at Thermo as a result of the termination of the Thermo Agreement during 2024; and

•
$32.2 million decrease in deferred revenue primarily related to the collaboration with Roche.

These amounts were partially offset by a $110.6 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses, lease liabilities and other liabilities primarily due to the timing and invoicing of payments with our CROs and CMOs.

Cash used in operating activities in 2023 was primarily driven by the net loss of $536.0 million, adjusted for the following non-cash items:

•
$387.3 million in loss on debt extinguishment of the 2024 Notes;

•
$182.5 million in stock-based compensation expense;

•
$44.4 million in depreciation and amortization expense;

•
$30.3 million in impairments associated with our strategic investments; and

•
$19.7 million in other non-cash items.

These amounts were partially offset by the gain of $102.0 million recorded from the sale of the ELEVIDYS PRV and $46.2 million in accretion of investment discount, net.

The net cash outflow from changes in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by the following:

-
81
-

•
$185.7 million increase in accounts receivable due to the launch of ELEVIDYS and an increase in the demand of our PMO Products;

•
$147.7 million increase in inventory primarily due to capitalized inventory related to ELEVIDYS;

•
$86.8 million decrease in deferred revenue primarily related to the collaboration with Roche;

•
$50.1 million decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses, lease liabilities and other liabilities, primarily due to the $54.0 million shortfall payment to Thermo and payments to Catalent for raw materials in 2023 and the overall timing and invoicing of payments; and

•
$12.5 million increase in manufacturing-related deposits and prepaids primarily due to the timing and usage of manufacturing prepaids.

Investing Activities

Cash provided by investing activities for 2024 was $755.6 million, while cash used by investing activities for 2023 was $165.8 million. Cash provided by investing activities in 2024 consisted of $2,002.1 million from the maturity and sales of available-for-sale securities, partially offset by purchases of available-for-sale securities, property and equipment and intangible assets of $1,099.6 million, $137.0 million and $10.0 million, respectively.

Cash used in investing activities in 2023 primarily consisted of purchases of available-for-sale securities, property and equipment and intangible assets of $2,044.9 million, $76.1 million and $11.2 million, respectively, partially offset by $1,868.5 million from the maturity and sales of available-for-sale securities and $102.0 million of net proceeds related to the sale of the ELEVIDYS PRV.

Financing Activities

Cash provided by financing activities was $124.8 million in 2024, compared to $125.0 million in 2023. Cash provided by financing activities in 2024 primarily consisted of $79.5 million in proceeds from exercise of options and purchase of stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Program and $45.3 million in proceeds from the settlement of the 2017 Capped Calls.

Cash provided by financing activities in 2023 consisted of $80.6 million in partial settlement the 2017 Capped Calls and $51.2 million in proceeds from exercise of options and purchase of stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Program, partially offset by $6.9 million in third-party debt conversion costs related to the 2024 Notes Exchange.

Other Funding Commitments

We have several on-going clinical trials in various development stages. Our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to CROs. The CRO contracts are generally cancellable at our option. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $594.5 million in cancellable future commitments based on existing CRO contracts.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Please read 
Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements
 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualita
tive Disclosures About Market Risk.

Our current investment policy is to maintain a diversified investment portfolio consisting of money market investments, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, government and government agency bonds and high-grade corporate bonds with maturities of 24 months or less. Our cash is primarily deposited in and invested through highly rated financial institutions in the U.S. As of December 31, 2024, we had $1,503.5 million of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments, comprised of $384.9 million of investments, $1,103.0 million of cash and cash equivalents and $15.6 million of restricted cash. All our debt securities are classified as available-for-sale. The fair value of cash equivalents and investments is subject to change as a result of potential changes in market interest rates. The potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments has been assessed on a hypothetical 10 basis point adverse movement across all maturities. As of December 31, 2024, we estimate that such hypothetical 10 basis point adverse movement would result in a hypothetical loss in fair value of approximately $0.3 million to our interest rate sensitive instruments.

Our $1,150.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 2027 Notes has a fixed interest rate of 1.25% per annum, payable semi-annually in cash on each March 15 and September 15, and therefore is not subject to fluctuations in market interest rates.

Item 8. Financial Statem
ents and Supplementary Data.

The information required by this Item 8 begins on page F-1 in Item 15 of Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated into this item by reference.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Acc
ountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.

None.

Item 9A. Control
s and Procedures.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We carried out an evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to paragraph (b) of Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Based on that review, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act (1) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and (2) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control procedure, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control procedure are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. We considered these limitations during the development of our disclosure controls and procedures, and will continually reevaluate them to ensure they provide reasonable assurance that such controls and procedures are effective.

Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for our Company, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.

Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that:

•
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;

•
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and

•
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the 
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 
in its 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework.

Based on this assessment, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There have not been material changes in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a–15(f) and 15d–15(f) under the Exchange Act for the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that our certifying officers concluded materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 9B. Othe
r Information.

Michael A. Chambers
 Living Trust, an affiliate of Michael Chambers, entered into and 
adopted
 a written plan for the sale of our securities that is intended to satisfy the conditions specified in Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act for an affirmative defense against liability for trading in securities on the basis of material nonpublic information (a “Rule 10b5-1 trading plan”). Mr. Chambers' 10b5-1 trading plan has an adoption date of 
December 16, 2024
 and an end date of 
September 12, 2025

Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Basis for Opinions

The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

F-
2

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Evaluation of lower of cost or net realizable value of raw materials inventory

As described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, approximately 30%, or $280.0 million, of the Company’s total inventory balance is comprised of raw materials. As discussed in Note 2, the Company periodically analyzes its inventories, and writes down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value.

We identified the evaluation of lower of cost or net realizable value of certain raw materials inventory as a critical audit matter. The estimate of expected future demand for raw materials inventory is difficult to assess and results in the application of greater auditor judgment. Specifically, challenging auditor judgment was required to assess the potential impact the Company’s gene therapy technologies and competitor RNA-targeted therapeutic or gene therapy products could have on certain existing raw materials inventory.

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of a control related to the future demand for raw materials. We compared the Company’s prior period forecasted demand for raw materials to actual results to assess their ability to accurately estimate expected future demand. We evaluated clinical progress associated with the Company’s gene therapy technologies, including the limited approval by the FDA of ELEVIDYS during 2023 and expanded approval in 2024, by inspecting internal meeting minutes and interviewing research and development personnel of the Company and assessed the potential impact of those technologies on expected future demand for certain raw materials inventory. We inquired of manufacturing personnel and evaluated the expiry of certain raw materials. We also read publicly available information to identify other competitor entities with RNA-targeted therapeutic or gene therapy products that could impact the Company’s estimates of expected future demand.

Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS
Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, “Sarepta” or the “Company”) is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on helping patients through the discovery and development of unique RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene therapy and other genetic therapeutic modalities for the treatment of rare diseases. Applying its proprietary, highly-differentiated and innovative technologies, and through collaborations with its strategic partners, the Company has developed multiple approved products for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (“Duchenne”) and is developing potential therapeutic candidates for a broad range of diseases and disorders, including Duchenne, Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (“LGMDs”) and other neuromuscular and central nervous system (“CNS”) disorders.

The Company's products in the U.S., EXONDYS 51 (eteplirsen) Injection (“EXONDYS 51”), VYONDYS 53 (golodirsen) Injection (“VYONDYS 53”) and AMONDYS 45 (casimersen) Injection (“AMONDYS 45”), were granted accelerated approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) in 2016, 2019 and 2021, respectively. Indicated for the treatment of Duchenne in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene that is amenable to exon 51, exon 53 and exon 45 skipping, respectively, EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53 and AMONDYS 45 (collectively, the “PMO Products”) use the Company’s phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (“PMO”) chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 51, exon 53 and exon 45 of the dystrophin gene. Exon skipping is intended to promote the production of an internally truncated but functional dystrophin protein.

ELEVIDYS (delandistrogene moxeparvovec-rokl), approved by the FDA on June 20, 2024, is an adeno-associated virus-(“AAV”) based gene therapy for the treatment of ambulatory patients at least four years old with Duchenne with a confirmed mutation in the Duchenne gene. ELEVIDYS is also approved for non-ambulatory patients under the accelerated approval pathway. ELEVIDYS was previously granted accelerated approval by the FDA in June 2023 for the treatment of ambulatory patients aged four through five years with Duchenne with a confirmed mutation in the Duchenne gene. ELEVIDYS is contraindicated in patients with any deletion in exon 8 and/or exon 9 in the Duchenne gene.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately $
1,503.5
 million of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments, consisting of $
1,103.0
 million of cash and cash equivalents, $
384.9
 million of investments and $
15.6
 million of restricted cash. 
The Company believes that its balance of cash, cash equivalents and investments as of the date of the issuance of this report is sufficient to fund its current operational plan for at least the next twelve months, though it may pursue additional cash resources through public or private debt and equity financings, seek funded research and development arrangements and additional government contracts and establish collaborations with or license its technology to other companies.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
AND RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Basis of Presentation

Estimates and Uncertainties
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fair Value Measurements
The Company has certain financial assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value which have been classified as Level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy as described in the accounting standards for fair value measurements:
•
Level 1—quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets;
•
Level 2—quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and
•
Level 3—valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant value drivers are unobservable.
The fair value of the majority of the Company’s financial assets is categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. These assets include commercial paper, government and government agency bonds, corporate bonds and certificates of deposit. For additional information related to fair value measurements, please read 
Note 5, Fair Value Measurements
 to the consolidated financial statements.
Cash Equivalents
Only investments that are highly liquid and readily convertible to cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition are considered cash equivalents.
Investments
Available-For-Sale Debt Securities
Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity. Interest income and realized gains and losses are reported in other income (expense), net, on a specific identification basis. The amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, the net amount of which, along with interest and realized gains and losses, is included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).
Equity Investments
The Company’s equity investments include its strategic investments in both publicly traded and private biotechnology companies and are included in other non-current assets in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The strategic investment in the publicly traded biotechnology company has a readily determinable fair value and is carried at fair value. The strategic investment in the privately held biotechnology company does not have a readily determinable fair value and is measured at cost less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Any change in the valuation of equity investments is recorded as a gain or loss on the Company’s consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).
Accounts Receivable, Net

The Company’s accounts receivable, net arise from product sales. They are generally stated at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest.

The accounts receivable, net from product sales represents receivables due from the Company’s specialty distributor and specialty pharmacies and sites of care in the U.S., as well as certain distributors in South America, Europe, and the Middle East. Historically, the Company has had no material write-offs of its accounts receivable, net. Payment terms range from

60
 to 
90 days
 for sales within the U.S. a
nd 
60
 and 
150 
days
 for the majority of product sales outside the U.S. The Company monitors the financial performance and creditworthiness of its customers so that it can properly assess and respond to changes in the customers’ credit profiles or any specific issues. The Company provides reserves against trade receivables for expected credit losses that may result from a customer’s inability to pay. Amounts determined to be uncollectible are written-off against the established reserve. As of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023
, the credit profiles for the Company’s customers are deemed to be in good standing and an allowance for expected credit losses is not considered necessary.

Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash held at financial institutions, cash equivalents, investments and accounts receivable, net from customers. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s cash was concentrated at three financial institutions, which potentially exposes the Company to credit risks. However, the Company does not believe that there is significant risk of non-performance by the financial institutions. The Company also purchases commercial paper, government and government agency bonds, corporate bonds and certificates of deposit issued by highly rated corporations, financial institutions and governments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. These amounts may at times exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any credit losses related to these financial instruments and does not believe to be exposed to any significant credit risk related to these instruments. As of December 31, 2024, three entities accounted for 
54
%
, 
21
%
, and 
13
%
 of accounts receivable, net, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, four entities accounted for 
40
%
, 
19
%
, 
19
%
, and 
12
%
 of accounts receivable, net, respectively.

Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. The Company capitalizes inventory costs associated with products following regulatory approval when future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized. EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53, AMONDYS 45 and ELEVIDYS inventory used in clinical development programs is charged to research and development expense when the product enters the research and development process and can no longer be used for commercial purposes.

The Company periodically analyzes its inventories for excess amounts or obsolescence and writes down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value. Additionally, though the Company’s products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring the Company performs throughout the manufacturing processes, certain batches or units of product may not meet quality specifications. Expense incurred related to excess inventory, obsolete inventory, or inventories that do not meet the Company's quality specifications is recorded as a component of cost of sales in the Company's consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).
For products which are under development and have not yet been approved by regulatory authorities, purchased drug product is charged to research and development expense upon delivery. Delivery occurs when the inventory passes quality inspection and ownership transfers to the Company. Nonrefundable advance payments for research and development activities, including production of purchased drug product, are deferred and capitalized until the goods are delivered. If the Company does not expect the goods to be delivered or services to be rendered, the capitalized advanced payment will be charged to expense.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are initially recorded at cost, including the acquisition cost and all costs necessarily incurred to bring the asset to the location and working condition necessary for their intended use. The cost of normal, recurring or periodic repairs and maintenance activities related to property and equipment are expensed as incurred. The cost for planned major maintenance activities, including the related acquisition or construction of assets, is capitalized if the repair will result in future economic benefits. Interest costs incurred during the construction period of major capital projects are periodically reviewed, and if determined to be material, capitalized until the asset is ready for its intended use, at which point the interest costs are amortized as depreciation expense over the life of the underlying asset.

The Company generally depreciates the cost of its property and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which are summarized as follows:

Intangible assets
The Company’s intangible assets, consisting of in-licensed rights, patent costs and software licenses, are included within other non-current assets in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

The in-licensed rights primarily relate to agreements with BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. (“BioMarin”), the University of Western Australia (“UWA”), the Research Institute at Nationwide Children’s Hospital (“Nationwide”) and Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy (“PPMD”). The in-licensed rights are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the related patents because the life of the related patents reflects the expected time period that the Company will benefit from the in-licensed rights.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets held and used by the Company, intangible assets with definite lives and right of use (“ROU”) assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. The Company evaluates recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Such reviews assess the fair value of the assets based upon estimates of future cash flows that the assets are expected to generate.
Convertible Debt

The Company accounts for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that can be settled in cash as a single liability measured at its amortized cost, as long as no other features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives under ASC Topic 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging 
(“ASC 815”). Simultaneously with the issuance of the Company's convertible senior notes due on November 15, 2024 (the “2024 Notes”) and convertible senior notes due on September 15, 2027 (the “2027 Notes”) in November 2017 and September 2022, respectively, the Company bought capped call options from certain counterparties to minimize the impact of potential dilution upon conversion. The premium for the capped call options was recorded as additional paid-in capital. For additional information related to the convertible debt transactions, please read 
Note 13, Indebtedness
 to the consolidated financial statements.
Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for the goods or services provided. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements within the scope of ASC Topic 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
(“ASC 606”), the Company performs the following five steps: (1) identify the contract with the customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers or provides to the customer. At contract inception, the Company assesses the goods or services promised within each contract and determines those that are performance obligations, and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. The Company then recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when or as the performance obligation is satisfied. The only performance obligation in the Company’s contracts with customers is to timely deliver drug products to the customer’s designated location.
Product revenues
The Company distributes its products principally through its customers or sells directly to sites of care. When the product is distributed through customers, the customers subsequently resell the products to patients and health care providers. The Company provides right of return to the customers only in cases of shipping error or product defect and other limited rights. Product revenues are recognized when the customers take control of the products, which typically occurs upon delivery or shipment. For information related to revenues by product type and region, please read 
Note 7, Product Revenues, Net, Accounts Receivable, Net and Reserves for Product Revenues
 to the consolidated financial statements.

F-
11

Variable Consideration
Product revenues are recorded at the net sales price (transaction price) which includes reserves for variable consideration such as: rebates and chargebacks, distribution fees, prompt pay discounts, patient assistance and return reserves. These reserves, representing the Company’s best estimates of the amount of consideration to which it is entitled based on the terms of the contracts, are based on the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable if no payments are required of the Company or a current liability if a payment is required of the Company. Where appropriate, the estimates reflect the Company’s historical experience, contractual and statutory requirements, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. Actual amounts may differ from the Company’s estimates. If actual results vary, these estimates are adjusted, which could have an effect on revenue in the period of adjustment.
Additional details relating to variable consideration are as follows:
•
Rebates and chargebacks: relating to governmental and commercial rebates and chargebacks. 
o
Governmental rebates, including Medicaid-rebates relate to the Company’s estimated obligations to federal or states under established reimbursement arrangements. The commercial rebates relate to arrangements the Company enters into with payors that provide for privately-negotiated rebates. Rebate reserves are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a liability which is included in accrued expenses. 
o
Chargebacks, including Public Health Services (“PHS”) chargebacks, relate to the Company’s estimated obligations resulting from contractual commitments to sell products to qualified healthcare providers at prices lower than the list prices that the Company charges to wholesalers. The wholesaler charges the Company for the difference between what the wholesaler pays for the products and the ultimate selling price to the qualified healthcare providers. Chargeback reserves are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and accounts receivable. Chargeback amounts are generally determined at the time of resale to the qualified healthcare provider from the wholesaler, and the Company generally issues credits for such amounts within a few weeks of receiving notification of resale from the wholesaler.
•
Distribution fees: relating to fees paid to customers in the distribution channel that provide the Company with inventory management, data and distribution services and are generally accounted for as a reduction of revenue. To the extent that the services received are distinct from the Company’s sale of products to the customers, these payments are accounted for as selling, general and administrative expenses. Reserves for distribution fees result in an increase in a liability if payments are required of the Company or a reduction of accounts receivable if no payments are required of the Company. 
•
Prompt payment discounts: relating to the Company’s estimated obligations for credits to be granted to specialty pharmacies for remitting payment on their purchases within established incentive periods. Reserves for prompt payment discounts are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and accounts receivable.
•
Patient assistance: relating to financial assistance programs provided to qualified patients. Reserves for costs related to patient assistance programs are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a liability which is included in accrued expenses.
•
Return reserves: relating to the limited return rights the Company provides to customers. The Company records product return reserve, if appropriate, as a reduction of revenue at the time product sales are recorded. Several factors are considered in determining whether return reserves are required, including the patient population and the customers’ limited return rights. Because of the pricing, the limited number of patients, and the customers’ limited return rights, most customers only carry a limited inventory. Based on these factors and the fact that the Company has not experienced significant product returns to date, return reserves have been immaterial to date.

Collaboration revenue
The Company’s collaboration revenue is primarily generated from its collaboration arrangement with F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd. (“Roche”). For more information, please read 
Note 3, License and Collaboration Agreements
. At the inception of a collaboration arrangement, the Company first assesses whether the contractual arrangement is within the scope of ASC Topic 808, 
Collaborative Arrangements
 to determine whether the arrangement involves a joint operating activity and involves two (or more) parties that are both active participants in the activity and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activity. Then the Company determines whether the collaboration arrangement in its entirety represents a contract with a customer as defined by ASC 606. If only a portion of the collaboration arrangement is potentially with a customer, the Company applies the

F-
12

distinct good or service unit-of-account guidance in ASC 606 to determine whether there is a unit of account that should be accounted for under ASC 606. For the units of account in the collaboration arrangement that do not represent a vendor-customer relationship, the Company will (i) consider applying other GAAP, including by analogy, or (ii) if there is no appropriate analogy, consistently apply a reasonable and rational accounting policy election.

In general, by analogy to ASC 606, the Company identifies the performance obligations within the collaboration arrangement and identifies and allocates the transaction price the Company expects to receive on a relative standalone selling price basis to each performance obligation. Variable consideration, consisting of development and regulatory milestones, will be included in the transaction price only if the Company expects to receive such consideration and if it is probable that the inclusion of the variable consideration will not result in a significant reversal in the cumulative amount of revenue recognized under the arrangement. Sales-based royalty and milestone payments are excluded from the transaction price the Company expects to receive until the underlying sales occur because the license to the Company’s intellectual property is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties or milestones relate as it is the primary driver of value in its collaboration arrangement.

For the recognition of revenue associated with each performance obligation, if the Company determines ASC 606 is not appropriate to apply by analogy, the Company will apply a reasonable, rational and consistently applied accounting policy election to faithfully depict the transfer of services to the collaboration partner over the estimated performance period. Up-front payments from a collaboration partner are recognized as deferred revenue when received and recognized as revenue over the estimated performance period. Reimbursement payments from a collaboration partner associated with cost-sharing provisions in a collaboration arrangement are recognized as the related expense is incurred and classified as an offset to operating expenses. Revenue from sales-based royalty payments is included as collaboration and other revenues on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Revenue from product supply sold to collaboration partners under a collaboration arrangement via contract manufacturing is included as collaboration and other revenues on the consolidated s
tatements of comprehensive income (loss).
Valuation of Product Options
The Company's collaboration arrangements may contain options which provide the collaboration partner with the right to obtain additional licenses. If an arrangement contains product options, by analogy to ASC 606, the Company evaluates the product options to determine whether they represent material rights, which may include options to acquire additional goods or services for free or at a discount. If the customer options are determined to represent material rights, they are recognized as a separate performance obligation at inception of the arrangement. The Company allocates a portion of the transaction price of the collaboration arrangement to material rights based on the relative standalone selling price. Amounts allocated to material rights are not recognized as revenue until related options are exercised or expire. Key assumptions to determine the standalone selling price of product options in a collaboration arrangement include, but are not limited to, forecasted revenues, development timelines, incremental costs related to the arrangement, discount rates and likelihood of technical and regulatory success.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses consist of costs associated with research activities as well as those with the Company’s product development efforts, conducting pre-clinical trials, clinical trials and manufacturing activities. Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred. Up-front fees and milestones paid to third parties in connection with technologies which have not reached technological feasibility and do not have an alternative future use are expensed when incurred.

Direct research and development expenses associated with the Company’s programs include clinical trial site costs, clinical manufacturing costs, costs incurred for consultants and other external services, such as data management and statistical analysis support and materials and supplies used in support of clinical programs. Indirect costs of the Company’s research and development programs include salaries, stock-based compensation and an allocation of its facility and technology costs.
When third-party service providers’ billing terms do not coincide with the Company’s period-end, the Company is required to make estimates of its obligations to those third parties, including clinical trial and pharmaceutical development costs, contractual services costs and costs for supply of its drug candidates incurred in a given accounting period, and record accruals at the end of the period. The Company bases its estimates on its knowledge of the research and development programs, services performed for the period, past history for related activities and the expected duration of the third-party service contract, where applicable.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and related costs for personnel in the Company's executive, finance, legal, information technology, business development, human resources, commercial and other general and administrative functions. Other general and administrative expenses include an allocation of the Company's facility- and technology-related costs and professional fees for legal, consulting and accounting services.

F-
13

Advertising costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses and are expensed as incurred. The Company considers advertising costs as expenses related to the promotion of the Company's commercial products. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, advertising costs totaled $
32.0
 million, $
28.6
 million and $
14.6
 million, respectively.
Stock-Based Compensatio
n
The Company’s stock-based compensation programs include stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), RSU shares with performance conditions (“PSUs”) and an employee stock purchase program (“ESPP”). Stock-based compensation is recognized based on grant date fair value of stock awards.
The fair value of stock options are estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The fair values of PSUs and RSUs are based on the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant. The fair value of stock awards, with consideration given to estimated forfeitures, is recognized as stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period of the grants. The Company estimates forfeitures over the requisite service period using historical forfeiture activity. For stock awards with performance-vesting conditions, the Company does not recognize compensation expense until it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved.
Additionally, the Company granted its CEO options with service and market conditions. A market condition relates to the achievement of a specified price of the Company’s common stock, a specified amount of intrinsic value indexed to the Company’s common stock or a specified price of the Company’s common stock in terms of other similar equity shares. The grant date fair value for the options with service and market conditions is determined by a lattice model with Monte Carlo simulations and is recognized as stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the respective derived service period.
Under the Company’s ESPP, participating employees purchase common stock through payroll deductions. The purchase price is equal to 
85
% of the lower of the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the first business day and the last business day of the relevant purchase period. The fair value of stock purchase rights is estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The fair value of the look-back provision with the 
15
% discount is recognized on a graded-vesting basis as stock-based compensation expense over the offering period.
Income Taxes
The Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the net deferred tax asset to zero when it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will not be realized.

The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon an examination. The amount of the benefit that may be recognized in the financial statements is the largest amount that has a greater than 
50
% likelihood of being realized. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within income tax expense.
It is the intention of the Company to reinvest the earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries in those operations and not to repatriate the earnings to the U.S. Accordingly, the Company does not provide for deferred taxes on the excess of the financial reporting over the tax basis in its investments in foreign subsidiaries as they are considered permanent in duration.

Effective December 31, 2021, the Company adopted a policy to account for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) as a period cost under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. In 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) released a framework for the fundamental reform of international tax rules. The framework provides for two primary “Pillars”; however, only Pillar Two, which provides for a global minimum corporate tax rate of 
15
%, is expected to be applicable to the Company (Pillar One is not expected to be applicable as the Company does not currently meet the turnover threshold - EUR 
20
 billion). In December 2022, Pillar Two was adopted by the Council of the European Union (the “EU”) for implementation by EU member states by December 31, 2023, with effect for tax years beginning in calendar year 2024. The OECD, and its member countries, continue to release new guidance on these rules and the Company is continuously evaluating the impact to its financial position. Currently, the global enactment of Pillar Two did not materially impact the Company's effective tax rate or cash flows. However, the Company will continue to monitor and evaluate new legislation and guidance, which could change its current assessment.

F-
14

Leases
At the inception of an arrangement, the Company determines whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the unique facts and circumstances present in the arrangement. Leases with a term greater than 12 months are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as ROU assets and short-term and long-term lease liabilities, as applicable. The Company has elected not to recognize leases with terms of 12 months or less on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company typically only includes an initial lease term in its assessment of a lease arrangement. Options to renew a lease are not included in the Company’s assessment unless there is reasonable certainty that the Company will renew. The Company monitors its plans to renew its leases quarterly or on an as-needed basis. In addition, the Company’s lease agreements generally do not contain any residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.
Operating lease liabilities and their corresponding ROU assets are recorded based on the present value of future lease payments over the expected remaining lease term at lease commencement. The initial measurement of the lease liability is determined based on the future lease payments, which may include lease payments that depend on an index or a rate (such as the consumer price index or other market index). The Company initially measures payments based on an index or rate by using the applicable rate at lease commencement and subsequent changes in such rates are recognized as variable lease costs. Variable payments that do not depend on a rate or index are not included in the lease liability and are recognized as they are incurred. Lease costs for operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as an operating expense with unrecognized variable lease payments recognized as incurred. Certain adjustments to the ROU asset may be required for items such as lease prepayments or incentives received. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable. As a result, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate, which reflects the fixed rate at which the Company could borrow on a collateralized basis the amount of the lease payments in the same currency, for a similar term, in a similar economic environment. Components of a lease are bifurcated between lease components and non-lease components. The fixed and in-substance fixed contract consideration identified is then allocated based on the relative standalone price to the lease and non-lease components. The Company adopted a practical expedient provided by ASC Topic 842, 
Leases
,

and elected to account for the lease and non-lease components together for existing classes of underlying assets and allocates the contract consideration to the lease component only. In contrast, the Company does not apply the practical expedient for leases embedded in manufacturing and supply agreements with certain of its contract manufacturing organizations and has instead allocated contract consideration between the lease and non-lease components based on their relative standalone price.

Earnings (Loss) per Share
Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the treasury stock method for stock awards and if-converted method for convertible notes by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding. Potential common equivalent shares are excluded if their effect is anti-dilutive
.

Embedded Derivatives
The Company evaluates certain of its financial and business development transactions to determine if embedded components of these contracts meet the definition of derivative under ASC 815. In general, embedded derivatives are required to be bifurcated from the host instrument if (i) the embedded feature is not clearly and closely related to the host contract and (ii) the embedded feature, if considered a freestanding instrument, meets the definition of a derivative. The embedded derivative is reported on the consolidated balance sheets at its fair value. Any change in fair value, as determined at each period, is recorded as a component of the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).

Contingent Consideration
Certain of the Company’s license and collaboration agreements include future payments that are contingent upon the receipt, or receipt and subsequent sale, of a Priority Review Voucher (“PRV”)
. The Company has concluded that these contingent payments represent embedded derivatives. The Company records a liability for such contingent payments at fair value on the date the agreements are effective. The Company estimates the fair value of contingent consideration derivatives through a valuation model that includes an income approach based on the probability-weighted expected cash flows that incorporated industry-based probability-adjusted assumptions relating to the achievement of the milestone and thus the likelihood of making the payments. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration derivatives can result from changes to one or multiple assumptions, including adjustments to the discount rates, the assumed development timeline and the probability of achievement of certain regulatory milestones. At least quarterly, or upon a material change to one or more of the assumptions discussed above, the Company assesses its contingent consideration derivatives and revalues them as necessary. If a revaluation occurs, changes in the fair value of the Company’s contingent consideration derivatives are recognized in the Company’s consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Such changes are classified as other income (loss), net, which corresponds to the classification of any gain recognized upon the actual sale of a PRV.

F-
15

Commitments and Contingencies
The Company records liabilities for legal and other contingencies when information available to the Company indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Legal costs in connection with legal and other contingencies are expensed as costs are incurred
 as selling, general and administrative expenses.

On November 25, 2024, the Company entered into an exclusive global licensing and collaboration agreement and a stock purchase agreement (collectively, the “Arrowhead Agreement”) with Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Arrowhead”), providing the Company with exclusive global rights to multiple clinical, preclinical and discovery-stage programs for rare, genetic diseases of the muscle, CNS and the lungs.
The closing of the transaction was subject to the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and other customary conditions. The agreement became effective as of February 7, 2025 (the “Effective Date”).
When the Arrowhead Agreement became effective, the Company paid Arrowhead an up-front payment of $
500.0
 million and invested $
325.0
 million in Arrowhead's 
common stock at a premium to the valuation on the closing date. As of the date of this report, the Company expects to record between approximately $
500.0
 million to $
600.0
 million in research and development expense for the three months ended March 31, 2025, related to those two payments to Arrowhead. Ad
ditionally, the Company will pay Arrowhead a total of $
250.0
 million in annual installments of $
50.0
 million over 
five years
, with the first payment due on the first anniversary of the Effective Date. T
he Company may be obligated to make payments to Arrowhead totaling up to $
10.3
 billion upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and sales milestones, inclusive of 
$
300.0
 million 
in near-term payments associated with the continued

F-
16

enrollment 
of certain cohorts of a Phase 1/2 study
. Furthermore, upon commercialization, the Company will be required to make tiered royalty payments based on net sales.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, there was no accounting impact as a result of the execution of the Arrowhead Agreement because the closing of the transaction did not occur until subsequent to year-end.

F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd.
On December 21, 2019, the Company entered into a license, collaboration and option agreement with Roche and a stock purchase agreement (collectively, the “Roche Agreement”) with Roche, providing Roche with exclusive commercial rights to ELEVIDYS outside the U.S. The Company retains all rights to ELEVIDYS in the U.S. and will perform all development activities within the joint global development plan necessary to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for ELEVIDYS in the U.S. and the EU, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. Further: (i) research and development expenses incurred under the joint global development plan will be equally shared between the Company and Roche, (ii) Roche is solely responsible for all costs incurred in connection with any development activities (other than those within the joint global development plan) that are necessary to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals outside the U.S, and (iii) the Company will continue to be responsible for the manufacturing of clinical and commercial supplies of ELEVIDYS. The Company has also granted Roche options to acquire ex-U.S. rights to certain future Duchenne-specific programs (the “Options”) in exchange for separate option exercise payments, milestone and royalty considerations, and cost-sharing provisions. The agreement became effective on February 4, 2020. The Roche Agreement is governed by a joint steering committee (“JSC”) formed by representatives from Roche and the Company. The JSC, among other activities, manages the overall strategic alignment between the parties, approves any material update to the joint global development plan and budget and oversees the operations of the subcommittees.

The Company received an aggregate of approximately $
1.2
 billion in cash consideration from Roche, consisting of an up-front payment and an equity investment in the Company. 
The Company may receive up to $
1.7
 billion in development, regulatory and sales milestones related to 
ELEVIDYS. The Company receives tiered royalty payments on net sales of ELEVIDYS outside of the U.S. based on the average cost to manufacture ELEVIDYS
. Of the $1.2 billion up-front cash received from Roche, (i) $
312.1
 million, net of issuance costs, was allocated to the approximately 
2.5
 million shares of the Company’s common stock issued to Roche based on the closing price when the shares were issued, (ii) $
485.0
 million was allocated to the Options, and (iii) $
348.7
 million was allocated to a single, combined performance obligation (“Combined Performance Obligation”) comprised of: (i) the license of IP relating to 
ELEVIDYS transferred to Roche, (ii) the related research and development services provided under the joint global development plan, (iii) the services provided to manufacture clinical supplies of ELEVIDYS, and (iv) the Company’s participation in the JSC, because the Company determined that the license of IP and related activities were not capable of being distinct from one another.

The value assigned to the Options is reflected as deferred revenue and will not be recognized until an option is either: (i) exercised by Roche, or (ii) expires. If exercised, the value will be aggregated with the option exercise price and recognized over the applicable performance period. If expired, the value will be recognized immediately. The Company recognizes revenue related to the Combined Performance Obligation on a straight-line basis over the expected performance period of the joint global development plan, which extended through the fourth quarter of 2023. Revenue relating to future development, regulatory and sales milestones will be recognized when the milestone is probable of achievement (which is typically when the milestone has occurred). Any royalties payable by Roche will be recognized in the period earned.
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized $
114.0
 million, $
98.5
 million and $
89.2
 million of collaboration and other revenues, respectively, which primarily consists of collaboration revenue, contract manufacturing revenue and royalty revenue related to the Roche Agreement.
On February 12, 2024, Roche declined to exercise a certain Option related to one external, early-stage development program, which resulted in that Option's expiry and the immediate recognition of the value assigned to that Option as collaboration revenue. As such, the Company recognized $
48.0
 million of collaboration revenue during the year ended 
December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had total deferred revenue of $
455.3
 million and $
487.4
 million, respectively, which is primarily as
sociated with the Roche Agreement, of which $
130.3
 million and $
50.4
 million was classified as current
. 
On February 5, 2025, an option for a certain program expired, which resulted in the immediate recognition of the value assigned to that option, $
112.0
 million, as collaboration revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2025. As of December 31, 2024, the amount is classified as deferred revenue, current portion, on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.

For both the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized $
89.2
 million of collaboration revenue, which relates to the amortization of the Combined Performance Obligation. The fair value allocated to Combined Performance Obligation was fully amortized as of 
December 31, 2023.

In accordance with the Roche Agreement, the parties agreed to enter into a supply agreement with Roche in order to supply them with clinical and commercial batches of ELEVIDYS (the “Supply Agreement”). Roche utilizes the supply for sales of ELEVIDYS in territories outside of the U.S where Roche has received certain approvals for ELEVIDYS. The Company is eligible to receive royalties on these sales. While the Supply Agreement is in the process of being negotiated at the issuance of this annual report, the Company delivered several batches of commercial ELEVIDYS supply to Roche that were agreed upon on a purchase order-by-purchase order basis
. Contract manufacturing revenue and royalty revenue are included in collaboration and other revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). 
The following table summarizes certain Roche activity for 
each of the periods indicated. There was no similar activity for the year ended 2022.

Genethon
The Company entered into a sponsored research agreement in May 2017 and subsequently a license and collaboration agreement with Genethon in November 2019 (the “Genethon Collaboration Agreement”) for Genethon’s micro-dystrophin gene therapy program for the treatment of Duchenne. The Genethon Collaboration Agreement grants the Company with exclusive rights in the majority of the world (primarily excluding the EU) to Genethon’s micro-dystrophin gene therapy products (“Genethon Products”) and other micro-dystrophin gene therapy products.
Upon signing the Genethon Collaboration Agreement, the Company made an up-front payment of $
28.0
 million, which was recorded as research and development expense in the Company’s consolidated statements of comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2019. Additionally, for the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded $
6.8
 million, $
6.6
 million and $
3.5
 million, respectively, of r
esearch and development expense related to reimbursable development costs incurred by Genethon for Genethon Products. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, there were 
no
 development or 
regulatory milestones deemed probable of being achieved and, accordingly, no additional expense has been recognized.
During May 2024, the Company and Genethon agreed to terminate the Genethon Collaboration Agreement, effective June 2024. This resulted in the elimination of all future shared development costs and future development, regulatory and sales milestone obligations.
Myonexus Therapeutics Inc.
In April 2019, the Company completed its acquisition of Myonexus Therapeutics, Inc. (“Myonexus”), a clinical-stage gene therapy biotechnology company that was developing gene therapies for LGMD for $
178.3
 million. The Company may also be required to make up to $
200.0
 million in additional payments to selling shareholders of Myonexus based on the achievement of certain sales-and regulatory- related milestones. The acquisition was accounted for as an asset acquisition as substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a group of similar identifiable assets (the five LGMD gene therapy programs). As part of the consideration for the transaction, the Company is required to make contingent payments to the selling shareholders of Myonexus upon the receipt and subsequent sale of a PRV with respect to a Myonexus product. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the contingent consideration liability was $
47.1
 million and $
37.7
 million, respectively. The changes in fair value are recorded within other income (expense), net, in the Company’s consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Please read

 million of which related to the regulatory approval of ELEVIDYS, and the remaining related to sales-based milestones as the Company determined that all sales-based milestones were achieved or were probable of being achieved. As of 
December 31, 2024, the in-licensed right asset with a net carrying value of 
$
20.6
 million is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the relevant patent. Royalty payments due to Nationwide associated with commercial sales of ELEVIDYS totaled $
30.6

The Company’s assets with a fair value categorized as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy include money market funds and the Company's strategic investment in a biotechnology company listed on the Nasdaq Global Market (the “Nasdaq”). The Company's $
2.7
 million strategic investment is included in other non-current assets in the Company's consolidated balance sheets, with changes in fair value being recorded withi
n other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).

The Company's assets with a fair value categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy consist of commercial paper, government and government agency bonds, corporate bonds and certificates of deposit. The Company's commercial paper, government and government agency bonds, corporate bonds and certificates of deposit have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued at the end of each reporting period utilizing third-party pricing services. The Company uses observable market inputs to determine value, which primarily consist of reportable trades. Certain short-term investments with maturities of less than three months at the date of acquisition are presented as cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

The Company’s assets with a fair value categorized as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy consist of a strategic investment in a private biotechnology company whose fair value measurement was based upon significant inputs not observable in the market and therefore represented a Level 3 measurement.
The Company’s contingent consideration liability with a fair value categorized as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy relates to the regulatory-related contingent payments to Myonexus selling shareholders as well as to an academic institution under a separate license agreement that meets the definition of a derivative. For more information related to Myonexus, please read 
Note 3, License and Collaboration Agreements
. The contingent consideration liability was estimated using an income approach based on the probability-weighted expected cash flows that incorporated industry-based probability adjusted assumptions relating to the achievement of the milestone and thus the likelihood of making the payments. This fair value measurement was based upon significant inputs not observable in the market and therefore represented a Level 3 measurement. Significant changes, which increase or decrease the probabilities of achieving the milestone or shorten or lengthen the time required to achieve the milestone, would result in a corresponding increase or decrease in the fair value of the liability. At the end of each reporting period, the fair value is adjusted to reflect the most current assumptions through earnings.
The Company assesses its financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis and transfers its financial assets between the relevant fair value hierarchies at the end of each reporting period, as needed. There were no transfers into or out of Level 3 during the year ended December 31, 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company's strategic investment in a formerly private biotechnology company transferred into Level 1 from Level 3 as a result of the biotechnology company's listing on the Nasdaq.

At the end of each reporting period, the fair value of the Company's strategic investments that are not publicly traded securities are adjusted if the issuers issue similar or identical securities or when there is a triggering event for impairment. There were no valuation measurement events related to the fair value of the Company's Level 3 strategic investments during the year ended December 31, 2024
, as no impairment indicators were identified nor were similar securities issued. 
During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company impaired its investment in Series A preferred stock of Lacerta Therapeutics, Inc. (“Lacerta”) after comparing the fair value of the Lacerta strategic investment to its carrying value, resulting in an impairment loss of $
30.0
 million. The Company's assessment considered entity-specific impairment indicators, such as the future business prospects of Lacerta's existing programs and expected future cash flows. The fair value as of December 31, 2023 was estimated based on the expectation that the Company would realize no future cash flows associated with its investment in Lacerta. The impairment loss is included in other income (expense), net within the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). During the year ended December 31, 2022
, the company recorded impairment losses of $
2.6
 million related to its strategic investments.

A net increase of $

 million and $

 million were recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss) during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, to account for the change in fair value and termination of liabilities of the Company's existing contingent consideration liabilities. These changes were a result of updates made to certain inputs and assumptions impacting the probability-weighted expected cash flows, principally the probability of success of the underlying programs and the discount rate utilized to determine the present value of future payments to be made, partially offset by the termination of a license agreement with an academic institution that included an embedded derivative during both years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the remaining contingent consideration was recorded as a non-current liability on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.
The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, net and accounts payable approximated fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments. For fair value information related to the Company’s debt facilities, please read

2027 Convertible Notes and Related Transactions
     Issuance and Capped Call Transactions
In September 2022, the Company issued $
1,150.0
 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due on 
September 15, 2027
. The 2027 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and bear interest at a rate of 
1.25
% per annum, payable 
semi-annually
 in cash on each March 15 and September 15, commencing on March 15, 2023. The net proceeds were $
1,126.7
 million after deducting the discounts and offering expenses of $
23.3
 million, which is amortized under the effective interest method and recorded as additional interest expense over the life of the 2027 Notes. The effective interest rate on the 2027 Notes is 
1.67
%. 
The aggregate issuance of the 2027 Notes includes the issuance of $
20.0
 million in aggregate principal amount of 2027 Notes to the Michael A. Chambers Living Trust, an entity affiliated with Michael Chambers, a member of the Company’s board of directors.

The 2027 Notes may be convertible into 
8,100,485
 shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion rate of 
7.0439
 shares per $
1,000
 principal amount of the 2027 Notes, or a conversion price of $
141.97
 per share. Upon conversion, at its discretion, the Company may pay cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and stock. 
Prior to March 15, 2027, the holders of the 2027 Notes may convert their 2027 Notes at their option upon achievement of certain market conditions or occurrence of certain corporate events.

Only on or after September 20, 2025, should certain market conditions be met, the Company may redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2027 Notes at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the 2027 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Holders of the 2027 Notes have the right to require the Company to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their notes at 100% of its respective principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture agreement for the 2027 Notes. The 2027 Notes contain customary covenants and events of default, occurrence of which permits the holders to accelerate all outstanding obligations, including principal and interest.

In connection with the issuance of the 2027 Notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with counterparties intended to minimize the impact of potential dilution upon conversion of the 2027 Notes (the “2022 Capped Calls”), which covers 
8,100,485
 shares of the Company’s common stock. The 2022 Capped Calls have an initial strike price of approximately $
141.97
 per share and a cap price of approximately $
210.32
 per 
share. If, upon conversion of the 2027 Notes, the price of the Company’s common stock is between the strike price and the cap price of the capped calls, the counterparties will deliver shares of the Company’s common stock and/or cash with an aggregate value equal to the difference between the price of the Company’s common

F-
27

stock 
at the conversion date and the strike price, multiplied by the number of shares of the Company’s common stock related to the capped calls being exercised. The Company paid $
127.3
 million for the 2022 Capped Calls.

Termination of 2019 Term Loan
On September 16, 2022, using proceeds received from the issuance of the 2027 Notes described above, the Company prepaid in full all of its amounts outstanding with respect to the December 2019 term loan with Biopharma Credit PLC and Biopharma Credit Investments V (Master) LP (the “December 2019 Term Loan”) and repaid in full all obligations due. The aggregate payoff amount was approximately $
585.5
 million, which includes $
550.0
 million of principal, additional loan consideration and premiums of $
25.4
 million, and accrued interest of $
10.1
 million through the repayment date. The loss on debt extinguishment was $
26.9
 million, and was included in the loss on debt extinguishment in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2022.
2024 Convertible Notes and Related Transactions
     Issuance and Capped Call Transactions
In November 2017, the Company issued $
570.0
 million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible notes due on November 15, 2024. The 2024 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and bear interest at a rate of 
1.50
% per annum, payable semi-annually in cash on each May 15 and November 15, commencing on May 15, 2018. The net proceeds were $
559.4
 million after deducting the discounts and offering expenses of $
10.6
 million, which is amortized under the effective interest method and recorded as additional interest expense over the life of the 2024 Notes. The effective interest rate on the 2024 Notes is 
1.9
%.

The 2024 Notes could be convertible into 
7,763,970
 shares of the Company’s common stock under certain circumstances prior to maturity at a conversion rate of 
13.621
 shares per $
1,000
 principal amount of the 2024 Notes, or a conversion price of $
73.42
 per share, subject to adjustment under certain conditions. Upon conversion, the Company could pay cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and stock, as determined by the Company at its discretion. The holders of the 2024 Notes could convert their 2024 Notes at their option upon achievement of certain market conditions or occurrence of certain corporate events.

The 2024 Notes were not redeemable by the Company prior to the maturity date. Holders of the 2024 Notes, however, had the right to require the Company to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their notes at 
100
% of its respective principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture agreement for the 2024 Notes. The 2024 Notes contained customary covenants and events of default, occurrence of which permitted the holders to accelerate all outstanding obligations, including principal and interest.

In connection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with counterparties intended to minimize the impact of potential dilution upon conversion of the 2024 Notes (the “2017 Capped Calls”) which covers 
7,763,970
 shares of the Company’s common stock. The 2017 Capped Calls had an initial strike price of approximately $
73.42
 per share and a cap price of approximately $
104.88
 per share. If, upon conversion of the 2024 Notes, the price of the Company’s common stock was between the strike price and the cap price of the capped calls, the counterparties would deliver shares of the Company’s common stock and/or cash with an aggregate value equal to the difference between the price of the Company’s common stock at the conversion date and the strike price, multiplied by the number of shares of the Company’s common stock related to the capped calls being exercised. The Company paid $
50.9
 million for the 2017 Capped Calls.

Repurchase and Capped Call Settlement

In September 2022, in connection with the issuance of the 2027 Notes, the Company entered into separate, privately negotiated transactions to repurchase a portion of the outstanding 2024 Notes (the “Repurchase”). The holders exchanged $
150.6
 million in aggregate principal value of 2024 Notes held by them for an aggregate payment of $
248.6
 million for full settlemen
t of the principal value and accrued interest on such date
. The repurchase was not pursuant to the conversion privileges included in the terms of the debt at issuance and therefore was accounted for as a debt extinguishment. Accordingly, on the repurchase date, the Company recorded $
98.5
 million of debt extinguishment expense which was included in the loss on debt extinguishment within the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2022. Corresponding to the Repurchase, the related 2017 Capped Calls were terminated. As a result, the Company received $
26.3
 million in cash.
         Exchange and Capped Call Settlement
In March 2023, the Company entered into separate, privately negotiated exchange agreements with certain holders of the outstanding 2024 Notes (the “Exchange”), which resulted in an exchange of $
313.5
 million in aggregate principal value of the 2024 Notes for shares of the Company’s common stock. In connection with the Exchange, the Company issued approximately 
4.5
 million shares of the Company's common stock with a fair value of approximately $
693.4
 million. The Company also incurred approximately $
6.9
 million in third-party debt conversion costs. The exchange was not pursuant to the conversion privileges included in the terms of the debt at issuance and therefore was accounted for as a debt extinguishment and resulted in a loss on debt extinguishment of $
387.3
 million, inclusive of the $
6.9
 million 
in third-party debt conversion costs, which was included in the consolidated statements of

F-
28

comprehensive 
income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2023. Corresponding to the Exchange, the related 2017 Capped Calls were terminated. As a result, the Company received $
80.6
 million in cash.
        Conversion and Capped Call Settlement in 2024
Upon maturity as of November 15, 2024 (“the Maturity Date”), the Company converted the remaining outstanding 
bonds into approximately 
1.2
 million s
hares of its common stock equivalent to an aggregate principal amount of $
91.6
 million. A de minimis number of bonds were not converted and, as a result, the Company paid less than $
0.1
 million in cash to those bondholders. As the conversions were completed under the original terms of the 2024 Notes, there is no gain or loss impact on the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).
In May 2024, the Company informed holders of the 2024 Notes of its election to settle the 2024 Notes in shares, which, pursuant to the terms of the 2017 Capped Call agreements, would require the Company to settle the 2017 Capped Calls in shares. On September 16, 2024 (the “Effective Date”), the Company entered into supplements with each of the counterparties to modify the terms of each of the 2017 Capped Calls to require settlement in cash rather than in shares. As a result of the modification, the Company reclassified the fair value of the 2017 Capped Calls of $
43.9
 million on the Effective Date from stockholders’ equity to derivative assets. As a result of the conversion, the Company ultimately received $
45.3
 million in cash to settle the remaining 2017 Capped Calls on November 15, 2024. The change in the fair value of the derivative assets from the Effective Date to Maturity Date was a gain of $
1.5
 m
illion and recorded to other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). There were 
no
 derivative assets remaining as of December 31, 2024.
Total Debt Obligations
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded approximately $
1,137.1
 million and $
1,238.0
 million as debt on the consolidated balance sheets, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the Company reclassified the balance of the 2024 Notes from long-term debt to current liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets, as the 2024 Notes matured in less than twelve months. As of 
December 31, 2024, all debt was long-term in nature.

14. EQUITY

In November 2024, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program (the “2024 Repurchase Program”) of up to $
500.0
 million of the Company’s outstanding common stock over the next 18 months. Correspondingly, the Company entered into a Rule 10b-18 repurchase plan that allows it to conduct open market repurchases periodically up to the remaining authorization under the 2024 Repurchase Program. There were 
no
 share repurchases of our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2024.
Repurchased shares are held as treasury stock. The amount paid to repurchase shares will be recorded as a reduction to stockholders’ equity. As treasury stock is not considered shares outstanding, it will be excluded from average common stock outstanding for both basic and diluted earnings per share.

15. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
In June 2013, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “2013 ESPP”) which authorized 
0.3
 million shares of common stock available to be iss
ued. In June 2016, 2019 and 2023, the Company’s stockholders approved an additional 
0.3
 million, 
0.5
 million and 
0.3
 million shares, respectively, of common stock available for issuance under the 2013 ESPP.
 As of December 31, 2024, 
0.2
 million shares of common stock remain available for future grant under the 2013 ESPP.
In June 2018, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2018 Plan”). The 2018 Plan, which authorized 
2.9
 million shares of common stock to be issued, allows for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock awards (“RSAs”)
, RSUs, performance shares and performan
ce units. In June 2020, June 2022 and June 2023, an additional 
3.8
 million, 
2.5
 million and 
2.5
 million shares of common stock, respectively, were approved by the Company’s stockholders and added to the 2018 Plan. As of 
December 31, 2024, together with the roll-over shares from the Company’s 2011 Equity Incentive Plan, 
3.4
 million shares of common stock remain available for future grant under the 2018 Plan.
In March 2024, the Company initiated the 2024 Employment Commencement Incentive Plan (the “2024 Plan”). The 2024 Plan, which authorized 0
.6
 million shares of common stock to be issued, allows for the grant of stock options, SARs, RSAs, RSUs, performance shares and performance units. In June 2024, 
there was
 an addition of 
0.5
 million shares to the 2024 Plan. 
As of December 31, 2024, 
1.0
 million shares of common stock remain available for future grant under the 2024 Plan.

Stock Options
In general, stock options have a 
ten-year
 term and vest over a 
four-year
 period, with one-fourth of the underlying shares vesting on the first anniversary of the grant and 1/48th of the underlying shares vesting monthly thereafter, such that the underlying shares will be fully vested on the fourth anniversary of the grant, subject to the terms of the applicable plan under which they were granted.
The fair values of stock options granted during the periods presented are measured on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, with the following assumptions:

(1)
The risk-free interest rate is estimated using an average of Treasury bill interest rates over a historical period commensurate with the expected term of the option that correlates to the prevailing interest rates at the time of grant.
(2)
The expected dividend yield is 
zero
 as the Company has not paid any dividends to date and does not expect to pay dividends in the future.
(3)
The expected term is estimated using historical exercise behavior.

(4)
The expected volatility is the implied volatility in exchange-traded options of the Company’s common stock. 
The amounts estimated according to the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model may not be indicative of the actual values realized upon the exercise of these options by the holders.

Grant Modification
 In June 2017, the Company granted its CEO 
3,300,000
 options with service and market conditions which were subject to a five-year cliff vesting schedule. On April 19, 2022 (the “Effective Date”), the Company entered into an agreement with its CEO to modify the vesting conditions of the options 
(the “Amendment”). Under the Amendment, one-third of the options vested (the “Vested Tranche”) on the Effective Date with no required service or market conditions. Subject to the CEO's continued service through each applicable vesting date and the compound annual growth rate of the Company's common stock exceeding that of the Nasdaq Biotech Index in varying percentages, the remaining two-thirds of the options (the “Unvested Tranche”) shall vest in varying increments at any time between the Effective Date and June 26, 2025 (the “Measurement Period”) when (and if) the average of the closing price of the Company’s common stock during any consecutive 20 trading day period during the Measurement Period reaches certain pre-determined target stock prices. Additionally, the CEO is subject to a one-year post-exercise restriction to sell, transfer or dispose shares acquired upon the exercise of any options that vest after deduction of any shares withheld or sold to pay the applicable aggregate exercise price and/or withholding taxes. The aggregate incremental cost of the modification of the CEO's awards was 
$
123.3
 million.
During both years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, 
respectively, 
550,110
 options relating to the Unvested Tranche became vested as they met the conditions for vesting and, accordingly, all previously unrecognized expense associated with these options was immediately recognized
. For the years ended 
December 31, 2023
 and 2022, the Company recorded $
13.4
 million and $
109.9
 million as stock-based compensation expense relating to the CEO
’s awards, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the Unvested Tranche was fully expensed.
Excluding the options with market and service conditions granted to the Company’s CEO, the remaining stock options granted during the periods presented in the table have only service-based criteria and vest over four years.

Stock options and the remaining RSUs granted during the year ended December 31, 2024 have only service-based criteria and vest over four years.

As of December 31, 2024, the following PSUs became vested or eligible for vesting:
•
March 2022 PSU: The expanded regulatory approval of ELEVIDYS in June 2024 resulted in 
33,000
 shares becoming eligible for vesting, which is contingent on the fulfillment of remaining service conditions.
•
March 2023 PSU: The achievement of a certain financial performance target during the year ended December 31, 2024
 resulted in 
24,500
 shares becoming eligible for vesting, which is contingent on the fulfillment of remaining service conditions.
•
March 2024 PSU: The expanded regulatory approval of ELEVIDYS in June 2024 resulted in the cliff-vesting of 
44,300
 of the 97,460 shares of the March 2024 PSU during the year ended December 31, 2024. 

As of December 31, 2024
, none of the remaining performance conditions associated with the March 2022 PSU and March 2024 PSU were probable of being achieved.
The weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $
151.20

For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminates the option to currently deduct research and development expenses and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize the costs over five years for research activities performed in the United States and 15 years for research activities performed outside the United States. The requirement to capitalize research and development costs for tax purposes resulted in the Company having taxable profits and recording federal and state tax expense of $
5.1
 million and $
19.7
 million, respectively. The state tax expense of $
19.7
 m
illion is primarily related to the temporary suspension of utilizing net operating loss carryforwards in certain states the Company operates in.
On a periodic basis, the Company reassesses the valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets, weighing positive and negative evidence to assess the recoverability of such deferred tax assets. In assessing the Company’s ability to realize its net deferred tax assets, the Company considered various factors, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, potential carryback claims and tax planning strategies to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its net deferred tax assets will not be realized. Based upon these factors, the Company has concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company will not recognize the benefits of its net federal and state deferred tax assets. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance against the U.S. net deferred tax assets is maintained at December 31, 2024 and 2023. The Company continues to monitor its recent earnings history and it is possible that within the next 12 months, there may be sufficient positive evidence to release a portion or all of the Company’s valuation allowance. The release of the valuation allowance, as well as the exact timing and the amount of such release, continue to be subject to, among other things, the Company’s level of profitability, revenue growth, and expectations regarding future profitability. Release of the valuation allowance would result in a benefit to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded, which could have a material impact on net earnings. The total deferred tax asset balance subject to the valuation allowance was approximately $
890.6
 million as of December 31, 2024. The Company will continue to monitor the need for a full or partial valuation allowance on a quarterly basis.

The Company generated foreign deferred tax assets mainly consisting of net operating loss carryforwards, stock-based compensation and unrealized gain/losses. Based upon the income projections in the majority of the foreign jurisdictions, the Company believes it will realize the benefit of its future deductible differences in these jurisdictions. As such, the Company has not recorded a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets in these foreign jurisdictions. Brazil, Germany and the Netherlands have generated deferred tax assets, which consist primarily of net operating loss carryforwards. The Company has concluded that it is more likely than not that it will not recognize the future benefits of the deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions, and accordingly, a full valuation allowance has been recorded against these foreign deferred tax assets.

As of December 31, 2024, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards 
of $
134.9

2025
 and 
2041
. Federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $
65.8
 million and $

under 
Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and similar state laws based on future ownership changes and the value of the Company’s stock. Additionally, the Company has $
40.9

million and $
48.9

million of federal and state research and development credits, respectively, and $
301.9

million of federal orphan drug tax credits available to offset future tax liabilities. 
These federal and state research and development credits expire between 2034 and 2044 and 
between 2031 and 2039, respectively.
 The federal orphan drug credits expire between 2034 and 2044. The Company also has foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $
13.5
 million, mainly derived from the net operating loss generated by its subsidiary in Brazil, which may be carried forward indefinitely.
The Company, or one of its subsidiaries, files income tax returns in the U.S., and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The federal, state and foreign income tax returns are generally subject to tax examinations for the tax years ended December 31, 2021 through December 31, 2024. To the extent the Company has tax attribute carryforwards, the tax years in which the attribute was generated may still be adjusted upon examination by the Internal Revenue Service, state or foreign tax authorities to the extent utilized in a future period.

The balance of total unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2024
, if recognized, would not affect the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations, due to a full valuation allowance against the Company’s U.S. deferred tax assets. The Company does not expect the amount of unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly in the next twelve months. The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. It had 
no
 accrual for interest or penalties on its consolidated balance sheets at 
December 31, 2024 or 2023
. 
No
 interest and/or penalties were recognized in 
2024, 2023, or 2022.
The Company’s intent is to only make distributions from non-U.S. subsidiaries in the future when they can be made at no net tax cost. Otherwise, the Company considers all of its foreign earnings to be permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. and has no plans to repatriate these foreign earnings to the U.S. The Company has no material unremitted earnings from its non-U.S. subsidiaries.

19. LEASES
The Company has real estate operating leases in Cambridge, Andover, Burlington and Bedford, Massachusetts, Dublin and Columbus, Ohio, and Durham, North Carolina that provide for scheduled annual rent increases throughout each lease’s term. The Company has also identified leases embedded in certain of its manufacturing and supply agreements as the Company determined that it controls the use of the facilities and related equipment therein. For more information related to the lease embedded in manufacturing and supply agreements with Catalent, Inc. (“Catalent”), please refer to 
Note 22, Commitments and Contingencies
.

Bedford, Massachusetts
On April 22, 2022, the Company entered into a lease agreement (the “Bedford Lease”) for 
288,000
 square feet of to-be-constructed research and development and manufacturing space in Bedford, Massachusetts. 
The term of the Bedford Lease commences upon the landlord’s completion of the initial construction of the core and shell of the building, at which time the Company will obtain control of the premises and commence internal construction activities. The initial term of the Bedford Lease is anticipated to terminate on December 31, 2038. The Company has two options to extend the lease for a period of 
ten years
 each, exercisable under certain conditions and at a market rate determined in accordance with the lease agreement. 
The lease commenced in May 2023 as the Company obtained control of the premises.
The Bedford Lease provides for a tenant improvement allowance from the landlord of $
72.0
 million 
to be used towards costs incurred by the Company in the design and construction of the premises, which was recorded as a reduction to ROU assets and lease liabilities. In August 2024, the Company entered into an amendment to the Bedford Lease to extend the term in which the tenant

F-
36

improvement 
allowance could be reimbursed from the landlord (the “Bedford Amendment”) through December 2, 2025. The Company also agreed to reimburse the landlord for certain costs incurred in order to fund the extension of the reimbursement period associated with the tenant improvement allowance, totaling $
2.9
 million. The Bedford Amendment was accounted for as a modification to the Bedford Lease.
In May 2022, in connection with the execution of the Bedford Lease, the Company issued a letter of credit collateralized by cash deposits of approximately $
8.4
 million, which was included in other non-current assets of the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Such letter of credit shall be reduced to approximately $
5.6
 million at the commencement of the fourth rent year, provided certain conditions set forth in the Bedford Lease are satisfied.
 Additionally, the Company is responsible for reimbursing the landlord for the Company’s share of the property’s operating expenses and property taxes.

 The Company had a lease liability and ROU asset of $
143.3
 million and $
91.6
 million, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 related to the Bedford Lease. Tenant improvement costs incurred by the Company that had been reimbursed by the landlord totaled $
40.3
 million as of December 31, 2024 and are recorded as an increase to the lease liability within the Company's consolidated balance sheets.

Columbus, Ohio
In December 2018, the Company entered into a lease agreement for a research and development facility in Columbus, Ohio, which was subsequently amended in May 2022 (the “Columbus Amendment,” together with the Columbus Amendment, the lease agreement is referred to as the “Columbus Lease”). The Columbus Lease
 expands from its current form of approximately 
78,000
 square feet to 
167,000
 square feet through a series of expansion spaces commencing at various periods through January 1, 2025.
Each expansion space commences on the date when the landlord will deliver control of that space for the Company to carry out design and construction activities (the “Columbus Commencement Date”). The Company is obligated to pay rent on each expansion space nine months after the Columbus Commencement Date. The Columbus Lease expires on December 31, 2036, and the Company has options to extend the lease by 
five years
 in both 2036 and 2041. Each option is exercisable under certain conditions and at a market rate determined in accordance with the lease agreement.
The Company commenced design and construction activities on areas of the premises of approximately 
18,000
 square feet (the “Second Expansion Space”)
, 
36,000
 square feet (the “Initial Expansion Space”) and 
19,000
 square feet (the “Third Expansion Space”) on June 1, 2022, October 1, 2022 and September 1, 2023, respectively. As a result,
 it was determined that the lease related to the Second Expansion Space, the Initial Expansion Space and the Third Expansion Space had commenced on those three dates, respectively. The total ROU asset and lease liability associated with the Columbus Lease, inclusive of the Third Expansion Space, the Second Expansion Space and the Initial Expansion Space, was $
11.1
 million and $
19.3
 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2024.
Lease Obligations
As of December 31, 2024, ROU assets for operating leases were $
148.3
 million and operating lease liabilities were $
205.7
 million.

20. EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE
Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the treasury stock method for stock awards and the if-converted method for convertible debt by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding. Given that the Company recorded a net loss for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, there is no difference between basic and diluted net loss per share since the effect of common stock equivalents would be anti-dilutive and are, therefore, excluded from the diluted net loss per share calculation.
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per common share:

.

Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.

The Company entered into a development, commercial manufacturing, and supply agreement as related to the Company's adherent manufacturing process for its gene therapy programs in June 2018 and, subsequently, entered into the first, second and third amendments in May 2019, July 2020 and October 2021, respectively, with Brammer Bio MA, LLC, an affiliate of Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. (“Thermo”) (collectively, the “Thermo Agreement”).
In October 2021, the Company executed a third amendment (the “Third Amendment”) that modified the terms of the Thermo Agreements, which significantly decreased the Company’s right of use of the facility’s capacity and reduced the fixed and in-substance fixed payments due over the remaining term of the agreement. Under the Third Amendment
, the Company has committed to guaranteed purchases under the Third Amendment on a take-or-pay basis regardless of whether services or goods are ordered. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company did not satisfy the total annual guaranteed purchase requirements and, as a result, recognized a loss of approximately $
54.0
 million, which was classified as research and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2022, with the outstanding liability reflected as accrued contract manufacturing costs within accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022. 
No
 similar losses were incurred during the years ended 
December 31, 2023 or 2024.
In March 2023, the Company executed a fourth amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) that modified the terms of the Thermo Agreement. The Fourth Amendment removed the previous minimum batch purchase commitment and associated fee for the remaining term of the Thermo Agreement, and instead implemented a fee of up to $
60.0
 million, to be paid in three installments of $
20.0
 million each by March 1, 2024, December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2025, respectively. During the year ended 
December 31, 2024
, the Company paid the first $
20.0
 million installment due 
March 1, 2024
, considered a nonrefundable advance payment.
On July 18, 2024, the Company issued a termination notice to Thermo to terminate the Thermo Agreement. The termination was effective as of August 21, 2024. The aggregate net impact of the termination was $
55.4
 million of research and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). As the Company had yet to obtain regulatory approval to produce commercial supply of ELEVIDYS at Thermo manufacturing facilities, the Company recorded the charges incurred as research and development expenses during the year ended 
December 31, 2024
. Included in the net impact noted above are non-cash charges due to the termination of $
62.7
 million, related to the remaining unamortized nonrefundable advance payments. Additionally, there were unbilled service and material costs ordered by the Company as of the termination date of $
29.2
 million that were expensed as research and development expense during the year ended 
December 31, 2024
. As related to the termination, costs reimbursable by Roche under the Roche Agreement and reflected as a reduction to research and development expenses were $
36.5
 million.

Catalent, Inc.
The Company entered into a manufacturing collaboration agreement and, subsequently, a manufacturing and supply agreement with Catalent, formerly Paragon Biosciences, Inc. in October 2018 and February 2019, respectively (collectively, the “Catalent Agreements”). Pursuant to the terms of the Catalent Agreements, Catalent agreed to provide the Company with 
two
 dedicated clean room suites and an option to reserve 
two
 additional clean room suites for its gene therapy programs, subject to certain minimum and maximum volume limitations. In September 2019, the Company exercised the option to gain access to the two additional clean room suites. 
The Company determined that the Catalent Agreements contained a lease because the Company had the right to direct the use of the facility and related equipment therein. The lease on all 
four
 dedicated clean room suites at Catalent commenced during 2020, which is when the dedicated clean room suites became available for use by the Company. 
In March 2021, the Company modified the terms of the Catalent Agreements, which decreased the Company’s right of use of certain dedicated clean room suites. As of December 31, 2024, the Company controls two clean room suites.

F-
41

In November 2022, the Company modified certain terms of the Catalent Agreements which extended the term of the agreement through December 31, 2028, which represented a modification of the existing embedded lease over certain clean room suites. The modification resulted in the recognition of additional ROU assets and lease liabilities of $
19.2
 million, as well as reclassification of $
3.9
 million between long-term and short-term manufacturing deposits. The modification also removed
 certain fixed payments due over the remaining term of the agreement. Further, in order to maintain the Company's dedicated clean room suites, it has committed to guaranteed purchases under the Amendment on a take-or-pay basis regardless of whether services or goods are ordered. The Company has the ability to terminate the Catalent Agreements prior to expiration, subject to the payment of additional financial consideration. As of December 31, 2024, the Company believes it is probable that the guaranteed purchase requirements will be met in the normal course of business throughout the term of the Catalent Agreements.

Aldevron, LLC
The Company entered into a clinical and commercial supply agreement in December 2018, as subsequently amended in June 2020, with Aldevron LLC (“Aldevron”) for the supply of plasmid DNA to fulfill its needs for gene therapy clinical trials and commercial supply (collectively, the “Aldevron Agreements”). Pursuant to the terms of the Aldevron Agreements, Aldevron agreed to reserve a certain amount of manufacturing capacity on a quarterly basis. In return, the Company is required to make advance payments to Aldevron related to the manufacturing capacity. The term of the Aldevron Agreements will expire on 
December 31, 2026
. 
The Company has the option to extend the term of the Aldevron Agreements by one year if the Company delivers a written notice of its intention to extend to Aldevron no later than June 1, 2025. 
In January 2025, the Company modified certain terms of the Aldevron Agreements which extended the term of the agreement through December 31, 2028 (the “Aldevron Amendment”). As a result of the Aldevron Amendment, the Company has the option to extend the term of the Aldevron Agreements by one year if the Company delivers a written notice of its intention to extend to Aldevron no later than June 1, 2028. Both parties have the right to early terminate without additional penalty. The Company has determined that the Aldevron Amendment does not contain an embedded lease because it does not convey the right to control the use of Aldevron’s facility or related equipment therein.
Other Funding Commitments
The Company has several on-going clinical trials in various clinical trial stages. Its most significant clinical trial expenditures are to contract research organizations (“CROs”). The CRO contracts are generally cancellable at the Company’s option. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately $
594.5
 million in cancellable future commitments based on existing CRO contracts. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized approximately $
110.1
 million, 
$
112.2
 million and 
$
78.7
 million, respectively, for expenditures incurred by CROs.

Litigation

In the normal course of business, the Company from time to time is named as a party to various legal claims, actions and complaints, which have included and may include matters involving securities, employment, intellectual property, arising from the use of therapeutics utilizing its technology, or others. The Company records a loss contingency reserve for a legal proceeding when it considers the potential loss probable and it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss or determine a probable range of loss. The Company provides disclosure when it considers a loss reasonably possible or when it determines that a loss in excess of a reserve is reasonably possible. The Company provides an estimate of such reasonably possible losses or an aggregate range of such reasonably possible losses, unless the Company believes that such an estimate cannot be made. The Company has not recorded any material accruals for loss contingencies, and in management's opinion, no material range of loss is estimable for the matters described below as of December 31, 2024.
On September 15, 2020, REGENXBIO INC. (“Regenx”) and the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania (“U-Penn”) filed a lawsuit against the Company and Sarepta Therapeutics Three, LLC, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. The plaintiffs assert patent infringement of U.S. Patent No. 10,526,617 (“the ’617 Patent”) under 35 U.S.C.§§ 271(a)-(c) based on Sarepta’s alleged direct or indirect manufacture and use of the patented cultured host cell technology allegedly used to make AAV gene therapy products, including SRP-9001 (approved June 22, 2023 in the U.S. as ELEVIDYS®). Specifically, the Complaint essentially includes the allegation that Sarepta’s use, and the use by its contract manufacturers on its behalf, of a host cell containing a recombinant acid molecule that encodes a capsid protein having at least 95% amino acid identity to AAVrh10 infringes the ’617 Patent asserted by Regenx. Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief, a judgment of infringement and willful infringement, damages that are no less than a reasonable royalty (treble damages), attorneys’ fees and costs, and such other relief as the court deems just and proper. On January 5, 2024, the Court granted Sarepta’s motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the asserted claims of Regenx’s ’617 Patent are invalid because they cover patent ineligible subject matter under 35 U.S.C. § 101. On January 12, 2024, the Court entered judgment and closed the case. Plaintiffs have appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

On June 20, 2023, Regenx and U-Penn commenced a second patent infringement lawsuit against Sarepta and its contract manufacturer, Catalent asserting patent alleged infringement of U. S. Patent No. 11,680,274 (“the ’274 Patent”). In the second lawsuit, Regenx and U-Penn allege that Sarepta and Catalent’s manufacture, use and commercial launch of ELEVIDYS® (formerly/also known as SRP-9001) infringe the ’274 Patent. Sarepta answered the complaint on August 10, 2023, and a case schedule has been set

with a trial commencing on November 17, 2025. On February 21, 2024, Sarepta submitted a petition for Inter Partes Review for filing with the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”) at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”). The petition seeks to invalidate the ’274 Patent. On August 22, 2024, the PTAB instituted 
inter partes
 review of all challenged claims of the ’274 Patent on all asserted grounds.

On July 13, 2021, Nippon Shinyaku Co., Ltd. (“Nippon Shinyaku” or “NS”) filed a lawsuit against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. NS asserted a claim for breach of contract arising from Sarepta filing seven petitions for Inter Partes Review (“IPR Petitions”) with the PTAB at the USPTO in which Sarepta sought to invalidate certain NS patents concerning exon 53 skipping technology (U.S. Patent Nos. 9,708,361, 10,385,092, 10,407,461, 10,487,106, 10,647,741, 10,662,217, and 10,683,322, respectively, and collectively the “NS Patents”). In addition, NS asserted claims for patent infringement and willful infringement of each of the NS Patents allegedly arising from Sarepta’s activities, including the sale of, its exon 53 skipping product, VYONDYS 53 (golodirsen). NS further sought a determination of non-infringement by NS alleged to arise from NS’s activities, including the sale of, its exon 53 skipping product, Viltepso (viltolarsen) and invalidity of certain patents licensed to the Company from UWA (U.S. Patent Nos. 9,994,851, 10,227,590, and 10,266,827, collectively the “UWA Patents”). In its complaint, NS sought legal fees and costs, an unspecified amount of monetary relief (treble damages) attributed to Sarepta’s alleged infringement, and such other relief as the court deems just and proper. In January 2022, the PTAB granted institution of all claims of all NS Patents in response to Sarepta’s IPR Petitions and determined that Sarepta demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of success in proving that the NS Patents are unpatentable. NS filed a motion for preliminary injunction solely seeking Sarepta’s withdrawal of the IPR Petitions, which was ultimately granted after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed and remanded to the district court on February 8, 2022. Sarepta subsequently withdrew the IPRs, which were terminated on June 14, 2022. On December 27, 2021, the district court partially granted and denied the motion to dismiss by Sarepta and ordered NS to file a Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”), which it did on January 14, 2022. In the SAC, NS maintained all claims of the original complaint of July 13, 2021, except a determination of non-infringement of the UWA Patents. On January 28, 2022, Sarepta filed its answer to the SAC, with defenses and counterclaims against NS and NS Pharma Inc. that include infringement of the UWA Patents allegedly arising from their activities concerning, including the sale of, its exon 53 skipping product, Viltepso (viltolarsen) and breach of contract. Sarepta also sought a determination of invalidity of the NS Patents. In its counterclaim complaint, Sarepta sought an award of relief in its defenses to NS’ allegations, a judgment of breach of contract, a determination of invalidity of the NS Patents, a judgment of infringement and willful infringement of the UWA Patents, legal fees and costs, an unspecified amount of monetary relief (treble damages) attributable to NS’ alleged infringement, and such other relief as the court deems just and proper. UWA has since been joined as a Plaintiff in Sarepta’s counterclaims against NS. On August 14, 2023, the Court granted cross motions to amend the pleadings, allowing Sarepta to add a counterclaim against NS for inequitable conduct, and NS to add counterclaims against Sarepta for inequitable conduct and Walker Process fraud. The parties have since stipulated to the dismissal of NS’s claim of infringement of its ’361 Patent and certain claims of the ’322 Patent, and NS’s breach of contract claim. The Court bifurcated the Walker Process fraud claim on April 18, 2024, and granted Sarepta's motion for summary judgement of infringement of the ’851 Patent and NS’s motion for partial summary judgment of infringement of certain NS patents on May 1, 2024. After a jury trial in December 2024, the jury found that NS’s ’092 Patent is invalid as obvious and Sarepta’s and UWA’s ’851 Patent is not invalid. The jury did not find that NS’s infringement was willful. The jury awarded Sarepta approximately $
115.2
 million in damages for NS’s infringement relating to its sales of Viltepso in the United States, and the parties stipulated to approximately $
0.8
 million in reasonable royalty damages for NS's sales of Viltepso outside of the United States, both through December 15, 2024. Judgement was entered on January 7, 2025. On February 14, 2025, Sarepta filed a motion seeking supplemental damages and NS filed post-trial motions challenging the jury's verdict, as well as briefing relating to its inequitable conduct claim, which was tried to the court in December 2024.

On or about June 5, 2023, Sarepta initiated a patent infringement lawsuit against Nippon Shinyaku in Japan, alleging that NS’s production, sales and offers to sell Viltepso infringe Sarepta’s Japanese Patent No. 6406782. NS filed its preliminary answer on July 13, 2023. A technical presentation session occurred on July 26, 2024. Sarepta subsequently abandoned its claims and the case was terminated on January 30, 2025.

On July 26, 2024, Genzyme Corporation filed a lawsuit against Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. and Sarepta Therapeutics Three, LLC, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. The complaint asserts infringement of United States Patent Nos. 9,051,542 (the “’542 Patent”) and 7,704,721 (the “’721 Patent”) arising from Sarepta’s alleged manufacture and sale of ELEVIDYS® (delandistrogene moxeparvovec-rokl). In its complaint, Genzyme seeks, inter alia, damages for the alleged infringement, including increased damages up to three times the amount found or assessed, together with prejudgment and post-judgment interest and costs. Following a partial motion to dismiss by Sarepta, Genzyme filed its First Amended Complaint on November 21, 2024. In its First Amended Complaint, Genzyme no longer alleges willfulness or indirect infringement before the filing of the complaint. Sarepta answered the First Amended Complaint on December 12, 2024. The Court entered a scheduling order, with a trial scheduled for January 25, 2027.

On 
December 20, 2024, Brammer Bio MA, LLC filed an arbitration demand against Sarepta relating to Sarepta’s termination of the Thermo Agreement. Brammer Bio MA, LLC alleges claims for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith

and 
fair dealing and a violation of MGL c. 93A, and seeks relief including damages, treble damages, and attorneys’ fees and costs. On January 24, 2025, Sarepta filed its answer and asserted counterclaims for declaratory judgment and breach of contract, seeking relief including damages and attorneys’ fees and costs.
