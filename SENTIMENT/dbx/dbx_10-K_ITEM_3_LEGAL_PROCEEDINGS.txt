ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Legal Proceedings
We are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, claims, inquiries, and government investigations in the ordinary course of business, including legal proceedings with third parties asserting infringement of their intellectual property rights, regulatory matters and commercial disputes.
On July 12, 2019, Motion Offense, LLC (“Motion Offense”) filed a patent infringement suit in the Western District of Texas (Waco Division) against Dropbox's customer Sprouts Farmers Market (“Sprouts”), based on Sprouts’ use of Dropbox Business. The suit claims that Sprouts’ use of Dropbox Business infringes U.S. Patent Nos. 10,013,158 and 10,021,052. On August 14, 2019, in the District of Delaware, Dropbox filed a complaint for declaratory judgment of no infringement of the patents asserted against Sprouts by Motion Offense (“Delaware Action”), and subsequently amended the complaint to add claims for declaratory judgment that the asserted patents are invalid. Motion Offense’s motion to transfer the Delaware Action to the Western District of Texas was granted. The Western District of Texas stayed the Sprouts case pending resolution of the Dropbox case. On June 15, 2020, Motion Offense filed an amended answer to Dropbox’s declaratory judgment complaint, including counterclaims asserting that Dropbox infringes the 10,013,158 and 10,021,052 patents, as well as U.S. Patent Nos. 10,303,353, 10,613,737, and 10,587,548. On July 23, 2021, Motion Offense filed a related patent infringement suit against Dropbox in the Western District of Texas asserting that Dropbox also infringes U.S. Patent No. 11,044,215. The two cases were consolidated.
At the trial in May 2023, the jury found in favor of Dropbox on all counts including non-infringement and invalidity of the patents and awarded no damages to Motion Offense. Dropbox filed a Motion for Entry of Judgment on August 28, 2023 and on September 27, 2023, Motion Offense filed a Motion for a New Trial. At a hearing on January 3, 2024, the Court denied Motion Offense’s Motion for a New Trial. On January 8, 2024, the court ordered supplemental briefing relating to the Motion for Entry of Judgment and briefing. On August 29, 2024, the court entered judgement in line with the May 2023 jury verdict.

Table of Contents
On September 27, 2024, Motion Offense filed a Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law and a renewed Motion for a New Trial. Briefing is complete and Dropbox has requested a hearing on the Motions.
Before trial, Motion Offense filed a third patent infringement suit against Dropbox out of the same family of patents as the prior two suits. This suit was not consolidated into the trial. The case is currently stayed pending final resolution of the Inter Partes Review of the asserted patent. We believe Motion Offense’s allegations in that suit are similarly without merit and will vigorously defend against them.
While we remain confident in the Company’s defenses to the asserted allegations in these cases, it is not possible to determine the ultimate outcome at this time, and thus we cannot reasonably estimate the maximum potential exposure or range of possible loss.
Future litigation may be necessary, among other things, to defend ourselves or our users by determining the scope, enforceability, and validity of third-party proprietary rights or to establish our proprietary rights. The results of any current or future litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors.

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a comparison of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 see Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 16, 2024. 
Overview
Our modern economy runs on knowledge. Today, knowledge lives in the cloud as digital content, and Dropbox is where businesses and individuals can create, access, and share this content globally. We serve more than 700 million registered users across approximately 180 countries.
Since our founding in 2007, our market opportunity grew as we’ve expanded from keeping files in sync to keeping teams in sync. In a world where using technology at work can be fragmented and distracting, Dropbox makes it easy to focus on the work that matters.
By solving these universal problems, we’ve become invaluable to our users. The popularity of our platform allows us to scale efficiently. We’ve built a thriving global business with 18.22 million paying users.
Our Subscription Plans
We generate revenue from individuals, families, teams, and organizations by selling subscriptions to our platform, which serve the varying needs of our diverse customer base. Subscribers can purchase individual licenses through our Plus, Professional or Essentials plan, or purchase multiple licenses through our Family plan or our Standard, Advanced, Business, Business Plus and Enterprise team plans. We have also introduced Dash for Business, our AI-powered universal search tool, which we offer to teams at an additional cost. Each team or family represents a separately billed deployment that is managed through a single administrative dashboard. Teams must have a minimum of three users, but can also have more than tens of thousands of users. Families can have up to six users. Customers can choose between an annual or monthly plan, with a small number of large organizations on multi-year plans. A majority of our customers opt for our annual plans, although we have seen and may continue to see an increase in customers opting for our monthly plans. We typically bill our customers at the beginning of their respective terms and recognize revenue ratably over the term of the subscription period. International customers can pay in U.S. dollars or a select number of foreign currencies.
Our premium subscription plans, such as Professional and Advanced, provide more functionality than our other subscription plans and have higher per user prices. Our Standard and Advanced subscription plans offer robust capabilities for businesses, and the vast majority of Dropbox Business teams purchase our Standard or Advanced subscription plans. While our Enterprise subscription plan offers more opportunities for customization, companies can subscribe to any of these team plans for their business needs.
Our bundle subscription plans, such as Dropbox Essentials for solo professionals, Dropbox Business for small teams, and Dropbox Business Plus for larger teams, provide professionals and teams the ability to consolidate multiple offerings such as PDF editing, eSignature capabilities, document analytics, video collaboration tools, and advanced security functionality into a single place to manage their content.
We offer FormSwift, our cloud-based service that gives individuals and businesses a simple solution to create, complete, edit, and save critical business forms and agreements. Customers can choose between annual or monthly subscriptions based on their individual or business needs. We typically bill FormSwift customers at the beginning of their respective terms and recognize revenue ratably over the subscription period. FormSwift primarily sells within the United States, and the majority of its sales are in U.S. dollars.
We also offer DocSend as our secure document sharing and analytics solution. DocSend offers paid subscription plans, including a personal plan designed for individuals and Standard, Advanced, and Enterprise plans designed for business users

and teams. Similar to Dropbox plans, pricing of DocSend's plans is based on the number of licenses purchased. Customers can choose between an annual or monthly plan, with a small number of large organizations on multi-year plans. We typically bill DocSend customers at the beginning of their respective terms and recognize revenue ratably over the subscription period. DocSend primarily sells within the United States, and the majority of sales are in U.S. dollars.
We also offer Dropbox Sign, as our e-signature solution. Dropbox Sign has several product lines, and the pricing and revenue generated from each product line varies. Product lines are primarily priced based on the number of licenses purchased (similar to Dropbox plans), while some are priced based on a customer’s transaction volume. Depending on the product purchased, teams must have a minimum number of licenses, but can also have hundreds of users. Customers can choose between an annual or monthly plan, with a small number of large organizations on multi-year plans. We typically bill Dropbox Sign customers at the beginning of their respective terms and recognize revenue ratably over the subscription period. We sell Dropbox Sign products globally and sell primarily in U.S. dollars. 
Our Business Model
Drive new signups
We acquire users efficiently and at relatively low costs through word-of-mouth referrals, direct in-product referrals, and sharing of content. Anyone can create a Dropbox account for free through our website or app and be up and running in minutes. These users often share and collaborate with other non-registered users, attracting new signups into our network.
Increase conversion of registered users to our paid subscription plans
We generate over 90% of our revenue from self-serve channels—users who purchase a subscription through our app or website. To grow our recurring revenue base, we actively encourage our registered users to convert to one of our paid plans based on the functionality that best suits their needs. We do this via in-product prompts and notifications, time-limited free trials of paid subscription plans, email campaigns, and lifecycle marketing. We use these tactics in combination with the goal of generating increased recurring revenues from our existing user base. 
Upgrade and expand existing customers
We offer a range of paid subscription plans, from Plus, Professional, Essentials and Family for individuals to Standard, Advanced, Business, Business Plus and Enterprise for teams. We analyze usage patterns within our network and run hundreds of targeted marketing campaigns to encourage paying users to upgrade their plans. We prompt individual subscribers who collaborate with others on Dropbox to purchase our Standard, Advanced or Business, and Business Plus plans for a better team experience, and we also encourage existing Dropbox Business teams to purchase additional licenses or to upgrade to premium subscription plans. We also aim to offer additional products that expand our content collaboration capabilities, such as through our acquisitions of Dropbox Sign, DocSend and Reclaim.
Virtual First
In October 2020, we announced our Virtual First work model pursuant to which remote work has become the primary experience for all of our employees. As a result, we have seen our workforce become more distributed over time, although we are continuing to offer our employees opportunities for in-person collaboration in all locations we currently have offices, either through our existing real-estate that were repurposed into collaborative spaces called “Dropbox Studios” or flexible workspaces known as “On-Demand Spaces”. Consistent with this strategy, we have retained a portion of our office space while the remainder is being or will be subleased. 
We recorded impairment charges to net loss (gain) on real estate assets of $0.1 million and $3.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to right-of-use assets and other lease related property and equipment assets. See Note 9, "Leases" for additional information. We may incur additional impairment charges depending on the state of the corporate real estate market or shifts in our Virtual First strategy.
In October 2023, we executed a partial termination of our lease for our San Francisco, California corporate headquarters and subsequently recorded a gain on real estate assets of $158.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. The gain represents the reduction to our future lease payments in excess of the sublease income we previously anticipated collecting for this space. See Note 9, "Leases" for additional information.

Recent Developments
Impact of Macroeconomic Factors on our Business
Our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions and their impact on customer behavior. Uncertain economic conditions including inflation, fluctuations in interest rates, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, and other conditions may adversely impact our results of operations and financial performance.  
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we experienced mixed performance across our plans. Growth in Individual plans was offset by ongoing pressure within our Teams plans, as businesses faced a challenging operating environment. Additionally, while DocSend delivered better-than-anticipated results, FormSwift faced continued pressure in the second half of the year. 
We have seen and may continue to see cost savings from our Virtual First work model in areas including events, travel, utilities, and other benefits. Due to our subscription-based business model, any impact of the current macroeconomic environment on our business, particularly as a result of changes in our customer behavior, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods, if at all. For a further discussion of the potential impacts of the macroeconomic environment on our business, see “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A. of this report.
Cybersecurity
In April 2024, we became aware of unauthorized access to the Dropbox Sign production environment, as previously disclosed in our Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 1, 2024. While we remain subject to various risks due to the incident, including ongoing litigation and regulatory scrutiny, as of the date of this filing, it has not had, and no facts have come to light indicating that it is likely to have, a material impact on Dropbox’s overall financial condition or results of operations. 
Reduction in Workforce
In October 2024, we announced a reduction of our global workforce by approximately 20% to streamline our team structure to better align with our long-term growth and profitability objectives. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we incurred $47.2 million of expenses related to severance, benefits, and other related items. See Note 1 "Description of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Reduction in Workforce" for additional information.
Key Business Metrics
We review a number of operating and financial metrics, including the following key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions. 
Total annual recurring revenue
We primarily focus on total annual recurring revenue (“Total ARR”) as the key indicator of the trajectory of our business performance. Total ARR represents the amount of revenue that we expect to recur annually, enables measurement of the progress of our business initiatives, and serves as an indicator of future growth. In addition, Total ARR is less subject to variations in short-term trends that may not appropriately reflect the health of our business; however, the changes in ARR throughout the year could be subject to seasonality. Total ARR is a performance metric and should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue, and is not intended to be a substitute for, or combined with, any of these items.
Our ARR fluctuates and may decrease in some periods as compared to prior periods. For example, ARR decreased in the fourth quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2024 as a result of increased churn in Teams plans offset by growth in Individual plans. We expect a slight decline in our ARR growth in the near term due to our strategic decision to significantly reduce our investments in Formswift at the beginning of 2025, decreased resourcing due to our reduction in workforce, and headwinds stemming from a challenging operating environment, particularly as it relates to our Teams plans.
Total ARR consists of contributions from all of our revenue streams, including subscriptions and add-ons. We calculate Total ARR as the number of users who have active paid licenses for access to our platform as of the end of the period, multiplied by their annualized subscription price. We first include ARR related to acquired companies in our total ARR in the

Table of Contents
period of the acquisition. We adjust the exchange rates used to calculate Total ARR on an annual basis at the beginning of each fiscal year.
Total ARR increased for the period ended December 31, 2024, compared to the period ended December 31, 2023 primarily driven by an increase in paying users in our Individual plans offset by upsell weakness and churn in Teams plans. In 2024, ARR was positively impacted by the foreign currency exchange rates used to calculate ARR compared to 2023, as we update exchange rates annually at the beginning of the year.
The below tables set forth our Total ARR using the exchange rates set at the beginning of the applicable year, as well as on a constant currency basis relative to the exchange rates used in 2024.

Revaluing our ending Total ARR for fiscal 2024 using exchange rates set at the beginning of fiscal 2025, Total ARR at the end of fiscal 2024 would be $2,567 million.
Paying users
We define paying users as the number of users who have active paid licenses for access to our platform as of the end of the period. One person would count as multiple paying users if the person had more than one active license. For example, a 50-person Dropbox Enterprise team would count as 50 paying users, and an individual Dropbox Plus user would count as one paying user. If that individual Dropbox Plus user was also part of the 50-person Dropbox Enterprise team, we would count the individual as two paying users. We first include paying users related to acquired companies among our paying users in the period of the acquisition.
For DocSend, FormSwift and Reclaim, we define paying users as the number of users who have active paid licenses for access to our platform as of the end of the period.
Dropbox Sign has several product lines and the pricing and revenue generated from each product line varies, with some product lines priced based on the number of licenses purchased (similar to Dropbox plans), while others are priced based on a customer’s transaction volume. For purposes of Dropbox Sign results, we include as paying users either (i) the number of users who have active paid licenses for access to the Dropbox Sign platform as of the period end for those products that are priced based on the number of licenses purchased (which is the same method we use to evaluate existing Dropbox plans) or (ii) the number of customers for those products that are priced based on transaction volumes. 
The number of paying users as of December 31, 2024 grew as compared to December 31, 2023, largely from an increase in paying users in Individual plans and from our acquisition of Reclaim partially offset by a decrease in paying users due to downsell pressures across our Teams plans. However, our overall paying user growth rate has declined and may decline in the future. 
The total number of paying users fluctuates and may decrease in some periods as compared to prior periods. For example, paying users decreased slightly in the fourth quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to challenges in Teams and expected seasonality within our business offset by growth in Individual plans. We expect a slight decrease in our net new paying users in the near term, due to our strategic decision to significantly reduce our investments in FormSwift at the beginning of 2025, decreased resourcing due to our reduction in workforce, and a challenging operating environment, particularly as it relates to Teams plans.

Average revenue per paying user
We define average revenue per paying user, or ARPU, as our revenue for the period presented divided by the average paying users during the same period. For interim periods, we use annualized revenue, which is calculated by dividing the revenue for the particular period by the number of days in that period and multiplying this value by 365 days. Average paying users are calculated based on adding the number of paying users as of the beginning of the period to the number of paying users as of the end of the period, and then dividing by two.
As a result of an increased mix of sales towards our higher priced plans, as well as a shift to monthly subscription plans, which have a higher price point than our annual plans, we experienced an increase in our average revenue per paying user for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively.
The below table sets forth our ARPU for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure
In addition to our results determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, we believe that free cash flow, or FCF, a non-GAAP financial measure, is useful in evaluating our liquidity.
Free cash flow
We define FCF as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We believe that FCF is a liquidity measure and that it provides useful information regarding cash provided by operating activities and cash used for investments in property and equipment required to maintain and grow our business. FCF is presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. FCF has limitations as an analytical tool, and it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by operating activities. Some of the limitations of FCF are that FCF does not reflect our future contractual commitments, excludes investments made to acquire assets under finance leases, includes capital expenditures, and may be calculated differently by other companies in our industry, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
Our FCF increased for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to an increase in cash provided by operating activities for the reasons discussed below, including improvements in operating efficiencies, partially offset by an increase in payments related to our 2024 reduction in workforce as compared to our 2023 reduction in workforce.
We expect our FCF to generally increase in the near term as we drive operating efficiencies, partly due to our 2024 reduction in workforce. We expect to continue to purchase infrastructure equipment to support our user base and anticipate that our capital expenditures will generally remain consistent in future periods as we continue to invest in our internal infrastructure, network and security. The timing of our operating expenses as described below, may cause FCF to vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue. 
The following is a reconciliation of FCF to the most comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating activities:

Components of Our Results of Operations
Revenue
We generate revenue from sales of subscriptions to our platform.
Revenue is recognized ratably over the related contractual term generally beginning on the date that our platform is made available to a customer. Our subscription agreements typically have monthly or annual contractual terms, although a small percentage have multi-year contractual terms. Our agreements are generally non-cancelable. We typically bill in advance for monthly contracts and annually in advance for contracts with terms of one year or longer. Amounts that have been billed are initially recorded as deferred revenue until the revenue is recognized.
Our revenue is driven primarily by conversions and upsells to our paid plans. We also generate revenue from transaction based products and fees from the referral of users to our partners. We generate over 90% of our revenue from self-serve channels. No customer represented more than 1% of our revenue in the periods presented.
Our revenue growth is impacted by our number of paying users, as well as our ability to increase the average revenue per paying user. Our overall paying user growth rate has declined and we expect growth in paying users to fluctuate from period to period in the future. Accordingly, if we do not increase the average revenue per paying user, for example through pricing and packaging changes or increased sales of our higher-priced subscription plans, to offset slower growth or decline in paying users, our revenue and revenue growth rate will decline.
Cost of revenue and gross margin
Cost of revenue.
 Our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the storage, delivery, and distribution of our platform for both paying users and free users. These costs, which we refer to as infrastructure costs, include depreciation of our servers located in co-location facilities that we lease and operate, rent and facilities expense for those datacenters, network and bandwidth costs, support and maintenance costs for our infrastructure equipment, and payments to third-party datacenter service providers. Cost of revenue also includes salaries, bonuses, employer payroll taxes and benefits, travel-related expenses, expenses related to our reduction in workforce such as severance, benefits and other related items, and stock-based compensation, which we refer to as employee-related costs, for employees whose primary responsibilities relate to supporting our infrastructure and delivering user support. Other non-employee costs included in cost of revenue include credit card fees related to processing customer transactions, and allocated overhead, such as facilities, including rent, utilities, depreciation on leasehold improvements and other equipment shared by all departments, and shared information technology costs. In addition, cost of revenue includes amortization of developed technologies, professional fees related to user support initiatives, and property taxes related to the datacenters.
We plan to continue increasing the capacity and enhancing the capability and reliability of our infrastructure to support user growth and increased use of our platform. We expect that cost of revenue will decrease slightly in absolute dollars in the near term due to a one-time benefit of increasing the useful lives of certain infrastructure server and component assets from four to five years and increase in absolute dollars in the long term as the benefit lapses. See Note 1. "Description of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Use of Estimates" for additional information.
Gross margin.
 Gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue. Our gross margin may fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of additional capital expenditures and the related depreciation expense, or other increases in our infrastructure costs, as well as revenue fluctuations. We expect gross margin to decrease slightly in the near term as we lap the benefit of our extension of useful lives of certain infrastructure server and component assets and remain relatively constant in the long term. See Note 1. "Description of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Use of Estimates" for additional information.
Operating expenses
Research and development
. Our research and development expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs for our engineering, product, and design teams, expenses related to our reduction in workforce such as severance, benefits and other related items, compensation expenses related to key personnel from acquisitions and allocated overhead. These groups are responsible for the design, development, testing, delivery of new technologies and features, and support of our self-serve platform. We continue to focus our product development efforts on adding new features and enhancing the functionality and ease of use of our offerings. Additionally, research and development expenses include internal development-related third-party hosting fees. We have expensed almost all of our research and development costs as they were incurred.
55
Table of Contents
We expect that research and development costs will decrease in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in both the near term and long term as a result of our 2024 reduction in workforce, partially offset by continued hiring for our engineering, product, and design teams in roles critical to our future growth initiatives.
Sales and marketing
. Our sales and marketing expenses relate to both self-serve and outbound sales activities, and consist primarily of employee-related costs, expenses related to our reduction in workforce such as severance, benefits and other related items, advertising costs, brand marketing costs, lead generation costs, sponsorships and allocated overhead. Sales commissions earned by our outbound sales team and the related payroll taxes, as well as commissions earned by third-party resellers that we consider to be incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer, are deferred and are typically amortized over an estimated period of benefit of five years. Additionally, sales and marketing expenses include non-employee costs related to app store fees, fees payable to third-party sales representatives and amortization of acquired customer relationships.
We expect that sales and marketing expenses will decrease in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in both the near term and long term as a result of our 2024 reduction in workforce, partially offset by continued investment in sales and marketing in the long term, in order to grow our user base and increase our brand awareness. The trend and timing of sales and marketing expenses will depend in part on the timing of marketing campaigns.
General and administrative
. Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs for our legal, finance, human resources, and other administrative teams, as well as certain executives. In addition, general and administrative expenses include expenses related to our reduction in workforce such as severance, benefits and other related items, allocated overhead, outside legal, accounting and other professional fees, non income-based taxes, and the recognition of stock-based compensation expense related to the grant of restricted stock made to our co-founder.
We expect to incur additional general and administrative expenses to support the growth of the Company. We expect that general and administrative expenses will fluctuate in absolute dollars in future periods and remain relatively constant in both the near term and the long term as a percentage of revenue.
Net loss (gain) on real estate assets
Net loss (gain) on real estate assets consists of impairment charges related to certain right-of-use assets and other lease related property and equipment assets in 2024 and 2023 and a gain due to the partial termination of our lease for our San Francisco, California corporate headquarters in 2023. See Note 9, "Leases" for additional information.
Interest income, net
Interest income, net consists primarily of interest income earned on our investments classified as cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments, offset by interest expense related to our term loan facility, finance lease obligations for infrastructure and amortization of debt issuance costs.
Other income (loss), net
Other income (loss), net consists of other non-operating gains or losses, including those related to gains or losses on sale of assets, foreign currency transaction gains and losses, lease arrangements, which include sublease income, and realized gains and losses related to our short-term investments.
Provision for income taxes
Provision for income taxes consists of U.S. federal, state and foreign jurisdiction income taxes. For 2024 and 2023, the difference between the U.S. statutory rate and our effective tax rate is primarily due to jurisdictional mix of earnings, tax credits, state income taxes, and changes to our unrecognized tax benefits.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.3 billion and short-term investments of $265.9 million, which were held for working capital purposes. Our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments consist primarily of cash, money market funds, corporate notes and obligations, U.S. Treasury securities, certificates of deposit, asset-backed securities, commercial paper, foreign government securities, U.S. agency obligations, supranational securities, and municipal securities. As of December 31, 2024, $410.3 million of our cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. We do not expect to incur material taxes in the event we repatriate any of these amounts. Our cash is held at several large financial institutions and our investments are focused on the preservation of capital, fulfillment of our liquidity needs, and maximization of investment performance within the parameters set forth in our investment policy and subject to market conditions. The investment policy sets forth credit rating minimums, permissible allocations, and limits our exposure to specific investment types. We believe these policies mitigate our exposure to risk concentrations.
We have historically financed our operations primarily through cash generated from our operations, the convertible senior notes (the "Notes") issuance, borrowings from our term loan facility, equity issuances, and finance leases to finance infrastructure-related assets in co-location facilities that we directly lease and operate. We enter into finance leases in part to better match the timing of payments for infrastructure-related assets with that of cash received from our paying users. In our business model, some of our registered users convert to paying users over time, and consequently there is a lag between initial investment in infrastructure assets and cash received from some of our users. We also have a term loan facility for additional working capital flexibility, as described below.
In February 2021, we issued approximately $1.4 billion in aggregate principal amount of the Notes, comprised of $695.8 million in aggregate principal amount of 2026 Notes and $693.3 million in aggregate principal amount of 2028 Notes. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2026 Notes and 2028 Notes were $684.8 million, net of debt issuance costs, and $682.3 million, net of debt issuance costs, respectively. The 2026 Notes mature on March 1, 2026 and the 2028 Notes mature on March 1, 2028. The Notes of each series do not bear regular interest and the principal does not accrete. The Notes of each series may bear special interest as the remedy relating to our failure to comply with certain of our reporting obligations. These Notes can be converted or repurchased prior to maturity if certain conditions are met.
Our principal uses of cash in recent periods have been funding our operations, repurchases of our Class A common stock, purchases of short-term investments, the satisfaction of tax withholding obligations in connection with the settlement of restricted stock units and awards, making principal payments on our finance lease obligations, and capital expenditures. 
In February 2022, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $
1.2
 billion of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock. 
In July 2023, our Board of Directors further authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $1.2 billion of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock.

We completed the February 2022 authorization of $1.2 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and continued stock repurchases under the July 2023 authorization. In December 2024, our Board of Directors further authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $1.2 billion of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock. Share repurchases will be made from time-to-time in private transactions or open market purchases as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements and will be subject to a review of the circumstances in place at that time, including prevailing market prices. The program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares and has no specified time limit; it may be discontinued at any time. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we repurchased and subsequently retired 49.5 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of $1.2 billion. The 1% excise tax imposed as part of the Inflation Reduction Act is included in the cost of treasury stock acquired pursuant to common share repurchases. The pace of our share repurchases may fluctuate due to various circumstances, including market conditions and our stock price.
In December 2024, we entered into a secured five-year term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $2.0 billion, consisting of initial term loans and delayed draw term loan commitments each in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.0 billion, respectively. The terms of the agreement also provide for a secured letter of credit facility in an aggregate amount of up to $35.0 million. The term loans have a maturity date of December 11, 2029, with quarterly principal payments beginning on March 31, 2025 and continuing on the last business day of each quarter thereafter, equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of such term loans. As of December 31, 2024, we had $1.0 billion outstanding on the initial term loans, no amounts outstanding on the delayed draw term loan commitments, and no letters of credit issued under the secured letter of credit facility. 
Interest on borrowings under the term loan facility accrues at either an alternate base rate or a term SOFR rate (further described in Note 8 "Debt") at the Company's option. Pursuant to the terms of the term loan facility, we are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee that accrues at a rate of 1.00% per annum on the unused portion of the delayed draw term loan commitments.

Table of Contents
The term loan facility permits the Company, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including obtaining commitments from new or existing lenders, to add new term loan facilities or increase the term loan commitments under the term loan agreement, in each case, subject to certain limits. Additionally, the term loan agreement contains customary representations and warranties, customary affirmative and negative covenants, and customary events of default. Failure to comply with these covenants may result in a portion of the outstanding term loan debt becoming due immediately. We were in compliance with all covenants under the term loan facility as of December 31, 2024. 
As of December 31, 2024, we have utilized a significant portion of our U.S. federal, state and foreign net operating losses. Future utilization of remaining net operating loss and research credit carryforwards are subject to statutory limits. 
We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with our short-term investments, cash provided by operations and amounts available under the term loan facility, will be sufficient to meet our needs for the foreseeable future. In addition to the Notes and obligations under the term loan facility discussed above, as of December 31, 2024, we have cash commitments due to additional known contractual obligations. Our cash commitments due to known contractual obligations primarily relate to operating and finance lease arrangements. As of December 31, 2024, we additionally had $154.1 million of commitments with third-party vendors for services related to our infrastructure, infrastructure warranty contracts, and asset retirement obligations for office modifications, with terms of 12 years or less.
Our operating lease arrangements consist of leases for our offices and datacenters with terms of 12 years or less. As of December 31, 2024, future non-cancelable minimum rental payments related to operating leases were $578.8 million, which includes $200.1 million of future contractual rent payments allocated to non-lease components, and excludes rent payments from our subtenants and variable operating expenses. As of December 31, 2024, we are entitled to non-cancelable rent payments from our subtenants of $59.9 million, which will be collected over the next 9 years. Our finance lease arrangements primarily consist of leases for our infrastructure with terms of 4 years or less. As of December 31, 2024, future non-cancelable minimum rental payments under finance leases were $355.7 million. Refer to Note 9, "Leases", for more information.
Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our revenue growth rate, subscription renewal activity, billing frequency, the timing and extent of spending to support further infrastructure development and research and development efforts, the timing and extent of additional capital expenditures to invest in infrastructure equipment to support our user base, our ability to sublease space at office locations where we have unused spaces, the satisfaction of tax withholding obligations for the release of restricted stock units and awards, the expansion of sales and marketing and international operation activities, the introduction of new product capabilities and enhancement of our platform, the continuing market acceptance of our platform, and the volume, timing, and amount of our share repurchases. In addition, we have and may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, and technologies, including intellectual property rights. In light of all these circumstances, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing, or we may decide to do so opportunistically. In the event that additional financing is required or desired from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.

Operating activities
Our largest source of operating cash is cash collections from our paying users for subscriptions to our platform. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee-related expenditures, infrastructure-related costs, and marketing expenses. Net cash provided by operating activities is impacted by our net income adjusted for certain non-cash items,

Table of Contents
including stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization expenses, as well as the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was $894.1 million, which primarily consisted of our net income of $452.3 million, adjusted for stock-based compensation expense of $346.5 million, depreciation and amortization expenses of $137.3 million, and net cash outflow of $111.5 million from operating assets and liabilities. The outflow from operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to the payment of our corporate bonus, payments for our reduction in workforce, and the payment for the second tranche termination fee for the partial termination of our lease for our San Francisco, California corporate headquarters, offset by an increase in deferred revenue from increased subscription sales, as a majority of our paying users are invoiced in advance. 
The increase of $110.4 million in net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, was primarily due to an increase of $75.1 million in net income, as adjusted for stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization expenses. Additionally, there was a decrease of $35.3 million in cash outflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities.
Investing activities
Net cash provided by investing activities is primarily impacted by net investment activity, which includes sales, maturities, and purchases of short-term investments, cash paid for acquisitions, and for purchasing infrastructure equipment in co-location facilities that we directly lease and operate.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash provided by investing activities was $443.8 million, which primarily related to $493.1 million in net investment activity inflows, driven by the sales and maturities of short-term investments, net of purchases. The increase was partially offset by cash paid for acquisitions of $57.8 million and cash paid for capital expenditures of $22.5 million related to infrastructure build-outs and purchased components, spares, and laptops.
The increase of $48.6 million in net cash provided by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, was primarily due to an increase of $97.2 million in net investment activity inflows and a decrease of $1.8 million in cash paid for capital expenditures, offset by an increase of $57.8 million in cash paid for acquisitions.
Financing activities
Net cash used in financing activities is primarily impacted by cash used for repurchases of common stock, tax withholding obligations for the release of restricted stock units ("RSUs") and restricted stock awards ("RSAs"), principal payments on finance lease obligations for our infrastructure equipment, and payments of acquisition-related indemnity holdback amounts, offset by proceeds from the term loan facility. 
For the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was $586.6 million, which primarily consisted of $1,241.6 million for the repurchase of our common stock, $148.7 million for the satisfaction of tax withholding obligations for the release of restricted stock units and awards, and $129.4 million in principal payments on finance lease obligations. The outflow was offset by net proceeds from the term loan facility of $949.9 million.
The decrease of $212.6 million in net cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, was primarily due to proceeds from the term loan facility, net of debt issuance costs of $950.0 million, offset by an increase of $701.7 million in repurchases of our common stock and an increase of $17.7 million in cash paid for the release of acquisition-related indemnity holdback payments after the acquisition date in accordance with the merger agreement.

Significant Impacts of Stock-Based Compensation
Co-Founder Grant
In December 2017, the Board of Directors approved the grant to Drew Houston, the Company's Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, of 10.3 million shares of Class A common stock in the form of RSAs (the "Co-Founder Grant"). This Co-Founder Grant has service-based, market-based, and performance-based vesting conditions. The Co-Founder Grant is excluded from Class A common stock issued and outstanding until the satisfaction of these vesting conditions. The Co-Founder Grant also provides the holder with certain stockholder rights, such as the right to vote the shares with the other holders of Class A common stock and a right to cumulative declared dividends. 
The Co-Founder Grant is eligible to vest over the ten-year period following the date the Company’s shares of Class A common stock commenced trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market in connection with the Company’s IPO. The Co-Founder Grant is comprised of nine tranches that are eligible to vest based on the achievement of stock price goals, each of which are referred to as a Stock Price Target, measured over a consecutive thirty-day trading period during the Performance Period. The Performance Period began on January 1, 2019.

The first tranche of the Co-Founder Grant, or 2.1 million shares of Class A common stock, vested in the fourth quarter of 2021. The stock-based compensation expense for the Co-Founder Grant is recognized utilizing the accelerated attribution method over the requisite service period identified as the derived service period over which the market conditions are expected to be achieved, and is not reversed if the market conditions are not satisfied.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, in the United States. The preparation of consolidated financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by management. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows will be affected.
While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 “Description of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the accounting policies described below involve a greater degree of judgment and estimation uncertainty.

Net loss (gain) on real estate assets
We assess any changes to lease agreements in accordance with ASC 842, Leases (“ASC 842”). When amendments to existing lease agreements occur, we remeasure and reallocate the remaining consideration to the lease and non-lease components in the contract using a relative standalone price allocation, as well as reassess the classification of the lease at the effective date of the modification.
In the fourth quarter of 2023, we executed an amendment to the lease ("the lease amendment") for our San Francisco, California corporate headquarters. As a result of the lease amendment, we remeasured the related lease liability and right-of-use asset using the estimated incremental borrowing rate as of the modification date and using a relative standalone price reallocation of total contract consideration between the lease and non-lease components of the contract. The non-lease components include common area maintenance costs, which are significant in relation to the overall agreement. The determination of the standalone price of the lease and non-lease components involved judgment and was based on assumptions including future market rent rates, free rent periods and anticipated increases to common area maintenance costs. As a result of the lease amendment, we recognized a one-time gain of $158.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 from the corresponding remeasurement of the lease liability and adjustment to the right-of-use asset (which was previously impaired), partially offset by an increase in the liability for unrecoverable common area maintenance costs. Refer to Note 9, "Leases", for more information.
In accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment (“ASC 360”), we evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. When the projected undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts, the assets are adjusted to their estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recorded as a component of operating income.
As a result of our Virtual First strategy, we reassess our asset groupings and evaluate the recoverability of our right-of-use and related lease assets, including leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, and computer equipment. We monitor ongoing changes in the corporate real estate market that may impact our subleasing strategy in conjunction with our Virtual First model. We recorded impairment charges related to real estate assets of $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2024. Estimating the fair value of our real estate assets can require the application of significant judgment. Refer to Note 9, "Leases", for more information. 
Income Taxes
Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply when taxes are actually paid or recovered. In addition, deferred tax assets are recorded for net operating loss and credit carryforwards.
A valuation allowance is provided against deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that they will be realized based on all available positive and negative evidence. Such evidence, which requires management's judgment, includes, but is not limited to, recent cumulative earnings or losses, expectations of future taxable income by taxing jurisdiction, and the carry-forward periods available for the utilization of deferred tax assets. To the extent sufficient positive evidence becomes available, we may release all or a portion of our valuation allowance in one or more future periods. 
During the years ended December 31, 2024, and 2023, we evaluated the realizability of our deferred tax assets, which did not result in the release of any part of our historical valuation allowance. Future releases of the remaining valuation allowance, if any, would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets which may include a material income tax benefit for the period in which such release is recorded. Refer to Note 14, “Income Taxes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.
Change in Accounting Estimate
In the first quarter of 2024, we determined that the useful lives of certain infrastructure server and component assets, which are included in “Property and equipment, net”, should be increased from four to five years, as we plan to extend the economic life of these assets in light of recent technological advancements. This change in useful lives was effective beginning in fiscal year 2024, and had a favorable impact for the full fiscal year 2024 to cost of revenue and operating income of $30.5 million based on assets that were included in “Property and equipment, net” as of December 31, 2023.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Interest rate risk
We had cash and cash equivalents of $1.3 billion and short-term investments of $265.9 million as of December 31, 2024. We hold our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments for working capital purposes. Our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments consist primarily of cash, money market funds, corporate notes and obligations, U.S. Treasury securities, certificates of deposit, asset-backed securities, commercial paper, foreign government securities, U.S. agency obligations, supranational securities, and municipal securities. The primary objectives of our investment activities are the preservation of capital, the fulfillment of liquidity needs, and the control of cash and investments. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of debt securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates.
As of December 31, 2024, a hypothetical increase in interest rates by 100 basis points would have had an immaterial impact on the market value of our investment portfolio. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur.
Any borrowings under the term loan facility bear interest, at our option, at either (a) an alternate base rate, which is defined as a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the greatest of (i) the prime rate then in effect, (ii) the federal funds rate then in effect, plus 0.50% per annum, and (iii) a term SOFR rate determined on the basis of a one-month interest period plus 1.00% per annum, in each case, plus a margin of 2.75%, or (b) an overnight or term SOFR rate (based on one, three or six month interest periods), plus a margin of 3.75%. As of December 31, 2024, we had $1.0 billion outstanding under the term loan facility. We do not have any other long-term debt or financial liabilities with floating interest rates that would subject us to interest rate fluctuations. As of December 31, 2024, a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates by 100 basis points would have had an immaterial impact on our interest expense related to the term loan facility.
Foreign currency exchange risk
Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to U.S. dollars, our reporting currency. 
Most of our revenue is generated in U.S. dollars, with the remainder generated in Euros, British pounds sterling, Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, and Japanese yen. 
Our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies in which our operations are located, which are primarily the United States and, to a lesser extent, Europe and Asia. The functional currency of Dropbox International Unlimited, our international headquarters and largest international entity, is denominated in U.S. dollars. Our results of operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates in ways that are unrelated to our operating performance. 
As exchange rates may fluctuate significantly between periods, revenue and operating expenses, when converted into U.S. dollars, may also experience significant fluctuations between periods. Volatile market conditions, including those arising from macroeconomic events, such as the volatility and uncertainty in the banking and financial services sector, fluctuating interest rates, tightening of credit markets, as well as geopolitical events have and may in the future result in significant changes in exchange rates, and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar has and may in the future negatively affect our revenue expressed in U.S. dollars. Historically, a majority of our revenue and operating expenses have been denominated in U.S. dollars, Euros, and British pounds sterling. Although we are impacted by the exchange rate movements from a number of currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, our results of operations are particularly impacted by fluctuations in the U.S. dollar-Euro and U.S. dollar-British pounds sterling exchange rates. During the year ended December 31, 2024, 26% of our sales were denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Our expenses, by contrast, are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result, any increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies could cause our revenue to decline relative to our costs, thereby decreasing our margins.
Net foreign currency transaction gains and losses were immaterial during the year ended December 31, 2024 and we recorded net foreign currency transaction losses of $3.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency rates would not have resulted in material gains or losses for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
To date, we have not engaged in any hedging activities. As our international operations grow, we will continue to reassess our approach to managing risks relating to fluctuations in currency rates.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Dropbox, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Dropbox, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' deficit and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 21, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
Description of the Matter
As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company derives its revenue from subscription fees from customers for access to its platform, which is recognized ratably over the related contractual term. 
Auditing the Company's revenue recognition required significant effort due to the high volume of individually-low-monetary-value transactions that are processed through several applications responsible for initiation, processing, and recording.
69
Table of Contents
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls over revenue recognition. For example, with the assistance of IT professionals, we tested the internal controls over billing of subscriptions, reconciliation of billings to cash receipts, and revenue recognition. 
To test the Company’s accounting for revenue recognition, we performed substantive audit procedures that included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data within the Company’s billing system, and by performing data analytics to evaluate the recognition of revenue and deferred revenue amounts.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Dropbox, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Dropbox, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Dropbox, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 
consolidated balance sheets of the Company

as of December 31, 
2024
 and 
2023
, the related consolidated statements of
 operations,
 comprehensive income, 
stockholders’ deficit
 and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 
2024
, and the related notes 
and our report dated February 21, 2025 expressed 
an unqualified opinion thereon
.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Amounts in tables are in millions except per share data, or as otherwise noted)
Note 1. 
Description of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Business
Dropbox, Inc. (the “Company” or “Dropbox”) helps keep life organized and work moving. The Company was incorporated in May 2007 as Evenflow, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and changed its name to Dropbox, Inc. in October 2009. The Company is headquartered in San Francisco, California. 
Basis of presentation and consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the United States of America generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Dropbox and its wholly owned subsidiaries
. 
All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.
The Company’s most significant estimates and judgments are related to the valuation of right-of-use and other lease related property and equipment assets as well as income taxes. 
The Company reviews the useful lives of long-lived assets on an ongoing basis, and effective January 1, 2024, the Company changed the estimate of the useful lives of certain infrastructure server and component assets, which are included in property and equipment, net and are depreciated through cost of revenue, from 
four
 to 
five years
. The Company has extended the economic life of these assets in light of recent technological advancements. The effect of this change in estimate during the year ended December 31, 2024 was a reduction in depreciation expense of $
30.5
 million, and a benefit to net income of $
23.5
 million or $
0.07
 per basic and diluted share. The impact from the change in the Company's estimate was calculated based on assets that existed as of the effective date of the change and applying the revised estimated useful lives prospectively.

Financial information about segments and geographic areas
The Company manages its operations and allocates resources as a single operating segment. Further, the Company manages, monitors, and reports its financial information as a single reportable segment.
 See Note 15 "Segment Information and Geographic Areas" for additional information.
Foreign currency transactions
The assets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are translated from their respective functional currencies into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenue and expense amounts are translated at the average exchange rate for the period. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are recorded in other comprehensive income, net of tax.
Gains and losses realized from foreign currency transactions (those transactions denominated in currencies other than the foreign subsidiaries’ functional currency) are included in other income (loss), net. Monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured using foreign currency exchange rates at the end of the period, and non-monetary assets are remeasured based on historical exchange rates.
 Foreign currency transaction gains or losses were 
immaterial
 during the year ended December 31, 2024 and the Company recorded net foreign currency transaction losses of $
3.2
 million during the year ended December 31, 2023.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Amounts in tables are in millions except per share data, or as otherwise noted)
Revenue recognition
The Company derives its revenue from subscription fees from customers for access to its platform. The Company’s policy is to exclude sales and other indirect taxes when measuring the transaction price of its subscription agreements. The Company accounts for revenue contracts with customers through the following steps:
•
Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer
•
Identification of the performance obligations in the contract
•
Determination of the transaction price
•
Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
•
Recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation
The Company’s subscription agreements are generally non-cancelable and have monthly or annual contractual terms with a small percentage having multi-year contractual terms. Revenue is recognized ratably over the related contractual term beginning on the date that the platform is made available to a customer. Access to the platform represents a series of distinct services as the Company continually provides access to, and fulfills its obligation to the end customer over the subscription term. The series of distinct services represents a single performance obligation that is satisfied over time. The Company recognizes revenue ratably because the customer receives and consumes the benefits of the platform throughout the contract period. 
The Company bills in advance for monthly contracts and typically bills annually in advance for contracts with terms of 
one year or longer
. The Company also recognizes an immaterial amount of contract assets, or unbilled receivables, primarily related to consideration for services completed but not billed at the reporting date. Unbilled receivables are classified as receivables when the Company has the right to invoice the customer.
The Company records contract liabilities when cash payments are received or due in advance of performance to deferred revenue. Deferred revenue primarily relates to the advance consideration received from the customer.
The price of subscriptions is generally fixed at contract inception and therefore, the Company’s contracts do not contain a significant amount of variable consideration. As a result, the amount of revenue recognized in the periods presented from performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods was not material.
The Company recognized 
$
724.0
 million, $
701.6
 million and 
$
671.5
 million of revenue during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, that was included in the deferred revenue balances at the beginning of their respective periods.
As of December 31, 2024, future estimated revenue related to performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied was 
$
810.4
 million. The substantial majority of the unsatisfied performance obligations will be satisfied over the next 
twelve months
.
Stock-based compensation
The Company has primarily granted restricted stock units (“RSUs”) to its employees and members of the Board of Directors under the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan (“2008 Plan”), the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (“2017 Plan”), and the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (“2018 Plan” and together with the 2008 Plan and 2017 Plan, the "Dropbox Equity Incentive Plans”). Since August 2015, the Company has granted RSUs, which have a service-based vesting condition over a 
four-year
 period vesting quarterly, as the only stock-based awards to its employees, with the exception of awards granted to its co-founder and certain executives, and has not granted any stock options to employees under the Dropbox Equity Incentive Plans. The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with RSUs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period and accounts for forfeitures in the period in which they occur.
 The Board of Directors determines the fair value of each share of underlying common stock based on the closing price of the Company's Class A common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date of the grant.

DROPBOX, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Amounts in tables are in millions except per share data, or as otherwise noted)
In December 2017, the Board of Directors approved the Company’s Co-Founder Grant, consisting of 
10.3
 million shares of Class A Common Stock in the form of RSAs which were granted to Drew Houston, the Company’s co-founder and Chief Executive Officer. This Co-Founder Grant has service-based, market-based, and performance-based vesting conditions. The Co-Founder Grant is excluded from Class A common stock issued and outstanding until the satisfaction of these vesting conditions. The Company estimated the grant date fair value of the Co-Founder Grant using a model based on multiple stock price paths developed through the use of a Monte Carlo simulation that incorporates into the valuation the possibility that certain stock price targets may not be satisfied. The first tranche of the Co-Founder Grant vested in the fourth quarter of 2021. The stock-based compensation expense for the Co-Founder Grant is recognized utilizing the accelerated attribution method over the requisite service period identified as the derived service period over which the market conditions are expected to be achieved, and is not reversed if the market conditions are not satisfied. Therefore, no incremental stock-based compensation was recognized upon vesting of these RSAs. See Note 12 "Stockholders' Deficit" for additional information.
Cost of revenue
Cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the storage, delivery, and distribution of the Company’s platform for both paying users and free users. These costs, which are referred to as infrastructure costs, include depreciation of servers located in co-location facilities that the Company leases and operates, rent and facilities expense for those datacenters, network and bandwidth costs, support and maintenance costs for infrastructure equipment, and payments to third-party datacenter service providers. Cost of revenue also includes salaries, bonuses, benefits, travel-related expenses, and stock-based compensation, which are referred to as employee-related costs, for employees whose primary responsibilities relate to supporting the Company’s infrastructure and delivering user support. Other non-employee costs included in cost of revenue include credit card fees related to processing customer transactions and allocated overhead, such as facilities, including rent, utilities, depreciation on leasehold improvements and other equipment shared by all departments, and shared information technology costs. In addition, cost of revenue includes amortization of developed technologies, professional fees related to user support initiatives, and property taxes related to the datacenters.
Reduction in Workforce
2024 Reduction in Workforce
In October 2024, the Company announced a reduction of its global workforce by approximately 
20
% to streamline the Company’s team structure to better align with its long-term growth and profitability objectives. The Company paid $
52.1
 million in cash expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2024, and estimates that it will make total cash expenditures of $
63
 million to $
68
 million, which includes the pro rata amount of the fiscal year 2024 annual employee bonus through October 30, 2024. As a result, the Company expects to recognize $
47
 million to $
52
 million of incremental expense, consisting of severance payments, employee benefits and related costs. The Company incurred substantially all of these charges in the fourth quarter of 2024, with the remainder to be recognized and paid in the first half of 2025.
These severance and related charges are included within the Company's consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 as follows:

 million, and $
94.8
 million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash
Cash consists primarily of cash on deposit with banks and includes amounts in transit from payment processors for credit and debit card transactions, which typically settle within five business days. Cash equivalents include highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity date of 90 days or less from the date of purchase. Restricted cash relates to cash collateral used to secure outstanding letters of credit primarily for the Company’s office lease agreements.
82
Table of Contents
DROPBOX, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Amounts in tables are in millions except per share data, or as otherwise noted)
The Company had restricted cash of $
32.2
 million as of December 31, 2024. The letters of credit were previously issued under the Revolving credit facility (defined in Note 8 "Debt") which was terminated in December 2024. The Company did 
not
 have any restricted cash as of December 31, 2023.
The Company monitors its credit risk by considering factors such as historical experience, credit ratings, current economic conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts.
Short-term investments 
The Company’s short-term investments are primarily comprised of corporate notes and obligations, U.S. Treasury securities, certificates of deposit, asset-backed securities, commercial paper, U.S. agency obligations, foreign government securities, supranational securities, and municipal securities. The Company determines the appropriate classification of its short-term investments at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation at each balance sheet date. The Company has classified and accounted for its short-term investments as available-for-sale securities as the Company may sell these securities at any time for use in its current operations or for other purposes, even prior to maturity. As a result, the Company classifies its short-term investments, including securities with stated maturities beyond twelve months, within current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. 
The Company's short-term investments are recorded at fair value each reporting period. Unrealized gains and losses on these short-term investments are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets until realized. Unrealized gains and losses for any short-term investments that management intends to sell or it is more likely than not that management will be required to sell prior to their anticipated recovery are recorded in other income (loss), net. The Company segments its portfolio based on the underlying risk profiles of the securities and has a zero-loss expectation for U.S. treasury and U.S. government agency securities. The Company regularly reviews the securities in an unrealized loss position and evaluates the current expected credit loss by considering factors such as credit ratings, issuer-specific factors, current economic conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts.
 The Company did not record any material credit losses during the year ended December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
no
 allowance for credit losses in short-term investments was recorded. 
Concentrations of risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and short-term investments. Although the Company deposits its cash and cash equivalents with multiple well-established financial institutions, the deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits of cash and cash equivalents and management believes that the institutions where the Company has deposits are financially stable and, accordingly, minimal credit risk exists.
Trade accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers located around the world. Two 
distribution partners accounted for

11
% and 
48
% of
 total trade and other receivables, net as of December 31, 2024. 
Two
 distribution partners accounted for

11
% and 
43
% o
f total trade and other receivables, net as of December 31, 2023. 
No customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s revenue in the periods presented.
The Company hosts its services and serves all of its users using a combination of its own custom-built infrastructure that it leases and operates in co-location facilities and third-party datacenter services such as Amazon Web Services ("AWS"). The Company's technology infrastructure, combined with select use of AWS resources, provides a distributed and scalable architecture on a global scale. The Company has designed its platform with multiple layers of redundancy to guard against data loss and deliver high availability. 
Trade and other receivables, net 
Trade and other receivables, net consists primarily of trade receivables that are recorded at the invoice amount, net of an allowance for expected credit losses. 
The allowance for expected credit losses is based on the Company’s assessment of the collectability of accounts receivable. The Company assesses collectability by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar characteristics exist and on an individual basis when the Company identifies specific customers with known disputes or collectability issues. The Company regularly reviews the adequacy of the allowance for expected credit losses by considering 
83
Table of Contents
DROPBOX, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Amounts in tables are in millions except per share data, or as otherwise noted)
the age of each outstanding invoice, the collection history of each customer, and other relevant factors, including contractual term and current and future economic conditions. The Company's allowance for expected credit losses was immaterial as of  December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
Non-trade receivables
The Company records non-trade receivables to reflect amounts due for activities outside of its subscription agreements, such as indemnification assets and receivables from tenants. Non-trade receivables totaled $
5.0
 million and $
6.9
 million, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and are classified within prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. See Note 9 "Leases" for additional information.

Deferred commissions, net
Deferred commissions, net is stated as gross deferred commissions less accumulated amortization. Deferred commissions are considered to be incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer such as sales commissions earned by the Company’s sales force including related payroll taxes and revenue share earned by strategic partners. These amounts have been capitalized as deferred commissions within prepaid and other current assets and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
 The Company deferred incremental costs of obtaining a contract of $
28.1
 million and $
24.7
 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Deferred commissions, net included in prepaid and other current assets were $
21.3
 million and $
23.4
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Deferred commissions, net included in other assets were $
21.9
 million and $
22.0
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Commissions related to new contracts are typically deferred and amortized over a period of benefit of 
five years
. The period of benefit was estimated by considering factors such as historical customer attrition rates, the useful life of the Company’s technology, and the impact of competition in its industry. Commissions that are commensurate with renewal contracts are typically amortized over 
one year
. Amortization of deferred commissions was $
30.3
 million, $
38.6
 million and $
39.5
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 respectively. Amortization of deferred commissions costs are included in sales and marketing expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. There was no impairment loss in relation to the deferred costs for any period presented.
Property and equipment, net
Equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the related asset, which is generally 
three
 to 
seven years
. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the term of the related lease. 
The following table presents the estimated useful lives of property and equipment:

Lease obligations
The Company leases office space, datacenters, and equipment under non-cancelable finance and operating leases with various expiration dates through 2036. The Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. 
Operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at commencement date. The interest rate implicit in the Company’s operating leases is not readily determinable, and therefore an incremental borrowing rate is estimated to determine the present value of future payments. The estimated incremental borrowing rate factors in a hypothetical interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms, payments, and economic environments. Operating lease right-of-use assets also include any prepaid lease payments and lease incentives.

Certain of the operating lease agreements contain rent concession, rent escalation, and option to renew provisions. Rent concession and rent escalation provisions are considered in determining the single lease cost to be recorded over the lease term. Single lease cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term commencing on the date the Company has the right to use the leased property. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. The Company generally uses the base, non-cancelable, lease term when recognizing the lease assets and liabilities, unless it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. 
In addition, certain operating lease agreements contain tenant improvement allowances from its landlords. These allowances are accounted for as lease incentives and decrease the Company's right-of-use asset and reduce single lease cost over the lease term.
As part of the Company's Virtual First strategy, Dropbox has retained a portion of its office space for in-person collaboration while the remainder will be subleased. The Company recorded total impairment charges of $
0.1
 million, $
3.6
 million and $
175.2
 million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to real estate assets as a result of changes in the corporate real estate market which impacted the Company's subleasing strategy in conjunction with the Virtual First model. See Note 9 "Leases" for additional information.
In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company executed an amendment to partially terminate the lease ("the lease amendment") for its San Francisco, California corporate headquarters. As a result of the lease amendment, the Company recognized a one-time gain of $
158.8
 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 from the corresponding remeasurement of the lease liability and adjustment of the right-of-use asset (which was previously impaired), partially offset by an increase in the liability for unrecoverable common area maintenance costs. 
The Company leases certain equipment from various third parties, through equipment finance leases. These leases either include a bargain purchase option, a full transfer of ownership at the completion of the lease term, or the terms of the leases are at least 75 percent of the useful lives of the assets and are therefore classified as finance leases. These leases are capitalized in property and equipment, net and the related amortization of assets under finance leases is included in depreciation and amortization expense in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. Initial asset values and finance lease obligations are based on the present value of future minimum lease payments.
The Company’s finance lease agreements may contain lease and non-lease components. The non-lease components include payments for support on infrastructure equipment obtained via finance leases, which when not significant in relation to the overall agreement, are combined with the lease components and accounted for together as a single lease component.

Internal use software
The Company capitalizes certain costs related to developed or modified software solely for its internal use and cloud-based applications used to deliver its platform. The Company capitalizes costs during the application development stage once the preliminary project stage is complete, management authorizes and commits to funding the project, and it is probable that the project will be completed and that the software will be used to perform the function intended. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Capitalized internal use software costs were not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.
Business combinations
The Company uses best estimates and assumptions, including but not limited to, future expected cash flows, expected asset lives, and discount rates, to assign a fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations as of the acquisition date. These estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be recorded, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.

Long-lived assets, including goodwill and other acquired intangible assets, net
The Company evaluates the recoverability of its property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such review determines that the carrying amount of specific property and equipment or intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to its fair value.
The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of its single reporting unit below its carrying value. At December 31, 2024, the single reporting unit had a negative carrying value of net assets. Goodwill allocated to the single reporting unit was $
442.8
 million at December 31, 2024.
The Company has 
not
 recorded impairment charges on goodwill or intangible assets for the periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
The Company recorded total impairment charges of $
0.1
 million, $
3.6
 million and $
175.2
 million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to real estate assets as a result of changes in the corporate real estate market which impacted the Company's subleasing strategy in conjunction with its Virtual First model. See Note 9 "Leases" for additional information.
Acquired property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives. The Company evaluates the estimated remaining useful life of these assets when events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of depreciation or amortization. If the Company revises the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized balance is amortized or depreciated over the revised estimated useful life on a prospective basis. Refer to "Change in Accounting Estimate" for additional information related to the revised useful life of certain assets in the first quarter of 2024.
Income taxes
Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of the Company’s assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply when taxes are actually paid or recovered. In addition, deferred tax assets are recorded for net operating loss and credit carryforwards.
A valuation allowance is provided against deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that they will be realized based on all available positive and negative evidence. Such evidence includes, but is not limited to, recent cumulative earnings or losses, expectations of future taxable income by taxing jurisdiction, and the carry-forward periods available for the utilization of deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2022, the Company released the valuation allowance on its U.S. federal and certain state deferred tax assets resulting in an income tax benefit of $
420.2
 million. 
The Company uses a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount, which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. 
Although the Company believes that it has adequately reserved for its uncertain tax positions, it can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. The Company evaluates its uncertain tax positions on a regular basis and evaluations are based on a number of factors, including changes in facts and circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of an audit, and effective settlement of audit issues.
To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ("TCJA") subjects a U.S. shareholder to current tax on global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI") earned by foreign subsidiaries. The Company accounts for GILTI as a period cost as incurred.

Fair value measurement
The Company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions, and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:
Level 1
—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2
—Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3
—Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

Unrealized losses on short-term investments have not been recorded into income because management does not intend to sell nor will be required to sell these securities prior to their anticipated recovery, and for which the decline in fair value is largely due to changes in interest rates. The credit ratings associated with the corporate notes and obligations are mostly unchanged, are highly rated and the issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments.
The Company recorded interest income from its cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $
39.0
 million, $
34.6
 million and $
15.7
 million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Fair Value Measurements
The Company measures its financial instruments at fair value each reporting period using a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A financial instrument’s classification within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The following table presents information about the Company’s financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using the input categories discussed in Note 1:

Note 8.
Debt
Term loan facility
During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company entered into a Credit and Guaranty Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), with certain counterparties which provided for, among other things, a secured 
five-year
 term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $
2.0
 billion, consisting of initial term loans and delayed draw term loan commitments each in an aggregate principal amount of up to $
1.0
 billion, respectively. The Credit Agreement also provides for a secured letter of credit facility in an aggregate amount of up to $
35.0
 million. The Company’s obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain material subsidiaries of the Company and are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and such subsidiary guarantors. As of December 31, 2024, there were $
1.0
 billion of term loans outstanding, measured at amortized cost. In accounting for the term loans, issuance costs of $
27.6
 million were deducted from the carrying value of the term loan in the consolidated balance sheet. Issuance costs are amortized and recognized as a component of interest expense over the 
five-year
 term using the effective interest method. Furthermore, there were $
22.6
 million and $
0.2
 million of deferred issuance costs related to the delayed draw term loan commitments and secured letter of credit facility, respectively, which will be recognized initially as deferred assets and subsequently reclassified and presented as a direct deduction to the carrying value of the related debt upon an eventual draw, and amortized over the remaining term on an effective interest method basis from the time of draw.   
The delayed draw term loan commitments of $
1.0
 billion may be borrowed, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, from the closing date of the Credit Agreement through December 11, 2026, provided that the delayed draw term loan commitments shall be reduced to $
500.0
 million as of December 11, 2025, if the undrawn delayed draw term loan commitments exceed $
500.0
 million at that date. The delayed draw term loan commitments can be drawn in increments of $
5.0
 million or greater and up to ten draws can be made. The initial term loans and the delayed draw term loans (if and when funded) shall have the same terms and shall be treated as a single fungible class of term loans for all purposes under the Credit Agreement, except that interest on any delayed draw term loan shall commence from the applicable date of draw. As of December 31, 2024, 
no
 amounts were outstanding on the delayed draw term loan commitments and 
no
 letters of credit were issued under the letter of credit facility. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company is required to pay a quarterly commitment fee that accrues at a rate of 
1.00
% per annum on the unused portion of the delayed draw term loan commitments. The 
1.00
% fee will be capitalized each reporting period, as the draw is probable as of the issuance date, and reclassified against the carrying value of the debt upon draw and amortized over the debt term on an effective interest method basis from the time of draw. As of December 31, 2024, the accrued commitment fee was $
0.6
 million.
The term loans have a maturity date of December 11, 2029 with quarterly principal payments beginning on March 31, 2025 and continuing on the last business day of each quarter thereafter, equal to 
0.25
% of the original principal amount of such term loans. In addition, the term loans are subject to mandatory prepayments upon the occurrence of certain events as defined in the Credit Agreement, including excess cash flows generated by the Company's operating activities, the proceeds of certain asset sales and the incurrence of certain indebtedness. The Company believes the occurrence of any such events is remote as of the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company is permitted to prepay the term loans at any time in whole or in part, subject to a prepayment premium equal to 
2.00
% of the aggregate principal amount prepaid on or prior to the first anniversary of the closing date and 
1.00
% of the aggregate principal amount prepaid after the first anniversary of the closing date but on or prior to the second anniversary of the closing date. Term loans repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed.
Borrowings under the term loan facility bear interest, at the Company’s option, at either (a) an alternate base rate, which is defined as a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the greatest of (i) the prime rate then in effect, (ii) the federal funds rate then in effect, plus 
0.50
% per annum, and (iii) a term SOFR rate determined on the basis of a one-month interest period plus 
1.00
% per annum, in each case, plus a margin of 
2.75
%, or (b) an overnight or term SOFR rate (based on one, three or six month interest periods), plus a margin of 
3.75
%. Interest is payable quarterly in arrears with respect to borrowings bearing interest at the alternative base rate on the last business day of an interest period, but at most monthly and at least quarterly, with respect to overnight and term SOFR rate borrowings.

Interest expense associated with the term loans for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $
5.2
 million. 
The Credit Agreement permits the Company, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including obtaining commitments from new or existing lenders, to add new term loan facilities or increase the term loan commitments under the Credit Agreement, in each case, subject to certain limits. Additionally, the term loan agreement contains customary representations and warranties, customary affirmative and negative covenants, and customary events of default. Failure to comply with these covenants may result in a portion of the outstanding term loan debt becoming due immediately. The Company was in compliance with all covenants under the term loan facility as of December 31, 2024.

Revolving credit facility
In December 2024, in connection with the Credit Agreement, the Company terminated its existing revolving credit facility and recorded a 
$
0.6
 million
 loss on debt extinguishment, which is included in other income (loss), net, for the 
year ended December 31, 2024
. T
he revolving credit facility provided for secured revolving loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $
500.0
 million, with a letter of credit sublimit of $
65.0
 million and would have matured in February 2026.
Pursuant to the terms of the revolving credit facility, the Company was required to pay an annual commitment fee that accrued at a rate of 
0.20
% per annum on the unused portion of the borrowing commitments under the revolving credit facility. In addition, the Company was required to pay a fee in connection with letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility, which accrued at a rate of 
1.375
% per annum on the amount of such letters of credit outstanding. There was an additional fronting fee of 
0.125
% per annum multiplied by the average aggregate daily maximum amount available under all letters of credit. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility accrued interest, at the Company’s option, at an annual rate based on credit spread adjusted SOFR plus a spread of 
1.375
% or at an alternative base rate plus a spread of 
0.375
%.
As part of the termination of the revolving credit facility, all remaining letters of credit were guaranteed by a single lender and secured with cash collateral, which is recorded as restricted cash and presented within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets
. The Company’s letters of credit have final expiration dates through 2036.
Convertible senior notes
During the first quarter of 2021, the Company issued $
695.8
 million aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes. Additionally, during the first quarter of 2021, the Company issued $
693.3
 million aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Notes. The Notes were issued in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933. The net proceeds from the sale of the Notes were approximately $
1.4
 billion after deducting offering and issuance costs related to the Notes.
The Notes of each series do not bear regular interest. The Notes of each series may bear special interest as the remedy relating to the Company’s failure to comply with certain of its reporting obligations. The Company has complied with these reporting obligations from the issuance date through December 31, 2024. The 2026 Notes will mature on March 1, 2026, and the 2028 Notes will mature on March 1, 2028, in each case, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Amounts in tables are in millions except per share data, or as otherwise noted)
The initial conversion rate for the 2026 Notes is 26.1458 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of such Note, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $
38.25
 per share. The initial conversion rate for the 2028 Notes is 28.2889 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of such Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $
35.35
 per share. The conversion rate for each series of Notes will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events but will not be adjusted for accrued and unpaid special interest. In addition, upon the occurrence of a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the relevant indentures governing the Notes) or a notice of redemption, the Company will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate of the relevant series of Notes by a number of additional shares for a holder that elects to convert all or a portion of its Notes of such series in connection with such make-whole fundamental change or who elects to convert such Notes that are subject to such notice of redemption. The conversion rate for the 2026 Notes and the 2028 Notes shall not exceed 43.1406 shares per $1,000 principal amount of such Notes, subject to certain customary anti-dilution adjustments (as defined in the relevant indentures governing the Notes). There have been no changes to the initial conversion price of the Notes since issuance as of December 31, 2024.
Upon conversion, the principal portion of the Notes of the applicable series being converted will be settled in cash, and any amount in excess of the principal portion of such Notes will be settled in cash or shares of the Company’s Class A common stock or any combination thereof at the Company’s option. The if-converted value of the 2026 Notes and the 2028 Notes was below the principal value of the respective series of Notes as of December 31, 2024. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2024 the conditions allowing holders of the Notes to convert during the following fiscal quarter were not met.
Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding December 1, 2025, in the case of the 2026 Notes, and prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding December 1, 2027, in the case of the 2028 Notes, the Notes of the applicable series will be convertible only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after June 30, 2021 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Class A common stock for at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the 
30
 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 
130
% of the conversion price for the relevant series of Notes on each applicable trading day; (2) during the 
five
 business day period after any 
five
 consecutive trading day period in which, for each trading day of that period, the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 2026 Notes or 2028 Notes, as applicable, for such trading day was less than 
98
% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Class A common stock and the conversion rate for such series of Notes on each such trading day; (3) if the Company calls any or all of the Notes for redemption, such Notes of the applicable series called for redemption may be converted at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions.
On or after December 1, 2025, in the case of the 2026 Notes, and on or after December 1, 2027, in the case of the 2028 Notes, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the relevant maturity date, holders of the relevant series of Notes may convert all or a portion of their Notes of such series regardless of the foregoing conditions.
The Company may redeem for cash all or any part of the Notes, at its option, on or after March 6, 2024, in the case of the 2026 Notes, and on or after March 6, 2025, in the case of the 2028 Notes, if the last reported sale price of its Class A common stock has been at least 
130
% of the conversion price for the relevant series of Notes then in effect for at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 
30
 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the series of Notes to be redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid special interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. No sinking fund is provided for the Notes.
Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the relevant indentures governing the Notes) prior to the relevant maturity date, holders of the relevant series of Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the Notes of such series for cash at a price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the series of Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid special interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. Additionally, and upon events of default (as defined in the relevant indentures governing the Notes), the maturity of the Notes may be accelerated.
The Notes are the Company’s general unsecured obligations and will rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness that is contractually subordinated to the Notes; rank equal in right of payment with the Company’s existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively rank junior in right of payment to any of the

In accounting for the Notes, issuance costs of $
11.0
 million and $
11.0
 million for the 2026 Notes and the 2028 Notes, respectively, were deducted from the carrying value of the Notes in the consolidated balance sheet. Issuance costs will be recognized as interest expense over the

Convertible Note Hedges and Warrants
Concurrent with the offering of the Notes, the Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions with certain counterparties whereby the Company had the option to purchase a total of approximately 
18.2
 million shares for note hedges expiring in March 2026 (the “2026 Note Hedges”) and 
19.6
 million shares for note hedges expiring in March 2028 (the “2028 Note Hedges”, together with the 2026 Note Hedges, the “Note Hedges”), respectively, of its Class A common stock at a price of approximately $
38.25
 and $
35.35
 per share, respectively. The aggregate cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was $
265.3
 million.
The Note Hedges, or a portion thereof, are exercisable upon conversion of the Notes and the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Note Hedges. Additionally, the Note Hedges may be terminated and early settled upon the occurrence of certain events, including certain merger events, events of default, and upon a fundamental change (as defined in the relevant indentures for the Notes). The Note Hedges are settleable in cash, shares or a combination of cash and shares, at the option of 
97
Table of Contents
DROPBOX, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Amounts in tables are in millions except per share data, or as otherwise noted)
the Company, and the settlement alternative will be the same as the settlement alternative of the conversion spread for the respective series of Notes.
The convertible note hedge transactions are expected generally to offset the potential dilution to the Class A common stock upon conversion of the relevant series of Notes and/or reduce any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of such converted Notes, as the case may be, in the event that the market price per share of the Class A common stock, as measured under the terms of the convertible note hedge transactions, is greater than the applicable strike price of those convertible note hedge transactions. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s stock price was below the exercise price of the respective Note Hedges.
In addition, the Company sold warrants to certain counterparties whereby the holders of the warrants had the option to purchase a total of approximately 
18.1
 million shares of Class A common stock underlying such warrants expiring in 2026 (the “2026 Warrants”) and 
20.1
 million shares of Class A common stock underlying such warrants expiring in 2028 (the “2028 Warrants”, together with the 2026 Warrants, the “Warrants”), respectively, at an initial strike price of $
46.36
 and $
46.36
 per share, respectively. The Company received aggregate cash proceeds of $
202.9
 million from the sale of these Warrants.
If the market price per share of the Company’s Class A common stock, as measured under the terms of the Warrants, exceeds the strike price of the Warrants, the Warrants could have a dilutive effect, unless the Company elects, subject to certain conditions, to settle the Warrants in cash. The Warrants are only exercisable on the applicable expiration dates in accordance with the terms of the Warrants. Subject to the other terms of the Warrants, the first expiration date applicable to the 2026 Warrants and to the 2028 Warrants is June 1, 2026, and June 1, 2028, respectively, and the final expiration date applicable to the 2026 Warrants and 2028 Warrants is August 10, 2026 and August 10, 2028, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s Class A common stock price was below the exercise price of the Warrants.
Taken together, the purchase of the Note Hedges and the sale of the Warrants are intended to offset potential dilution from the conversion of the 2026 Notes and the 2028 Notes and/or reduce any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of such converted Notes, as the case may be, and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from $
38.25
 per share to $
46.36
 per share and from $
35.35
 per share to $
46.36
 for the 2026 Notes and the 2028 Notes, respectively.
The Note Hedges and the Warrants are equity-classified instruments as a result of being indexed to the Company’s Class A common stock and meeting certain equity classification criteria, and the instruments will not be remeasured in subsequent periods as long as the instruments continue to meet these accounting criteria. The premium paid for the Note Hedges has been included as a net reduction to additional paid-in capital within stockholders’ deficit and the premium received for the Warrants has been included as a net increase to additional paid-in capital within stockholders' deficit.

In 2017, the Company signed a 
15
 year lease agreement for office space in San Francisco, California, to serve as its corporate headquarters which commenced in 2018. The Company's obligations under the lease are supported by a $
17.5
 million letter of credit, which is secured by cash collateral. As of December 31, 2024, the Company's remaining minimum obligation under the lease for its headquarters was $
170.7
 million, which excludes $
200.1
 million of future payments allocated to non-lease components.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company announced a Virtual First work model pursuant to which remote work has become the primary experience for all of its employees. As part of the Virtual First strategy, the Company retained a portion of its office space to be used for the Company’s team collaboration use and a portion was marketed for sublease. In connection with these changes, the Company evaluated certain of its right-of-use assets and other lease related assets including leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, and computer equipment for impairment under ASC 360.
As part of this analysis, the Company reassessed its real estate asset groups and estimated the fair value of the office space to be subleased using current market conditions. Where the carrying value of the individual asset groups exceeded their fair value, an impairment charge was recognized for the difference.
The Company recorded total impairment charges of $
0.1
 million, $
3.6
 million and $
175.2
 million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, for right-of-use and other lease related assets. 
In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company executed an amendment to the lease ("the lease amendment") for its San Francisco, California corporate headquarters, whereby the Company will surrender to the landlord approximately 
165,000
 square feet of office space and pay an aggregate of $
79.0
 million in termination payments. The surrendering of space and payment of termination fees will occur in 
three
 tranches: approximately 
52,000
 square feet and $
28.1
 million paid in October

2023 upon the execution of the lease amendment, 
54,000
 square feet and $
14.9
 million paid in June 2024, and the remaining 
59,000
 feet and $
36.0
 million paid in January 2025. 
As a result of the lease amendment, the Company remeasured its related lease liability and right-of-use asset using its estimated incremental borrowing rate as of the modification date and using a relative standalone price reallocation of total contract consideration between the lease and non-lease components of the contract. The non-lease components include common area maintenance costs, which are significant in relation to the overall agreement. The determination of the standalone price of the lease and non-lease components involved judgment and was based on assumptions including future market rent rates, free rent periods and anticipated increases to common area maintenance costs.  
As a result of the lease amendment, the Company recognized a one-time gain of $
158.8
 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 from the corresponding remeasurement of the lease liability and adjustment of the right-of-use asset (which was previously impaired), partially offset by an increase in the liability for unrecoverable common area maintenance costs. The gain is recorded within net loss (gain) on real estate assets in the consolidated statement of operations. 
The Company's remaining lease liability associated with its corporate headquarters lease was $
133.3
 million as of the year ended December 31, 2024. The liability for unrecoverable common area maintenance costs totaled $
51.7
 million and $
70.0
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The liability for unrecoverable common area maintenance costs is recorded within accrued and other current liabilities and other liabilities. 
As of December 31, 2024, the Company has $
84.0
 million in commitments for operating leases that have not yet commenced, and therefore are not included in right-of-use assets or operating lease liability. The operating leases will commence in 2025 with a lease term of  
6
 to 
7
 years.

Legal matters
From time-to-time, the Company is a party to a variety of claims, lawsuits, investigations, inquiries, and proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business, including claims of alleged infringement of intellectual property rights, regulatory matters, and commercial disputes. The Company records a liability when it believes that it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount of loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. In its opinion, resolution of pending matters is not likely to have a material adverse impact on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows, or its financial position. Given the unpredictable nature of legal proceedings, the Company bases its estimate on the information available at the time of the assessment. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability and may revise the estimate.
Indemnification
The Company’s arrangements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if its products or services infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification obligations due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims.

 years as of December 31, 2024.
Co-Founder Grant
In December 2017, the Board of Directors approved the Company's Co-Founder Grant, consisting of 
10.3
 million shares of Class A common stock in the form of RSAs which were granted to Drew Houston, the Company’s co-founder and Chief Executive Officer. This Co-Founder Grant has service-based, market-based, and performance-based vesting conditions. The Co-Founder Grant is excluded from Class A common stock issued and outstanding until the satisfaction of these vesting conditions. The Co-Founder Grant also provides the holder with certain stockholder rights, such as the right to vote the shares with the other holders of Class A common stock and a right to cumulative declared dividends. 
The Co-Founder Grant is eligible to vest over the 
ten-year
 period following the date the Company’s shares of Class A common stock commenced trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market in connection with the Company’s IPO. The Co-Founder Grant is comprised of 
nine
 tranches that are eligible to vest based on the achievement of stock price goals, each of which are referred to as a Stock Price Target, measured over a consecutive 
thirty-day
 trading period during the Performance Period. The Performance Period began on January 1, 2019. 
During the first 
four years
 of the Performance Period, no more than 
20
% of the shares subject to the Co-Founder Grant would be eligible to vest in any calendar year. After the first 
four years
, all shares are eligible to vest based on the achievement of the Stock Price Targets.
The first tranche of the Co-Founder Grant, or 
2.1
 million shares of Class A common stock, vested in the fourth quarter of 2021. The stock-based compensation expense for Mr. Houston's Co-Founder Grant is recognized utilizing the accelerated attribution method over the requisite service period identified as the derived service period over which the market conditions are expected to be achieved, and is not reversed if the market conditions are not satisfied. Therefore, no incremental stock-based compensation was recognized upon vesting of these RSAs.
The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense related to the Co-Founder Grant of $
2.4
 million and $
9.4
 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, there was 
no
 unamortized stock-based compensation expense related to the Co-Founder Grant.
Note 13.

Net Income Per Share
The Company computes net income per share using the two-class method required for multiple classes of common stock and participating securities. The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the Class A common stock and Class B common stock are substantially identical, other than voting rights. Accordingly, the Class A common stock and Class B common stock share equally in the Company’s net income and losses.
Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of the Class A and Class B common stock outstanding. 
Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of diluted common shares outstanding. The computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A common stock assumes the conversion of the Company's Class B common stock to Class A common stock, while the diluted net income per share of Class B common stock does not assume the conversion of those shares to Class A common stock. The dilutive effect of potentially dilutive common shares is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the if-converted method for the 2026 Notes and the 2028 Notes, and by application of the treasury stock method for the Company's other potentially dilutive securities.

The Company periodically evaluates the realizability of its net deferred tax assets based on all available evidence, both positive and negative. The realization of net deferred tax assets is dependent on the Company's ability to generate sufficient future taxable income during periods prior to the expiration of tax attributes to fully utilize these assets. As of December 31, 2024, the Company continues to maintain valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets in certain states and one foreign jurisdiction.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Amounts in tables are in millions except per share data, or as otherwise noted)
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $
15.8
 million of federal, $
53.7
 million of state, and $
25.2
 million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income. Of the federal net operating loss carryforwards, $
4.0
 million will begin to expire in 2032 and $
11.8
 million will carryforward indefinitely, while state net operating losses begin to expire in 2031. The foreign net operating loss carryforwards will carryforward indefinitely.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had research credit carryforwards of $
192.9
 million and $
180.0
 million for federal and state income tax purposes, respectively, of which $
102.9
 million and $
49.7
 million is the unrecognized tax benefit portion related to the research credit carryforwards for federal and state, respectively. The federal and state credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2041 and 2032, respectively. 
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $
0.5
 million of foreign tax credit carryforwards, which will carryforward indefinitely.
Under Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income may be limited. In general, an “ownership change” will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by “5-percent shareholders” that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. The Company has determined that it has experienced multiple ownership changes and, as a result, the annual utilization of its net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change attributes will be subject to limitation. However, the Company does not expect that the annual limitations will significantly impact its ability to utilize its net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards prior to expiration.
As of December 31, 2024, the balance of unrecognized tax benefits was $
162.7
 million of which $
114.6
 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate and $
48.1
 million would result in adjustment to deferred tax assets with corresponding adjustments to the valuation allowance.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefit is as follows:

The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense. As of December 31, 2024, the amount of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions was $
5.0
 million. Net interest and penalties (released)/recognized for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 was $(
1.6
) million, $
1.3
 million, and $
1.7
 million, respectively. 
It is reasonably possible that there could be changes to the amount of uncertain tax positions due to activities of the taxing authorities, settlement of audit issues, reassessment of existing uncertain tax positions, or the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations; however, the Company is not able to estimate the impact of these items at this time.
The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal, multiple states, and foreign jurisdictions. All of the Company’s tax years from 2011 and 2010 remain open for examination by the federal and state authorities, respectively, and from 2015 by foreign authorities.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Amounts in tables are in millions except per share data, or as otherwise noted)
The Company generally does not provide deferred income taxes for the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries that the Company intends to reinvest indefinitely. Should circumstances change and it becomes apparent that some or all of the undistributed earnings will no longer be indefinitely reinvested, the Company will accrue for income taxes not previously recognized. As of December 31, 2024, there was no deferred tax liability on undistributed earnings, and the Company determined the amount of undistributed deferred tax liability to be immaterial.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) and many countries have proposed to reallocate some portion of profits of large multinational companies with global revenues exceeding EUR20 billion to markets where sales arise (“Pillar One”), as well as enact a global minimum tax rate of at least 15% for multinationals with global revenue exceeding EUR750 million (“Pillar Two”), and many countries are considering or intend to adopt these proposals. In December 2022, the Council of the European Union (“EU”) formally adopted the EU Minimum Tax Directive, which would require member states to adopt Pillar Two into their domestic law, effective for fiscal years starting on or after December 31, 2023. The majority of the jurisdictions in which we operate have enacted legislation to implement Pillar Two. Other countries are actively considering changes to their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the OECD’s proposals. The enactment of Pillar Two legislation is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's effective tax rate, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. The Company will continue to monitor and reflect the impact of such legislative changes in future financial statements as appropriate.
Note 15.

Segment Information and Geographic Areas
Segment Information
The Company’s chief operating decision-maker (“CODM”), the Chief Executive Officer, manages the Company's business activities as a single operating and reportable segment at the consolidated level. Accordingly, the CODM uses consolidated net income, as reported on the consolidated statements of operations, to allocate resources as part of the annual planning process and to assess the performance of the Company's single reportable segment, primarily by monitoring actual results versus the annual plan. 
The significant expenses reviewed by the CODM are cost of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative, and stock-based compensation, as presented in the consolidated statements of operations. Cost of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses include depreciation and amortization expense, which are disclosed in Note 4 "Property and Equipment, Net" and Note 6 "Intangible Assets", respectively. Other segment items consist of interest income, net, other income (loss), net, and (provision for) benefit from income taxes, as presented in the consolidated statements of operations. 
The CODM does not evaluate segment performance using balance sheet information.
Geographic Areas
Long-lived assets and revenue by geographic region, based on the physical location of the operations recording the asset or the sale, are as follows:

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
None.
ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our Management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.
Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Our management, under the supervision of our Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
