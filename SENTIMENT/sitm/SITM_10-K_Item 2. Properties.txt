Item 2. Properties. 
Our principal executive offices are located in a leased facility in Santa Clara, California, consisting of approximately 50,400 square feet of office space under lease that expires in March 2027. This facility accommodates our principal engineering, sales, marketing, operations, finance, and administrative activities. Outside of the United States, we also lease facilities in various international locations that are used for research and development, sales, business development, operations, and administrative support. These international facilities are mainly located in  Japan, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Taiwan, Finland, India and Ukraine. We do not own any real property. We believe that our leased facilities are adequate to meet our current needs and that additional facilities will be available on commercially reasonable terms for lease to meet future needs.
