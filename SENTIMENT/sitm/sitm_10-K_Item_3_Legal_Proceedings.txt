Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
The Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The MD&A contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act that involve risks and uncertainties, which are discussed under Part I, Item 1A.
Overview
The ability to accurately measure and reference time has been essential to humankind’s greatest inventions and technological advances. Timing technology has continued to evolve over centuries, underpinning broader technological evolution and is the heartbeat of digital electronic systems. Here, timing ensures that the system runs smoothly and reliably by providing and distributing clock signals to various critical components such as central processing units, communication and interface ICs, and radio frequency components. As electronics evolve to deliver higher performance, connectivity, and intelligence, even in increasingly challenging environments, while also being more complex and size-constrained, we believe they will require more sophisticated semiconductor-based timing solutions that cannot be developed in legacy quartz crystal-based technologies.  Precision timing fills this need with the performance, power, size, and cost that is required by these applications.
We are a leading provider of Precision Timing solutions to the global electronics industry. Our Precision Timing solutions are the heartbeat of our customers’ electronic systems, providing the timing functionality that is needed for electronics to operate reliably and accurately. We provide Precision Timing solutions that are differentiated by high performance, high resilience, and high reliability, along with programmability, small size, and low power consumption. Our products have been designed into over 300 applications across our target markets, including communications, datacenter and enterprise, automotive, industrial, aerospace, mobile, IoT, and consumer. Our current solutions include various types of oscillators, as well as clock ICs and resonators. 
Our all-silicon solutions are based on three fundamental areas of technical expertise: MEMS, analog mixed-signal design, and advanced system-level integration. This expertise enables us to design silicon MEMS resonators, analog circuits, as well as systems and packaging, and bring these all together to deliver a system-level solution that synergistically solves customers’ complex timing problems. In this aspect, we believe we are different than quartz-based timing providers, who typically have expertise in designing and manufacturing resonator components, but usually outsource the analog circuit design and packaging. We also have a deep understanding of the mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties of materials, which is a key requirement for developing our proprietary MEMS processes. To maximize MEMS first-silicon success, we have also developed our own MEMS simulation tools. We are also different in that our MEMS resonators are made using semiconductor technology which has significant benefits in features, performance, manufacturing, and cost, while the quartz resonator and oscillator suppliers use quartz crystal material
Compared to traditional clock IC suppliers, we are different in that we design the resonator in-house and can integrate it into the clock IC package. Our analog/mixed-signal die are developed using industry-standard processes and deliver high levels of performance using programmable PLLs, temperature sensors, regulators, data converters, drivers and other building blocks. Unlike most clock IC vendors, we do not rely on quartz vendors to provide the quartz resonator clock reference that is required for their clock ICs to function. Our expertise creates supply chain advantages for us and most importantly, enables us to design and build complete timing systems that result in performance advantages, providing a complete solution to the customer.
Our Precision Timing solutions are designed to be resilient to harsh environmental stressors. For the communications, datacenter and enterprise market, our products provide high performance and resilience in dense, less-controlled environments that experience extreme conditions. The resilience of our products becomes an increasing advantage as equipment is placed in dense, harsh environments and moves closer to the customer with the rollout of 5G, the rapid expansion in cloudification, and deployment of hyperscale and AI datacenters. For the automotive market, our solutions can be utilized in automotive electronics, including ADAS for self-driving cars, which require increased timing accuracy. For the industrial market, our products offer programmability and high reliability for the diverse operating conditions of industrial equipment, including high temperatures, mechanical shock, and vibration. For the aerospace market, our solutions provide high reliability and lower acceleration sensitivity for end products that operate in rugged conditions. For the mobile, IoT and consumer market, our timing solutions offer high performance at optimal power consumption and size, as our customers fit more functionality into smaller devices. 
In all of these markets, the trend for increased data transfer at higher speeds and demand for lower latency continues to grow. This requires higher levels of performance in timing and synchronization. Additionally, as electronics continue to proliferate in all industries and areas of our daily life, digital devices are increasingly subjected to less

controlled environments, making resiliency ever more important. These industry trends place higher demands on timing components, escalating the importance of resilient and reliable Precision Timing.
We believe that the total timing market is approximately $10 billion in size. Since our founding, we have focused on transforming this market with compelling solutions that solve difficult timing problems. Historically, our revenue has been substantially delivered from sales of oscillator systems across our target end markets. 
In December 2023, we acquired clocking products through the acquisition of certain assets and the exclusive license to certain intellectual property from Aura Semiconductor Pvt. Ltd. and certain of its affiliated entities (together, "Aura") relating to Aura's timing business and clock products that significantly expands our presence within the clocking market. With the addition of all four categories of clock products including network synchronizers, jitter cleaners, clock generators, and buffers, we now offer a comprehensive portfolio of timing solutions.  By pairing the new SiTime clocking products with our MEMS oscillators and/or our resonators, we expect to be able to offer a more complete clock tree that is simpler to design with higher performance, and more resilient to environmental stressors with better reliability.  SiTime is now a key provider of all differentiated products in timing – oscillators, clocks, and resonators combined with depth in engineering expertise in Precision Timing solutions.
We sell our products primarily through distributors, who in turn sell to our end customers. We also sell products directly to some of our end customers. We leverage our global network of distributors to address the broad set of end markets we serve. For our largest accounts, dedicated sales personnel work with the end customer to ensure that our solutions fully address the end customer’s timing needs. Our smaller customers can select the optimum timing solution for their needs by working directly with our sales personnel or distributors or by shopping on our online store, SiTimeDirect™.
We operate a fabless business model, where we outsource manufacturing to semiconductor industry suppliers, which allows us to focus on, and excel in, the design, marketing, and sales of our products. A fabless infrastructure gives us production flexibility and the ability to scale capacity up and down to meet demand. While this model allows us to operate with lower capital expenditure investment than other semiconductor companies that own fabs, we may be required to make such investments from time to time primarily to strengthen our supply chain and optimize our costs. These investments could put downward pressure on our gross margins if demand for our products does not materialize as expected. Further, this model could also subject us to supply constraints, when demand for our products is higher than anticipated, resulting in increased costs and impacting our gross margins. Our programmable architecture also plays a key role in ensuring optimal production flexibility.  In contrast to products offered by traditional timing device suppliers, our products are batch produced and then custom programmed to customer needs, allowing us to offer shorter lead times and the ability to meet custom requirements more easily.
Since our IPO in November 2019, while our revenue has grown, gross margins have improved, and new opportunities for growth for our business have emerged, adverse macroeconomic events including geopolitical tensions and conflicts have substantially increased. In 2020 and 2021, there were a number of industry-wide supply constraints affecting the supply of analog circuits manufactured by certain foundries, including TSMC, and affecting outsourced semiconductor assembly and test providers. We believe that the effects of the industry-wide supply constraints on other timing device suppliers contributed in part to our revenue and gross margin growth in 2021 and the first half of 2022. In 2022 and 2023, macroeconomic events such as rising inflation, fear of recession, equity market volatility, geopolitical tensions, war, decreased consumer spending, lower demand for electronic products following a period of strong demand during the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and the COVID-19 pandemic measures implemented in China, harmed sales of our products and results of operations. We believe that some of our customers built up inventory of our products in 2022 to overcome the industry-wide supply constraints that occurred in the previous periods and that the macroeconomic events in the second half of 2022 and through 2023 led to reduced demand for our customers' products, which led to an inventory buildup at some of our customers and their affiliates, partners and contract manufacturers, which has adversely affected sales of our products. We believe that while this inventory buildup has reduced through the second half of 2023 and in 2024, any further increase could negatively impact the sales of our products and could result in decreases in our sales and margins, and could materially harm our results of operations. The future effects of macroeconomic events on our business and results of operations, including inventory levels at our customers and their affiliates, partners, and contract manufacturers as well as demand for our products, are uncertain and difficult to predict. For additional discussion please see Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors" of this report, especially the risk factor titled “Global macroeconomic conditions have harmed and may continue to harm our business” and “Our revenue and operating results may fluctuate from period to period, which could cause our stock price to fluctuate.”

Key Factors Affecting Our Performance
Customer Orders and Forecasts
Because our sales are made pursuant to standard purchase orders, orders may be cancelled, reduced, or rescheduled with little or no notice and without penalty. Cancellations of orders could result in the loss of anticipated sales without allowing us sufficient time to reduce our inventory and operating expenses. In addition, changes in forecasts or the timing of orders from customers exposes us to the risks of inventory shortages or excess inventory. We may not be able to fulfill increased demand, at least in the short term, as we do not intend to acquire excess inventory to pre-build custom products.
Design Wins with New and Existing Customers
Our solutions enable our customers to differentiate their product offerings and position themselves to gain market share. We work closely with our customers to understand their product roadmaps and strategies. Our end customers continuously develop new products in existing and new application areas. We also consider design wins critical to our future success and anticipate being increasingly dependent on revenue from new design wins for our new higher-end products which have higher average selling prices (“ASPs”). The selection process is typically lengthy and may require us to incur significant design and development expenditures in pursuit of a design win with no assurance that our solutions will be selected. As a result, the loss of any key design win or any significant delay in the ramp of volume production of the customer’s products into which our product is designed could adversely affect our business.
Customer Demand and Product Life Cycles
Once customers design our Precision Timing solutions into their products, we closely monitor all aspects of their demand cycle, including the initial design phase, prototype production, volume production, and inventories, as well as end-market demand, including seasonality, cyclicality, and the competitive landscape. Given our customer relationships and the long-term aspects of our solutions, we benefit from visibility into customer demand. This in turn provides an opportunity for us to monitor and refine our business fundamentals.
Product Adoption within New Markets and Applications
As we evaluate new market opportunities and bring new products to market, we pay particular attention to forecasts by industry analysts and the adoption curve of technology. We also analyze in detail potential competing forces that could hinder such adoption. If we fail to anticipate or respond to technological shifts or market demands, or to timely develop new or enhanced products or technologies in response to the same, it could result in decreased revenue and the loss of our design wins to our competitors.
Pricing, Product Cost, and Product Mix
The ASPs of our products vary significantly. While the ASP of any individual product generally decreases over time, our average ASPs have historically remained relatively flat as we continue to introduce new higher-end products with higher ASPs. Our pricing and margins depend on customer demand as well as the volumes and the features of the timing devices we provide to our customers. We continually monitor and work to reduce the cost of our products and improve the potential value our solutions provide to our customers as we target new design win opportunities and manage the product life cycles of our existing customer designs. Since we rely on third-party wafer foundries and assembly and test contractors to manufacture, assemble, and test our products, we maintain a close relationship with our suppliers to improve quality and increase yields.
Gross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of revenue, has been, and will continue to be, affected by a variety of factors, including ASPs, and product mix in a given period, material costs, yields, inventory write-downs and manufacturing operations costs. We believe the primary driver of gross margin is the ASPs negotiated between us and our customers relative to material costs and yield improvement. As our products mature and unit volumes increase, we expect their ASPs to decline. These declines often coincide with improvements in manufacturing yields and lower wafer, assembly, and testing costs, which offset some or all of the margin reduction that results from lower ASPs. However, we expect our gross margin to fluctuate on a quarterly basis as a result of changes in ASPs due to new product introductions, existing product transitions into high-volume manufacturing, manufacturing costs, and our product mix.

Cyclical Nature of the Semiconductor Industry
The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change, rapid product obsolescence, price erosion, evolving standards, short product life cycles, and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. From time to time, these factors, together with changes in macroeconomic conditions, can cause significant upturns and downturns in the semiconductor industry, and in our business. Downturns in the semiconductor industry have been characterized by diminished product demand, production overcapacity, high inventory levels, and accelerated erosion of average selling prices. Any prolonged or significant downturn in the semiconductor industry generally could adversely affect our business and reduce demand for our products and otherwise harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any significant upturn in the semiconductor industry could result in increased competition for access to third-party foundry and assembly capacity. We are dependent on the availability of this capacity to manufacture and assemble our products and we can provide no assurance that adequate capacity will be available to us in the future. We cannot predict the duration or timing of any downturn or upturn in the semiconductor industry.

Revenue
We derive revenue primarily from sales of Precision Timing solutions to distributors. We also sell products directly to some of our end customers. Our sales are made pursuant to standard purchase orders which may be cancelled, reduced, or rescheduled, with little or no notice. We recognize product revenue upon shipment when we satisfy our performance obligations as evidenced by the transfer of control of our products to customers. We measure revenue based on the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for products.

Revenue increased by $58.7 million, or 41%, for 2024 compared to 2023. The increase was primarily related to an increase in sales volume by 36% as well as an increase in ASPs of our products due to change in mix of the products we shipped. Lower sales volume in the prior year was driven by excess inventory buildup at many of our customers, distributors and their affiliates, partners, and contract manufacturers, and lower demand for our products due to macroeconomic conditions. 
Our top ten direct customers, including distributors, accounted for approximately 84%, 82% and 74% of net revenues in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Three customers each in 2024, and 2022, and four customers in 2023 which are distributors of our products, accounted for more than 10% of our net revenues. International sales,identified based upon the ship-to location of the customers who purchased the Company’s products, represented approximately 92%, 86%, and 88% of net revenues in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
Cost of Revenue, Gross Profit, and Gross Margin
Cost of revenue consists of wafers acquired from third-party foundries, assembly, packaging, and test cost of our products paid to third-party contract manufacturers, and personnel and other costs associated with our manufacturing operations. Cost of revenue also includes depreciation of production equipment, inventory write-downs, shipping and handling costs, and allocation of overhead and facility costs. We also include credits for rebates received from third-party contract manufacturers in cost of revenue.

Gross profit increased by $22.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Gross profit increased $41.2 million mainly from higher revenue. This increase was partially offset by higher amortization from acquired intangibles of $11.6 million, and higher other manufacturing and overhead costs of $6.8 million, which primarily consists of depreciation and amortization, freight and inventory reserves.
Gross margin was lower by 5% in the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was mainly due to higher amortization from acquired intangibles by 6%, partially offset by lower stock-based compensation costs by 1%.
Gross margin may fluctuate from time to time due to a variety of factors. For additional discussion please see Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors" of this report, especially the risk factor titled “Our gross margins may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, which could negatively impact our results of operations and our financial condition.”
Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative expenses, and acquisition related costs. Personnel costs are the most significant component of our operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and commissions. Our operating expenses also include consulting costs, allocated costs of facilities, information technology, and depreciation.

Research and Development
Our research and development efforts are focused on the design and development of Precision Timing solutions. Our research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs, as well as pre-production engineering mask costs, software license and intellectual property expenses, design tools and prototype-related expenses, facility costs, supplies, professional and consulting fees, and allocated overhead costs, which may be offset by non-recurring engineering contra-expenses recorded in certain periods. There is no assurance that we will have non-recurring engineering contra-expense from period to period. We expense research and development costs as incurred. We believe that continued investment in our products is important for our future growth and acquisition of new customers and, as a result, we expect our research and development expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars. However, we expect our research and development expense to fluctuate as a percentage of revenue from period to period depending on the timing of these expenses.
Research and development expense increased by $9.3 million, or 9%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $5.0 million, a decrease in non-recurring engineering contra-expense recognized of $2.3 million, and higher engineering spend towards ongoing new product development of $1.6 million.
There is no guarantee we will enter into a non-recurring engineering arrangement or recognize such contra-expense in any future period. Based on our current contracts, we expect the non-recurring engineering contra-expense to decline in future periods.
Sales, General and Administrative
Sales, general and administrative expense consists of personnel costs, professional and consulting fees, accounting and audit fees, legal costs, field application engineering support, travel costs, advertising expenses, and allocated overhead costs. We expect sales, general and administrative expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we increase our personnel and grow our operations, although it may fluctuate as a percentage of revenue from period to period depending on the timing of these expenses.
Selling, general and administrative expense increased by $18.2 million, or 22%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to higher stock-based compensation expense of $12.0 million, higher wages and bonus of $4.2 million related to increased headcount, higher sales commission payouts of $0.7 million due to higher sales, and higher travel costs of $0.6 million.
Acquisition related costs
Acquisition related costs include legal, regulatory, consulting, and other costs incurred towards the acquisition closed during the year ended December 31, 2023 and changes in the fair value of the sales-based earnout liability and interest accretion related to the acquisition consideration payable. Acquisition related costs increased by $3.0 million, or 39%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily due to accretion of acquisition consideration payable of $3.3 million and an increase in the fair value of sales-based earnout liability of $4.9 million, partially offset by a reduction in one-time acquisition costs related to the 2023 Aura transaction of $5.2 million. We will continue to incur incremental costs beyond 2024 related to the Aura transaction arising from changes in the fair value of the sales-based earnout liability and accretion of acquisition consideration payable.
Interest Income and Other Expense, net
Interest income and other expense consists primarily of interest income on our cash balances, and foreign exchange gains and losses.

Interest income and other expense, net decreased $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily related to lower interest income earned on short term investments due to lower interest rates and a decrease in investment balances arising from acquisition related payments and higher capital expenditures.
Income Tax Expense
Income tax expense consists primarily of state income taxes and income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. The income tax expense in foreign jurisdictions was higher due to increased operational activities in our foreign entities. We have a full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as the realization of the full amount of our deferred tax asset is uncertain, including net operation losses (NOL), carryforwards, and tax credits related primarily to research and development. We expect to maintain this full valuation allowance until realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more likely than not. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had federal NOL carry-forwards of approximately $250.7 million and $230.2 million, respectively, state NOL carry-forwards of approximately $84.5 million and $83.7 million, respectively, and foreign NOL carry-forwards of approximately $2.0 million and $1.7 million, respectively. These federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carry-forwards will expire beginning in 2028. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $3.9 million and $3.9 million, respectively for U.S. federal income tax purposes and $3.6 million and $3.6 million, respectively for state income tax purposes. The research and development credit carryforwards for federal tax purposes will begin to expire in 2025, and state tax credits carry forward indefinitely.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023 we held short-term investments in held-to-maturity securities of $412.7 million and $518.7 million, respectively, which consisted of Treasury Bills. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we also had cash and cash equivalents of $6.1 million and $9.5 million, respectively. Our principal use of cash is to fund our operations, to support growth through capital investments, and to acquire complementary businesses, products, services, or technologies in the future. 
In February 2024, we entered into a Sales Agreement ("Sales Agreement") with Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated ("Stifel"), under which we may offer and sell from time to time at our sole discretion, up to an aggregate of 1,200,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, through Stifel as our sales agent. The Company used the net proceeds from the shares of common stock offered and sold to replenish funds expended to satisfy tax withholding and remittance obligations related to the net settlement upon vesting of restricted stock unit awards (“RSU”) granted to employees under the equity incentive plans. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we sold 332,500 shares of our common stock under the Sales Agreement at a weighted average price of $151.91 per share resulting in net proceeds to us of $48.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs. 
Our purchase obligations primarily include design and simulation licenses. For information about our contractual obligations refer to "Note 5 - Lease" and “Note 6 – Commitments and Contingencies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
We expect to continue our investing activities to support growth, primarily through the purchase of property and equipment, intellectual property licenses, and capitalized software, to support research and development, sales and marketing, product support, and administrative staff.
We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and our short-term investments will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least the next 12 months. Over the longer term, our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of our sales and marketing and research and development expenditures, and the continuing market acceptance of our solutions. In the event that we need to borrow funds or issue additional equity, we cannot provide any assurance that any such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when we need it, it would harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Operating Activities
In 2024, net cash provided by operating activities of $23.2 million was primarily due to net loss of $93.6 million and a change in operating assets and liabilities of $25.0 million, offset by non-cash expenses of $141.8 million. Non-cash expenses were mainly related to stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, change in fair value of sales based earnout liability and acquisition consideration payable, inventory write-downs and net changes in unrealized interest on held to maturity investments. The changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in cash used for operations primarily due to higher accounts receivable due to timing of shipments, increase in inventories as we managed our inventory levels, higher prepaid expenses and other assets, partially offset by higher accrued expenses and other liabilities and higher accounts payable due to timing of payments.
In 2023, net cash provided by operating activities of $8.1 million was primarily due to a net loss of $80.5 million and a change in operating assets and liabilities of $4.3 million, offset by depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, a net change in unrealized interest on held to maturity securities, change in fair value of sales based earnout liability and acquisition consideration payable for a total of $92.9 million. The changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in cash provided primarily due to lower accounts receivable due to timing of shipments offset by an increase in inventories as we managed our inventory levels, higher prepaid expenses and other assets, lower accrued expenses and other liabilities due to timing of payments and a decrease in accounts payable.
Investing Activities
Our investing activities consist primarily of the purchase of short-term investments and capital expenditures for property and equipment purchases. Our capital expenditures for property and equipment have primarily been for general business purposes, including machinery and equipment, leasehold improvements, acquired software, computer equipment used internally, and production masks to manufacture our products.
In 2024, cash provided by investing activities was $64.8 million. We received proceeds from the maturity of held to maturity investments of $909.3 million. This was partially offset by purchases of $807.8 million of short-term investments in held-to-maturity securities, $36.2 million largely to purchase test and other manufacturing equipment to support our operations and other property and equipment for general business purposes, and $0.5 million to purchase intangible assets in software licenses.
In 2023, cash used in investing activities was $36.7 million. We paid $1,046.4 million to purchase short-term investments in held-to-maturity securities and $39.0 million for the acquisition of certain assets and the exclusive license to certain intellectual property from Aura. We paid $8.9 million largely to purchase test and other manufacturing equipment to support our operations and other property and equipment for general business purposes. We paid $3.3 million to purchase intangible assets in software licenses. All such payments were partially offset by $1,061.0 million proceeds from the maturity of held to maturity investments.
Financing Activities
Our financing activities have primarily consisted of proceeds from issuance of shares, payment of withholding of taxes on restricted stock units and payment of acquisition related consideration and earnouts. 
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we sold 332,500 shares of our common stock under the Sales Agreement resulting in net proceeds to us of $48.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $1.0 million and offering costs of $0.7 million. The net proceeds from the Sales Agreement were offset by tax withholdings 
52
Table of Contents
paid on behalf of employees for net share settlement of $52.6 million, payment towards the Aura transaction of $75.2 million and related payment of earnouts of $12.3 million.
During the year ended December 31, 2023, we sold 400,000 shares of our common stock under the Sales Agreement resulting in net proceeds to us of $44.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $0.9 million and offering costs of $0.3 million. The net proceeds from the Sales Agreement were offset by tax withholdings paid on behalf of employees for net share settlement of $41.3 million. 
Critical Accounting Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected.
The critical accounting policies requiring estimates, assumptions, and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.
Revenue Recognition
We derive our revenue from product sales primarily to distributors. We recognize product revenue, at a point in time, upon shipment when we satisfy our performance obligations as evidenced by the transfer of control of our products to customers. We measure revenue based on the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for products. Variable consideration is estimated and reflected as an adjustment to the transaction price. Depending on the terms of the contract, variable consideration is estimated using either the expected value approach or the most likely value approach. We determine variable consideration at the end of each reporting period, which consists primarily of price adjustments and product returns by estimating the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to from our customers based on historical experience. Adjustments for the variable consideration has been in the range of 2% to 3% on a quarterly basis for the current year.  Our customers have limited return rights under our contracts with them. If variable considerations are anticipated to exceed historical experience, we may adjust our sales returns allowance accordingly to properly reflect our net revenue. Since our performance obligations relate to contracts with a duration of less than one year, we do not disclose the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied at the end of the reporting period.
Business Combinations
We apply the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805), in accounting for our acquisitions. ASC 805 requires that we evaluate whether a transaction pertains to an acquisition of assets, or to an acquisition of a business. A business is defined as an integrated set of assets and activities that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. Asset acquisitions are accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisition to the individual assets and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis; whereas the acquisition of a business requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values, including in-process research and development. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. 
Our valuation of acquired assets and assumed liabilities requires significant estimates, especially with respect to intangible assets, that were derived using valuation techniques and models such as the income approach. Such models require use of significant estimates including future expected revenue, expenses, capital expenditures, and other costs, and discount rates. 
The approach to estimating an initial contingent consideration associated with the purchase price also uses similar unobservable factors such as revenue projections over the term of the contingent earn-out period, discounted for the 
53
Table of Contents
period over which the initial contingent consideration is measured, and expected volatility. Based upon these assumptions, the initial contingent consideration is then valued using a Monte Carlo simulation. 
We have used third-party qualified specialists to assist management in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. This includes assistance with the determination of economic useful lives and valuation of identifiable intangibles.
We estimate the fair value based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from our estimates. Estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date, we record certain adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Contingent consideration which are compensatory will be expensed over the required service period.  
All acquisition-related costs are accounted for as expenses in the period in which they are incurred. Contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting period using Level 3 inputs, and the change in fair value, including accretion for the passage of time, is recognized in acquisition related costs in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.
Inventories
Inventories consist of raw materials, work-in-process, and finished goods and are stated at the lower of standard cost, (which approximates actual cost on a first-in first out basis) or net realizable value. The Company reduces excess and obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable value based on management's assessment of future demand, historical usage of by product, and market conditions.  Once written-down, inventory write-downs are not reversed until the inventory is sold or scrapped.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements under Part II, Item 8 for information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
Foreign Currency Risk
Substantially all of our revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars. Our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies in which our operations are located, which is primarily in the United States and, to a lesser extent, in Malaysia, the Netherlands, France, Taiwan, Japan, Finland, Korea, Germany, Ukraine, and India. Our results of operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2024, the effect of a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchanges rates applicable to our business would not have had a material impact on our historical consolidated financial statements. We do not currently have a hedging policy with respect to foreign currency exchange risk.
Interest Rate Risk
We had cash and cash equivalents of $6.1 million as of December 31, 2024 consisting of bank deposits, money market funds, and Treasury Bills. We also had short-term investments in held-to-maturity securities of $412.7 million consisting of Treasury Bills as of December 31, 2024. Such interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. During the year ended December 31, 2024 we generated $22.9 million in interest income through our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balances.
We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure.  As of December 31, 2024, a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value and related interest income on our interest-earning instruments of $412.7 million, by an increase or decrease of approximately $2.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of SiTime Corporation
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of SiTime Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), stockholders' equity, and cash flow, for the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and schedule II (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 14, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Critical Audit Matter Description
Inventories consist of raw materials, work-in-process, and finished goods and are stated at the lower of standard cost, (which approximates actual cost on a first-in first out basis) or net realizable value. Management reduces excess and obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable value based on management’s assessment of future demand, historical usage by product, and market conditions.
We identified the estimated net realizable value of excess and obsolete inventories as a critical audit matter because of the significant estimates management makes in its demand forecast. Specifically, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of Management's estimates of forecasted demand required a high degree of auditor judgement and increased audit effort.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to management’s estimates of forecasted demand used in the estimate of the net realizable value of excess and obsolete inventories included the following, among others:
–
We tested the effectiveness of controls over the review and approval of the estimated net realizable value of excess and obsolete inventories, including controls designed to review and approve the assumptions such as expected forecasted demand by product, customer backlog, expected product lifecycles and current market conditions.
56
Table of Contents
–
We evaluated management’s ability to accurately estimate forecasted demand by comparing historical forecasts to the actual results for those periods.
–
We made inquiries of business unit managers as well as executives, sales and marketing personnel, and operations personnel about their assessment of future demand, historical usage by product, and market conditions, and compared their expectations to actual developments over the period.
–
We selected a sample of inventory products and tested the forecasted demand by comparing internal and external information such as historical usage, contracts, communications with customers and macroeconomic conditions with the Company’s forecast.
–
We considered, when relevant, the existence of contradictory evidence based on reading of internal financial and operational information used by management and the board of directors, Company press releases, and analysts' reports, as well as our observations and inquires as to changes within the business and evidence obtained through other areas of the audit.

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of SiTime Corporation (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the two years then ended, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the two years then ended
,
 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We also have audited the adjustments to the 2023 consolidated financial statements to retrospectively apply the change in accounting for ASU No. 2023-07, “Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (Topic 280)”, as discussed in Note 1. In our opinion, such adjustments are appropriate and have been properly applied. We were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the 2024 consolidated financial statements of the Company other than with respect to the adjustments and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the 2024 consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.
Basis for Opinion

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.

1. 
The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
SiTime Corporation (the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware in December 2003. The Company is a leading provider of Precision Timing solutions to the global electronics industry, providing the timing functionality that is needed for electronics to operate reliably and correctly. The Company's products have been designed to address a wide range of applications across a broad array of end markets. The Company operates a fabless business model and leverages its global network of distributors to address the broad set of end markets that it serves. 
Basis of Presentation 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). The consolidated financial statements include all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of our annual results. The Company’s fiscal year begins on January 1 of the year stated and ends on December 31 of the same year. The Company reports its results on a calendar year basis.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The significant areas requiring the use of management estimates and assumptions include fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, estimate of reserve for excess and obsolete inventories, and sales reserves. Actual results could differ materially from such estimates. Management believes that the estimates, and judgments upon which they rely, are reasonable based upon information available to them at the time that these estimates and judgments are made.
Foreign Currency Remeasurement
The Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Foreign currency assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars at the end-of-period exchange rates except for non-monetary assets and liabilities, which are measured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses denominated in non-U.S. dollars are remeasured using an average exchange rate in effect for the period. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement and transactions are included in other expense, net.
 For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, foreign currency remeasurement and transactions gains and losses resulting in a net charge of $
0.8
 million, $
0.1
 million, and $
0.1
 million, respectively.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash balances in the Company’s bank checking and savings accounts and liquid short-term investments with original maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase, readily convertible to known amounts of cash.
Fair Value Measurements
The Company determines fair value measurements used in its consolidated financial statements based upon the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between (i) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs), and (ii) an entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs).
65
Table of Contents
The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:
Level 1:    Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access.
Level 2:    Valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3:    Valuations based on inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
Cash equivalents
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, highly liquid money market funds of $
0.3
 million and $
0.4
 million, respectively, were valued using Level 1, of the fair value hierarchy, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and are included in cash equivalents. 
Short-term investments in held-to-maturity securities
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had purchased Treasury Bills with maturities ranging from 
3
 to 
6
 months, which the Company intends to hold until maturity and has classified as held-to-maturity securities. The held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost totaling $
412.7
 million including gross accrued interest of $
4.3
 million. As of December 31, 2024, the fair value and gross unrealized gain on the held-to-maturity securities was $
412.9
 million and $
0.2
 million respectively. The carrying value of the Company's investments is reviewed quarterly for changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events that suggests an investment may not be fully recoverable. These Treasury Bills were valued using Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets, and are included in short-term investments. 
As of December 31, 2023, the Company had purchased Treasury Bills with maturities ranging from 
3
 to 
12
 months, which the Company held until maturity and classified as held-to-maturity securities. The held-to-maturity securities were recorded at amortized cost totaling $
518.7
 million including gross accrued interest of $
8.9
 million. As of December 31, 2023, the fair value and gross unrealized gain on the held-to-maturity securities was $
519.0
 million and $
0.3
 million respectively. The carrying value of the Company's investments is reviewed quarterly for changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events that suggests an investment may not be fully recoverable. These Treasury Bills were valued using Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets, and are included in short-term investments. 
Sales based earnout liability
The estimated fair value of the sales based earnout liability is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model using significant unobservable fair value inputs and is therefore classified as a Level 3 measurement.  The assumptions used in the calculation are based on the revenue projections over the term of the contingent earn-out period, expected volatility, and discount rate. The estimates of fair value are uncertain and changes in any of the estimated inputs used as of the date of this report will result in significant adjustments to the fair value. As of December 31, 2024, the Company used a volatility rate of 
20
%, risk-free rate ranging from 
4.1
% to 
4.4
%, and an expected term ranging from 
0.1
 years to 
3.9
 years.
The following table sets forth a summary of the changes in the fair value of the Company’s Level 3 financial liabilities:

Accounts Receivable and Allowances for Credit Losses
Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount, net of allowances for credit losses. An allowance for credit losses is recorded when it is probable that amounts will not be collected based on historical collection trends, age of outstanding receivables, specific customer circumstances, existing economic conditions and future forecasted information. The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and generally requires no collateral from its customers. Losses have not been significant in any of the periods presented.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable. Substantially all of the Company's cash and cash equivalents balances are in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits with financial institutions.  Investment policies have been implemented that limit purchases of marketable debt securities to investment-grade securities.
The Company extends credit based on an evaluation of the customer’s financial condition and collateral is not typically required. The Company primarily sells its products through third-party distributors.

Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost (which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. The Company reduces excess and obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable value based on management’s assessment of future demand, historical usage by product, and market conditions. Inventory reserve write-downs, once established, are not released until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped.

Table of Contents
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation. 
Depreciation of property and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows:
Lab and manufacturing equipment
3
 to 
7
 years
Computer equipment
3
 years
Furniture and fixtures
5
 years
Leasehold improvements
Shorter of remaining lease term or estimated useful lives of the assets
Maintenance and repair costs are charged to expense as incurred, and expenditures that extend the useful lives of assets are capitalized. Upon retirement or sale of the property and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the balance sheet and the resulting gain or loss is recorded in operating expenses.
Intangible Assets
Purchased intangible assets with finite lives are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets of 
3
 to 
10
 years. Acquisition-related in-process research and development represents the fair value of incomplete research and development projects that have not reached technological feasibility as of the date of acquisition. Initially, these assets are not subject to amortization. Assets related to projects that have been completed are transferred to developed technology, which are subject to amortization.
Leases
The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Lease classification is evaluated at commencement and, as necessary, at modification. Operating lease related balances are included in right-of-use (“ROU”), assets, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and other non-current liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.  The Company currently does 
no
t have any finance leases.
Operating lease right-of-use assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and operating lease liabilities represent the present value of the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.   Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is the incremental borrowing rate of the Company, because the interest rates implicit in most of its leases are not readily determinable. The incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, and in economic environments where the leased asset is located. Operating lease right-of-use assets also include adjustments related to lease incentives, prepaid or accrued rent and initial direct lease costs. Operating lease right-of-use assets are subject to evaluation for impairment or disposal on a basis consistent with other long-lived assets.
Lease terms may include periods under options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. The Company generally uses the base, non-cancelable lease term when determining the lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Operating lease cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The Company has elected the practical expedient within ASC Topic 842 to account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.  Additionally, the Company has elected the short-term lease exception for all classes of assets and does not recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term of 12 months or less and recognizes lease payments for short-term leases as expense either straight-line over the lease term or as incurred depending on whether the lease payments are fixed or variable. These elections are applied consistently for all leases.  Payments under the Company's lease arrangements are primarily fixed, however, certain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities. Variable lease payments are primarily comprised of common area maintenance charges and utility costs.

Table of Contents
Business Combinations
The Company applies the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805), in accounting for acquisitions. ASC 805 requires that the Company evaluates whether a transaction pertains to an acquisition of assets, or to an acquisition of a business. A business is defined as an integrated set of assets and activities that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. Asset acquisitions are accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisition to the individual assets and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis; whereas the acquisition of a business requires the Company to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the business acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.   The Company also evaluates all contingent consideration arrangements to determine if the arrangements are compensatory in nature. No liability is recognized at the acquisition date for arrangements concluded to be compensatory. While the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the business acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration, where applicable, the estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. 
Estimates and assumptions relevant to the determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed include, but are not limited to, revenue projections, discount rates, and other assumptions. The approach to estimating an initial contingent consideration associated with the purchase price also uses similar unobservable factors such as revenue projections over the term of the contingent earn-out period, discounted for the period over which the initial contingent consideration is measured and expected volatility. Based upon these assumptions, the initial contingent consideration is then valued using a Monte Carlo simulation.  
As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date, the Company may record certain adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of a business acquisition’s measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the consolidated statements of operations. In the event an acquisition involves an entity with which the Company has a preexisting relationship, the Company will recognize a gain or loss, if any, to settle that relationship as of the acquisition date within the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. 
All acquisition-related costs are accounted for as expenses in the period in which they are incurred. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements that are not measurement period adjustments are recognized in earnings.
Impairment of Goodwill, Intangible Assets, and Other Long-Lived Assets
Goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of the Company's fiscal year, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. The Company has elected to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of its single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative impairment test will be performed. Under the quantitative impairment test, if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, the Company will recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess but limited to the total amount of goodwill.
The Company evaluates events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of purchased intangible assets and other long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, it assesses the recoverability of these assets or asset groups by determining whether or not the carrying amount will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset or asset group, the Company records an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group.
The Company did not recognize any impairment losses on its goodwill, intangible assets, or other long-lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.
Warranty
The Company provides limited lifetime warranty coverage on all of its products by guaranteeing that all timing components from the Company will be free from defects in workmanship and materials and will conform to specifications for the life of the system. This assurance-type warranty is not considered a separate performance obligation, and thus no transaction price is allocated to it. The Company records the warranty costs in cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). The warranty reserve is calculated using historical claim information to project future warranty claims activity and is recorded within accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets based on the expected timing of the related payments.

69
Table of Contents
To date, the Company has had negligible warranty claims for any defective products, and hence the warranty reserve balances as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was not significant for any periods presented.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided in order to reduce the deferred tax assets to a level which, more likely than not, will be realized.
While the Company believes it has adequately reserved for its uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made.
The Company recognizes tax positions in the consolidated financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority. Liabilities are established for differences between positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The Company reports interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions, if any, in the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). To the extent that accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately become payable, amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall provision for income taxes in the period that such determination is made.
Revenue Recognition
The Company derives revenue from its product sales primarily to distributors, who in turn sell to original equipment manufacturers or other end customers. The Company recognizes product revenue, at a point in time, upon shipment when it satisfies its performance obligations as evidenced by the transfer of control of its products to customers. The Company measures revenue based on the amount of consideration it expects to be entitled to in exchange for products. Variable consideration is estimated and reflected as an adjustment to the transaction price. Depending on the terms of the contract, variable consideration is estimated using either the expected value approach or the most likely value approach. The Company determines variable consideration, which consists primarily of price adjustments and product returns by estimating the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive from its customers based on historical experience of price adjustments and product returns. Changes to the Company’s estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented. Since the Company’s performance obligations relate to contracts with a duration of less than one year, it does not disclose the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied at the end of the reporting period.
The Company’s payment terms vary by contract type and type of customer and generally range from 
30
 to 
60
 days from shipment. The Company has also elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over the products sold passes to customers and revenue is recognized.
As a practical expedient, the Company records the incremental costs of obtaining a contract, consisting primarily of sales commissions, when incurred because the amortization period is 
one year
 or less. These costs are recorded within selling, general, and administrative expenses.

Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue consists of wafers acquired from third-party foundries, assembly, packaging, and test cost of the Company’s products paid to third-party contract manufacturers, and personnel and other costs associated with the manufacturing operations of the Company. Cost of revenue also includes depreciation of production equipment, inventory write-downs, shipping and handling costs, and allocation of overhead and facility costs. The Company also includes credits for rebates received from third-party contract manufacturers in cost of revenue.

Table of Contents
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development costs consist primarily of personnel cost, material cost, and facilities related expenses, incurred in the course of planned research and development of new products. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
Non-recurring engineering services
The Company has certain contracts to provide non-recurring engineering (NRE) services for research and development arrangements through 2024, which do not meet the requirement to be accounted for under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Company recognizes the payments received under these NRE arrangements as liabilities and recognizes them as an offset to research and development expense as the Company achieves the milestones of the contract. As the progress towards completion occurs, the Company uses an input method based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to total estimated costs of the project. Judgment is required to estimate the remaining effort to complete the project. These estimates are reassessed throughout the term of the arrangement.
 There was no liability outstanding in relation to such arrangements as of December 31, 2024. A liability of $
1.0
 million was recorded as accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded $
1.5
 million, $
3.9
 million and $
9.0
 million, respectively as a reduction of research and development expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. 
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel costs, field application engineering support, travel costs, professional and consulting fees, accounting and audit fees, legal, advertising expenses, and allocated overhead costs. Selling, general and administrative costs are expensed as incurred.
 Advertising expenses were $
1.5
 million, $
1.6
 million and $
2.3
 million, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company grants restricted stock unit awards (“RSUs”) of its own common stock.  Compensation expense related to share-based transactions is measured at fair value on the grant date. The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense for awards with only service conditions on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.
Stock-based compensation expense for performance-based restricted stock unit awards ("PRSU") is recognized when it becomes probable that the performance conditions will be met. The Company amortizes stock-based compensation expense for PRSUs using the graded-vesting method over the requisite performance period. The Company recognizes the expense related to the multi-year performance based restricted stock unit awards ("MYPSU") on a graded-vesting method over the requisite service period. 
The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur.
Net Income (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders
Basic net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing the net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, without consideration for potentially dilutive securities. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive securities outstanding for the period. Refer to "Note 3 - Net Income (Loss) Per Share" for further discussion regarding potentially dilutive and anti-dilutive securities.

Comprehensive Income (Loss)
The Company has no components of other comprehensive income loss. Therefore, net income (loss) equals comprehensive income (loss) for all periods presented.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted
In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740). The ASU requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as additional information on income taxes paid. The ASU is effective on a prospective basis for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is also permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. This ASU will likely result in the required additional disclosures being included in our consolidated financial statements, once adopted.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses (Subtopic 220-40). The ASU requires the disaggregated disclosure of specific expense categories, including purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, and amortization, within relevant income statement captions. This ASU also requires disclosure of the total amount of selling expenses along with the definition of selling expenses. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. Adoption of this ASU can either be applied prospectively to consolidated financial statements issued for reporting periods after the effective date of this ASU or retrospectively to any or all prior periods presented in the consolidated financial statements. Early adoption is also permitted. This ASU will likely result in the required additional disclosures being included in our consolidated financial statements, once adopted. We are currently evaluating the provisions of this ASU.
Recently adopted accounting pronouncements
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, “Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (Topic 280)” in order to require disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis for all public entities. The ASU expands public entities’ segment disclosures by requiring disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, an amount and description of its composition for other segment items and interim disclosures of a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets. The ASU is to be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements and is effective for our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, and interim periods thereafter. The Company adopted this guidance with no material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  Refer to "Note 11 - Segment Information and Operations by Geographic Area" for further details.

Potential dilutive securities include dilutive common shares from share-based awards attributable to the assumed exercise of vested restricted stock units using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, potential common shares outstanding are not included in the computation of diluted net income per share if their effect is anti-dilutive.
Anti-dilutive potential shares from share-based awards are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share if either their exercise price exceeded the average market price during the period or the share-based awards were determined to be anti-dilutive based on applying the treasury stock method. During the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 the Company had 
620,889
, 
1,078,089
, and 
309,963
 potential shares from share-based awards that are anti-dilutive, respectively. Anti-dilutive potential shares from share-based awards are excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share for the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 due to the net losses reported in this period.

Commitments and Contingencies
Purchase Commitments
The Company purchases components from a variety of suppliers and uses several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for its products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and to help ensure adequate component supply, the Company enters into agreements with the Company’s contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by the Company. A portion of the Company’s reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements consists of firm, non-cancelable purchase commitments. In certain instances, these agreements allow the Company the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust the Company’s requirements based on its business needs prior to when production starts. However, in situations where the Company is unable to cancel, reschedule, or adjust the purchase commitment due to changing customer demand, excess inventories could result in material inventory provisions. 
Total future non-cancelable purchase commitments as of December 31, 2024 were as follows:

Indemnification
The Company is a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which it may be obligated to indemnify other parties to such agreements with respect to certain matters. Typically, these obligations arise in the context of contracts that the Company has entered into, under which the Company customarily agrees to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations and covenants or terms and conditions related to such matters as the sale and/or delivery of its products, title to assets sold, certain intellectual property claims, defective products, specified environmental matters, and certain income taxes. Further, the Company’s obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time, amount, or the scope of its responsibility and in some instances, the Company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made under these agreements. It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these agreements due to the conditional nature of the Company’s obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, the Company has had no material indemnification claims under these agreements.

Table of Contents
Legal Matters
From time to time, the Company may be a party to various litigation claims in the normal course of business. Legal fees and other costs associated with such actions are expensed as incurred. The Company assesses, in conjunction with legal counsel, the need to record a liability for litigation and contingencies. Accrual estimates are recorded when and if it is determined that such a liability for litigation and contingencies are both probable and reasonably estimable.
7. 
Stockholders’ Equity
The Company’s certificate of incorporation, as amended and currently in effect, authorizes the Company to issue 
200,000,000
 shares of common stock and 
10,000,000
 shares of preferred stock, par value $
0.0001
 per share. Each share of common stock is entitled to 
one

1,200,000
 shares of its common stock, par value $
0.0001

The Company has filed a prospectus supplement pursuant to the Sales Agreement for the offer and sale of up to an aggregate of 
1,200,000
 shares of its common stock. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Sales Agreement, Stifel will sell the common stock from time to time, based upon instructions from the Company. The Company agreed to pay Stifel a commission of up to

Stock-based Compensation
SiTime Corporation 2019 Stock Incentive Plan
The SiTime Corporation 2019 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”) provides for the grant of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, stock appreciation rights, performance stock awards, and other forms of equity compensation (collectively, “stock awards”), and cash awards, all of which may be granted to employees (including officers), directors, and consultants or affiliates. Awards granted under the 2019 Plan vest at the rate specified by the plan administrator, for restricted stock unit awards primarily within the quarter up to 
five years
. As of December 31, 2024, 
1.8
 million shares were available for future issuance.
SiTime Corporation 2022 Inducement Award Plan
The SiTime Corporation 2022 Inducement Award Plan (the "2022 Plan"), which initially reserved 
250,000
 shares of the Company's common stock, provides for the grant of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, stock appreciation rights, and other forms of equity compensation and cash awards, all of which may be granted to employees (including officers). Awards granted under the 2022 Plan vest at the rate specified by the plan administrator, for restricted stock unit awards primarily over 
one
 to 
four years
. In February 2023, the Company amended and restated the 2022 Plan to reserve an additional 
250,000
 shares of the Company's common stock. As of December 31, 2024, 
118,418
 shares were available for future issuance.
Bonus and Retention Plans
On August 4, 2020, the Compensation Committee of the Company adopted and approved the Executive Bonus and Retention Plan (the "Bonus and Retention Plan"). In January and August 2022, the Compensation Committee approved target bonus amounts and performance goals for the first half and second half, respectively, of the fiscal year 2022 (the “2022 Goals”). In January 2023 and March 2024, the Compensation Committee approved target bonus amounts and performance goals for the fiscal year 2023 (the “2023 Goals”) and fiscal year 2024 (the "2024 Goals"), respectively. The 
78
Table of Contents
2022 Goals, 2023 Goals, and 2024 Goals are based on the achievement of revenue and Non-GAAP operating profit, as well as individual performance goals. The awards for the actual payouts are granted in the quarter following the end of the performance period and vest as per the Compensation Committee approval. The target bonuses were granted based on a fixed dollar amount to be settled in RSUs on the vesting date and hence the awards have been classified as liability-based awards until settled. Such expense is included in the non-cash adjustment within stock-based compensation expense on the consolidated cash flow statements. The liability of $
5.4
 million for the 2024 Goals was recorded as accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024. Actual payouts ranged from 
44
% to 
130
% of target for the 2022 Goals, ranged from 
0
% to 
45
% of target for the 2023 Goals, and ranged from 
170
% to 
200
% of target for the 2024 Goals, in each case based on performance.
In April 2022, the Company adopted a bonus plan for certain employees. The target bonuses are granted based on a fixed dollar amount to be settled in RSUs in the quarter following the end of the performance period. Due to the fixed dollar amount targets, the awards have been classified as liability-based awards until settled. Once settled, these awards are reflected as RSUs granted in the table below. Such expense is included in the non-cash adjustment within stock-based compensation expense on the consolidated cash flow statements and was $
4.6
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. The liability of $
1.1
 million was recorded as accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024.
In February 2022, the Compensation Committee of the Company approved and granted to certain of the Company’s executive officers MYPSUs with vesting based on achievement of stock price targets, which are measured based on the 60-trading day average per share closing price of the Company’s common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market during the performance periods of up to 
six years
 from the date of grant, subject to the continued service of the grantee through the vest date. The grant-date fair value of each MYPSU was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation included expected volatility of 
44.4
%, risk free rate of 
1.83
%, 
no
 expected dividend yield, expected term of 
six years
 and possible future stock prices over the performance period based on historical stock and market prices. The Company recognizes the expense related to the MYPSUs on a graded-vesting method over the requisite service period.  To date, 
no
 MYPSUs have vested.
In February 2023 and March 2023, the Compensation Committee of the Company approved PRSUs for the year 2023 with performance goals based on the achievement of revenue over a 
one year
 performance period (the “PRSU 2023 Goals”) and achievement of relative total stockholder return with a 
two year
 performance period (the "2023 TSR PRSU Goals"). The grant-date fair value of each PRSU with 2023 TSR PRSU Goals was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation included expected volatility of 
84.0
% and 
83.8
%, risk free rate of 
4.67
% and 
4.05
%, 
no
 expected dividend yield, and expected term of 
1.9
 years and 
1.8
 years for the awards approved in February 2023 and March 2023, respectively. The Company recognizes the expense related to the PRSUs with PRSU 2023 Goals and PRSUs with 2023 TSR PRSU Goals on a graded-vesting method over the requisite performance period. These grants are included in the PRSU awards granted in the table below.
In March 2024 and August 2024, the Compensation Committee of the Company approved PRSUs for the fiscal year 2024 with performance goals based on the achievement of relative total stockholder return with a 
two year
 and a 
three year
 performance period (the "2024 TSR PRSU Goals"). The grant-date fair value of each PRSU was determined using Monte Carlo simulation model. The assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation for the March 2024 awards included expected volatility of 
74.7
%, risk free rate of 
4.5
%, 
no
 expected dividend yield and expected term of 
2.8
 years. The assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation for the August 2024 awards included expected volatility ranging from 
60.5
% to 
71.9
%, risk free rate ranging from 
3.9
% to 
4.3
%, 
no
 expected dividend yield and expected term ranging from 
1.4
 years to 
2.4
 years. The Company recognizes the expense related to the 2024 TSR PRSU Goals on a graded-vesting method over the requisite performance period. These grants are included in the PRSU awards granted in the table below.

The reported amount of income tax expense differs from an expected amount based on statutory rates primarily due to the Company’s valuation allowance.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, based on the available objective evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be realized. Accordingly, management has applied a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2024 and 2023.
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company has federal net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $
250.7
 million and $
230.2
 million, respectively, and state net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $
84.5
 million and $
83.7
 million, respectively. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards for foreign income tax purposes of approximately $
2.0
 million and $
1.7
 million, respectively. These federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carry-forwards will expire beginning in 2028.
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company also has federal research and development tax credit carry-forwards of approximately $
3.9
 million and $
3.9
 million, respectively, and state research and development tax credit carry-forwards of approximately $
3.6
 million and $
3.6
 million, respectively. The federal tax credits begin to expire in 2025, and the California tax credits carry forward indefinitely.
82
Table of Contents
Utilization of the net operating loss carry-forwards and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“the Code”), and similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had $
2.5
 million and $
2.3
 million of total unrecognized tax benefits. The Company currently has a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets which would impact the timing of the effective tax rate benefit should any of these uncertain tax positions be favorably settled in the future. If the Company is able to eventually recognize these uncertain tax positions, none of the unrecognized benefit would reduce the Company’s effective tax rate due to full valuation allowance of the Company’s deferred tax assets. The Company’s policy is to record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had immaterial amounts related to the accrual of interest and penalties.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending unrecognized tax benefit amount is as follows:

These amounts are related to certain deferred tax assets with a corresponding valuation allowance. As of December 31, 2024, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, that would affect the effective tax rate is $
0.5
 million. The Company does not anticipate a material change to our unrecognized tax benefits over the next twelve months. Unrecognized tax benefits may change during the next twelve months for items that arise in the ordinary course of business.
The Company does not have any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease within 12 months of the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
The Company files tax returns as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by federal, state, local, and foreign jurisdictions, where applicable. Due to the Company’s net losses, its federal, state and local, and foreign tax returns since inception are subject to audit.
10. 
401(k) Plan
The Company has a 401(k) retirement plan for the U.S. based employees that qualifies as a defined contribution plan. All U.S. based employees are eligible to participate on the first day of the month following their hire date with the Company. Under the defined contribution plan, employees may contribute up to the lesser of 
90
% of their pre-tax salaries per year or the maximum contribution allowed under the Code. The Company may make discretionary matching contributions, if deferral contributions are made by the employees. The Company’s matching contributions for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 resulted in expense of $
1.4
 million, $
1.3
 million, and $
1.3
 million respectively.
In addition, other eligible employees outside of the U.S. receive retirement benefits under various statutory plans.  Expenses under the Company's statutory plans were not material for any of the periods presented.
11. 
Segment Information and Operations by Geographic Area
The Company operates in 
one
 reportable segment related to the design, development, and sale of silicon timing systems solutions. The chief operating decision maker for the Company is the Chief Executive Officer (the "CEO"). The Company’s CEO reviews operating results on an aggregate basis and manages the Company’s operations as a whole for the purpose of evaluating financial performance and allocating resources. Accordingly, the Company has determined that it has a single reportable and operating segment structure.
83
Table of Contents
The CEO uses aggregate net income to allocate resources (including employees, financial, or capital resources) in the annual budgeting and forecasting process and uses that measure as a basis for evaluating financial performance quarterly by comparing the actuals with historical budgets.
The accounting policies of the Company’s single segment are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies within Note 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The CEO assesses performance for the Company and decides how to allocate resources based on net income that is also reported on the consolidated income statement as net income (loss). The measure of segment assets is reported on the consolidated balance sheets as total assets.
The table below provides information about the Company’s revenue, significant segment expenses and other segment expenses.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
.
We maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15 (e) and 15d – 15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report and is incorporated herein by reference.
Remediation of Prior Material Weakness
As initially disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 26, 2024, management previously identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting due to a deficiency in the review control over the classification of cash flows from investments within the statements of cash flows in accordance with applicable accounting guidance for the periods ended March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023, and September 30, 2023.  Management has since completed implementation of all the remedial measures outlined in its remediation plan as well as testing of the applicable remediated controls.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting;

Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm.

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO. Based on our evaluation under the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO, our management concluded our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of SiTime Corporation
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of SiTime Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB)
,
 the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024 , of the Company and our report dated February 14, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
