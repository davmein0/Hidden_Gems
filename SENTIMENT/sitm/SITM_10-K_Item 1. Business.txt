Overview
The ability to accurately measure and reference time has been essential to humankind’s greatest inventions and technological advances. Timing technology has continued to evolve over centuries, underpinning broader technological evolution and is the heartbeat of digital electronic systems. Here, timing ensures that the system runs smoothly and reliably by providing and distributing clock signals to various critical components such as central processing units, communication and interface ICs, and radio frequency components. As electronics evolve to deliver higher performance, connectivity, and intelligence, even in increasingly challenging environments, while also being more complex and size-constrained, we believe they will require more sophisticated semiconductor-based timing solutions that cannot be developed in legacy quartz crystal-based technologies.  Precision timing, a category that SiTime created ("Precision Timing") fills this need with the performance, power, size, and cost that is required by these applications.
We are a leading provider of Precision Timing solutions to the global electronics industry. Our Precision Timing solutions are the heartbeat of our customers’ electronic systems, providing the timing functionality that is needed for electronics to operate reliably and accurately. We provide Precision Timing solutions that are differentiated by high performance, high resilience, and high reliability, along with programmability, small size, and low power consumption. Our products have been designed into over 300 applications across our target markets, including communications, datacenter and enterprise, automotive, industrial, aerospace, mobile, internet of things (“IoT”), and consumer. Our current solutions include various types of oscillators, as well as clock integrated circuits (“ICs”) and resonators. 
Our all-silicon solutions are based on four fundamental areas of technical expertise: micro-electro-mechanical systems (“MEMS”), analog mixed-signal design, and advanced system-level integration and software. This expertise, along with the knowledge of our customers' systems, gives our products a significant edge as we address customers’ complex timing problems. In this aspect, we believe we are different than quartz-based oscillator and resonator providers, who typically have expertise in designing and manufacturing resonator components, but usually outsource the analog circuit design and packaging. We also have a deep understanding of the mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties of materials, which is a key requirement for developing our proprietary MEMS processes. To maximize MEMS first-silicon success, we have also developed our own MEMS simulation tools. We are also different in that our MEMS resonators are made using semiconductor technology which has significant benefits in features, performance, manufacturing, and cost, while the quartz resonator and oscillator suppliers use quartz crystal material. 
We believe we are different from the traditional clock IC suppliers too.  While they typically rely on quartz timing companies to obtain a discrete resonator that resides on the board, our clock solutions integrate such a resonator, and deliver a complete solution to the customer, one that has performance and integration benefits.
Our Precision Timing solutions are designed to be resilient to harsh environmental stressors. For the communications, datacenter and enterprise market, our products provide high performance and resilience in dense, less-controlled environments that experience extreme conditions. The resilience of our products becomes an increasing advantage as equipment is placed in dense, harsh environments and moves closer to the customer with the rollout of 5G, the rapid expansion in cloudification, and deployment of hyperscale and artificial intelligence ("AI") datacenters. For the automotive market, our solutions can be utilized in automotive electronics, including advanced driver assistance systems (“ADAS”) for self-driving cars, which require increased timing accuracy. For the industrial market, our products offer programmability and high reliability for the diverse operating conditions of industrial equipment, including high temperature, mechanical shock, and vibration. For the aerospace market, our solutions provide high reliability and lower acceleration sensitivity for end products that operate in rugged conditions. For the mobile, IoT and consumer market, our timing solutions offer high performance at optimal power consumption and size, as our customers fit more functionality into smaller devices. 
In all of these markets, the trend for increased data transfer at higher speeds and demand for lower latency continues to grow. This requires higher levels of performance in timing and synchronization. Additionally, as electronics continue to proliferate in all industries and areas of our daily life, digital devices are increasingly subjected to less controlled environments, making resiliency ever more important. These industry trends place higher demands on timing components, escalating the importance of resilient and reliable Precision Timing.
We believe that the total timing market is approximately $10 billion in size.  Since our founding, we have focused on the portion of the market that concentrates on delivering compelling solutions to solve difficult timing problems. Historically, our revenue has been substantially delivered from sales of oscillator systems across our target end markets.

In December 2023, we acquired clocking products through the acquisition of certain assets and the exclusive license to certain intellectual property from Aura Semiconductor Pvt. Ltd. and certain of its affiliated entities (together, "Aura") relating to Aura's timing business and clock products that significantly expands our presence within the clocking market. With the addition of all four categories of clock products including network synchronizers, jitter cleaners, clock generators, and buffers, we now offer a comprehensive portfolio of timing solutions.  By pairing the new SiTime clocking products with our MEMS oscillators and/or our resonators, we expect to be able to offer a more complete clock tree that is simpler to design with higher performance, and more resilient to environmental stressors with better reliability.  SiTime is now a key provider of all differentiated products in timing – oscillators, clocks, and resonators combined with depth in engineering expertise in Precision Timing solutions.
We sell our products primarily through distributors, who in turn sell to our end customers. We also sell products directly to some of our end customers. We leverage our global network of distributors to address the broad set of end markets we serve. For our largest accounts, dedicated sales personnel work with the end customer to ensure that our solutions fully address the customer’s timing needs. Our smaller customers can select the optimum timing solution for their needs by working directly with our sales personnel or distributors or by shopping on our online store, SiTimeDirect™.
We operate a fabless business model, where we outsource manufacturing to semiconductor industry suppliers, which allows us to focus on, and excel in, the design, marketing, and sales of our products. A fabless infrastructure gives us production flexibility and the ability to scale capacity up and down to meet demand. While this model allows us to operate with lower capital expenditure investment than other semiconductor companies that own fabrication plants ("fabs"), we may be required to make such investments from time to time primarily to strengthen our supply chain and optimize our costs. These investments could put downward pressure on our gross margins if demand for our products does not materialize as expected. Further, this model could also subject us to supply constraints, when demand for our products is higher than anticipated, resulting in increased costs and impacting our gross margins. Our programmable architecture also plays a key role in ensuring optimal production flexibility. In contrast to products offered by traditional timing device suppliers, our products are batch produced and then custom programmed to customer needs, allowing us to offer shorter lead times and the ability to meet custom requirements more easily.
Industry Background
Key Building Blocks of Timing Solutions
Timing solutions are comprised of three key product types: resonators, oscillators, and clock ICs. 
•
Resonators are mechanical structures that vibrate at a precise frequency and provide the core accuracy and stability in oscillator systems. We create resonators in silicon using MEMS semiconductor technology, which is different than the quartz industry where the resonators are made from quartz crystals and are generally manufactured in non-semiconductor technologies.
•
Oscillators are active systems that combine resonators with analog mixed-signal ICs that cause the resonators to vibrate - generating, amplifying, and sustaining accurate and stable clock signals. Each oscillator generally delivers a single clock signal.
•
Clock ICs are integrated analog mixed-signal circuits that deliver multiple clock signals by using building blocks such as PLLs, clock dividers, and drivers. Clock ICs require resonators and oscillators for timing references and usually integrate these blocks into complex systems.
In an electronic system, these three product types may be used individually or in combination, depending on the end product’s performance, price, and size requirements. Simpler electronic systems generally require a standalone resonator coupled with a basic oscillator circuit that is embedded in a semiconductor device such as a microprocessor, system on a chip ("SoC"), or application specific integrated circuit ("ASIC"). In this type of system, multiple resonators may be used for different functionality. More complex electronic systems require advanced timing solutions that may use a variety of oscillators, clock ICs, and resonators. The complexity of these timing solutions increases significantly when the performance requirements of the systems that use them increase, such as electronic systems required to support AI datacenters or 5G communication network infrastructure.
Limitations of Legacy Quartz-based Solutions
Quartz crystal has been the predominant technology of choice for resonators for over half a century and will continue to play a role in the timing market. In a quartz-based oscillator, a quartz crystal resonator is paired with a silicon-based clock IC in a ceramic or metal package. However, quartz timing devices, largely unchanged in decades, have many inherent limitations, including limited frequency ranges, sensitivity to rapid temperature changes, vulnerability to vibration

and mechanical shock, susceptibility to frequency jumps at specific temperatures, and limited programmability. Quartz devices must be housed in specialized (i.e., ceramic) packaging, and thus are difficult to integrate into standard semiconductor packages. Quartz products require dedicated manufacturing facilities and have relatively long lead times due to the need to specify various characteristics well in advance of production, without the ability to reconfigure them during the design cycle. In addition, as electronic systems become more complex, feature-rich, and robust, they require more sophisticated timing systems that can seamlessly integrate a variety of oscillators, clock ICs, and resonators in various system-level combinations. This seamless integration is more difficult with legacy quartz systems. These limitations impact the precision and quality of the timing signal in harsh conditions.
Precision MEMS Timing Solutions Poised to Disrupt the Market
In recent years, advances in silicon-based manufacturing and packaging techniques have allowed the development of alternatives to quartz crystal technology. We believe that MEMS is an ideal technology for resonator design. Specifically, its ability to integrate with other circuits in standard semiconductor packages has made scalable standard manufacturing possible for resonators and broader timing technology. MEMS timing products can operate in a wide range of frequencies, are more resistant to vibration, mechanical shock, and temperature changes, and are less susceptible to frequency jumps. MEMS technology is also inherently well-suited to produce timing solutions that are small, and offer high performance, resilience and programmability. Timing solutions based on MEMS technology are manufactured using semiconductor processes in fabs with high capacity, allowing for cost-effective high-volume manufacturing.
The Opportunity for Advanced Solutions
From high-performance network infrastructure equipment to low-power battery-operated devices, Precision Timing solutions enable virtually all electronics, as timing is fundamental in orchestrating the functionality of electronic systems - from providing a reference frequency for processing components (e.g., graphics processing units, microprocessors, microcontrollers, SoCs, ASICs, Field Programmable Gate Arrays) to synchronizing the transfer of data. The complexity of such timing solutions increases significantly with the performance requirements of the systems in which they are used. Below are some examples of end markets in which we believe our silicon-based timing is enabling or has the potential to enable, greater functionality than legacy solutions: 
Communications, Datacenter, and Enterprise
Communications infrastructure equipment used in wireless base stations, wired infrastructure equipment, enterprise networks, cloud data centers, and artificial intelligence infrastructure must provide high performance and stability in demanding environments, which may include temperature fluctuations, and vibration. For example, due to the density and large data processing within the equipment, internal temperatures elevate to levels that need cooling fans that both rapidly change ambient temperatures and cause vibration. If the timing solution within the equipment fails, data may be corrupted or networks can shut down, leading to service disruptions and higher operating costs. 
Automotive, Industrial, and Aerospace
In the past few years, the automotive industry has expanded the use of electronics in vehicles for diverse purposes such as sensing, ADAS, computing, and in-vehicle infotainment. In these applications, timing technology must perform reliably over the life of an automobile in an environment characterized by vibration, mechanical shocks, electromagnetic interference, wide and rapid temperature change. We believe Precision Timing can address many of the challenges associated with this demanding automotive ecosystem.
Industrial equipment, ranging from factory machinery to diagnostic equipment, is often exposed to environments characterized by temperature fluctuation, mechanical shocks, vibration, electromagnetic interference, and power supply noise. We believe our Precision Timing solutions can perform better than legacy quartz-based solutions in demanding industrial environments and with lower power consumption and higher reliability. In addition, with the highly diverse nature of industrial applications and the need for unique operating frequencies, we believe the programmable architecture of our Precision Timing products provides an advantage. 
Timing devices used in aerospace and defense applications such as rockets and satellites need to withstand extreme vibration forces and temperature gradients during operation. Quartz-based solutions can be impacted by vibrational forces acting on the whole system. Precision Timing devices are well-suited for these applications, as they provide up to 50 times better acceleration sensitivity under vibration than comparable quartz-based solutions.

Mobile, IoT and Consumer
The growing reliance on mobile devices has enabled the proliferation of billions of internet-connected devices in industrial and consumer applications. These devices range from smartphones and personal wearable devices to electronics embedded in appliances and industrial machinery. Many of these devices need to package a significant amount of electronics in a limited battery-powered and size-constrained form factor, while still requiring high performance and high accuracy. Due to the ability to integrate with ICs, we believe silicon MEMS timing solutions are well-suited to optimize footprint, reliability, and power consumption of the overall system within mobile, IoT and consumer devices.
Our Solutions and Technology
Our Precision Timing solutions comprise of:
•
Oscillators and Clock ICs
: We have a dedicated analog and mixed-signal engineering team focused on the most complex challenges related to oscillators, such as OCXOs, Super-TCXOs, XOs, VCXOs, and DCXOs, and clock ICs, such as network synchronizers, jitter cleaners, clock generators, and buffers. Our analog mixed-signal technologies include several innovative low-noise circuit-based oscillators, high-performance PLLs, low-noise data converters, and precision low-aging reference circuits. Many of our oscillators use temperature sensing to maximize frequency stability. Our low-power nano-ampere and high-resolution DualMEMS® sensing technologies stabilize our Precision Timing solutions despite rapid temperature changes. We also offer what we consider to be leading solutions across a range of performance attributes, including Allan deviation, power supply noise rejection, temperature-sensing resolution, and integrated phase jitter.
•
MEMS resonators
: We pioneered the silicon MEMS timing industry with the MEMS First®, EpiSeal®, TempFlat® and ApexMEMS processes and technologies. These manufacturing processes and technologies have allowed the hermetically sealed resonator die to be housed in industry-standard, low-cost plastic packages or use advanced packaging techniques such as wafer-level chip-scale packing. These processes and technologies improve resonator stability, increase quality and reliability, and decrease aging effects. Because our MEMS resonators are manufactured in silicon using semiconductor processes, they are easier to integrate into silicon-based oscillators and clock ICs, and allow us to develop tightly-integrated Precision Timing solutions.
•
Advanced system-level integration
: We have extensive know-how in integrating various timing components into elegant system-level solutions. Because the internal elements of our products are silicon - namely the silicon MEMS resonators and the analog mixed-signal ICs - our systems integration design teams are not limited by the restrictions of using dissimilar materials such as quartz crystals and semiconductor die within a package. Our ability to integrate MEMS-based resonators with analog mixed-signal products allows us to develop oscillators and clock ICs in diverse permutations, which helps us innovate without the boundaries imposed by legacy materials.  Our all-silicon approach enables us to solve difficult timing challenges in new ways. For example, we can use advanced packaging designs, yielding some of the smallest footprints in the industry.
We design each key building block of the timing system, from MEMS resonators to oscillator circuits to clock ICs. Our ability to combine our MEMS resonators with analog-mixed signal components in a fabless semiconductor supply chain allows us to build full timing solutions from the ground up, enabling our customers to focus on their core expertise.
Our flexible and programmable Precision Timing solutions offer the following benefits:
•
High performance

As a result, we believe revenue attributable to our largest end customer accounted for approximately 22%, 21%, and 20% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
Sales and Marketing
Our customers’ design cycle from initial engagement to volume shipment typically ranges from six months to three years, with product life cycles of up to ten years or more. For many of our products, early engagement with our customers’ technical staff is critical for success. To ensure an adequate level of early engagement, our sales, marketing, and customer and development engineers work closely with our customers and channel partners to understand, identify, and propose solutions to their systems’ challenges. We work closely with our customers, including technology leaders for the communications markets, to anticipate end customer market needs. In some cases, we work with our end customers to better understand the end customers’ market trends and new requirements that are being placed on our customers.
We sell our products worldwide through multiple channels, including our direct sales force and a network of distributors, contract manufacturers, contracted sales representatives, and independent design houses, as well as SiTimeDirect, our self-service online store.
We have a strategic accounts strategy executed by our direct sales force focused on design engineers, system architects and executive decision makers for the world’s leading electronics companies. These customers lead electronics innovation for their segments - from communications and datacenter equipment, to automotive, and IoT - and design in SiTime Precision Timing solutions that deliver the performance required by these devices. Beyond the well-established strategic account portfolio, we target a broad base of small to mid-size electronics OEMs and ODMs that accelerate growth and market expansion for SiTime. We intend to continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts through increased collaboration with our distributors.

SiTime’s unique programmability combined with the convenience of an online store, with rapid configuration and fulfillment, makes SiTimeDirect a unique approach in the semiconductor industry for Precision Timing solutions.
Seasonality
Our revenue has historically been subject to some seasonal variation. Based on the production schedules of key customers, our products typically see stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year. However, there can be no assurance that this trend will occur in future years.
Manufacturing
We operate a fabless business model and use third-party foundries and assembly and test contractors to manufacture, assemble, and test our semiconductor products. This outsourced manufacturing approach allows us to focus our resources on the design, sale, and marketing of our products. In addition, we believe that outsourcing many of our manufacturing and assembly activities provides us with the flexibility needed to respond to new market opportunities and scale for customer demand, simplifies our operations, and significantly reduces our capital commitments.
We subject our third-party manufacturing contractors to rigorous qualification requirements to meet the high quality and reliability standards required of our products. We carefully qualify each of our partners and their processes before applying the technology to our products. Our engineers work closely with our foundries and other contractors to increase yield, lower manufacturing costs, and improve product quality.
•
Fabrication
. We currently utilize a range of semiconductor process generations to develop and manufacture our products. We use Robert Bosch LLC (“Bosch”) in Germany, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (“TSMC”) in Taiwan, and Teledyne Digital Imaging Inc. ("Teledyne") in Canada as our primary foundries and suppliers for our MEMS timing devices and analog mixed-signal circuit ICs.
•
Package, Assembly and Testing
. Upon the completion of processing at the foundry, we use third-party contractors for packaging, assembly, and testing, including Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc. (“ASE”) in Taiwan, Carsem (M) Sdn Bhd. (“Carsem”) in Malaysia, United Test and Assembly Center Ltd.

(“UTAC”) in Thailand, Hana Semiconductor (Ayutthaya) Co., Ltd in Thailand, Daishinku Corp. (“Daishinku”) in Japan, and STATS ChipPAC Pte Ltd. in Singapore.
•
Warehousing
. Our products are warehoused at our outsourced semiconductor assembly and test facilities located in Malaysia, Taiwan, and Thailand.
We have a supply agreement with Bosch under which Bosch has agreed to fabricate our MEMS wafers based on purchase orders placed by us. Bosch has discretion whether to accept our purchase orders, and we can terminate purchase orders for convenience by giving written notice prior to shipment. The initial term of the supply agreement is for ten years through February 2027 and automatically renews. Other than Bosch, we do not have long-term supply agreements with most of our third-party manufacturing contractors, and we purchase products on a purchase order basis. 
Research and Development
We believe that our future success depends on our ability to introduce enhancements to our existing products and to develop new products for both existing and new markets. As a result, a significant majority of our operating expenses has been allocated towards this effort. Our research and development efforts are focused primarily on MEMS and advanced clock IC design and advanced system-level integration for Precision Timing solutions.
We have assembled a core team of experienced engineers and systems designers who conduct research and development activities in the United States, the Netherlands, Malaysia, Finland, Japan, Taiwan, Ukraine, and India. As of December 31, 2024, we had 182 full-time equivalent employees supporting research and development efforts worldwide. 
Intellectual Property
We rely primarily on patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, and other contractual protections, to protect our technologies and proprietary know-how. As of December 31, 2024, we had 134 issued U.S. patents, expiring generally between 2026 and 2040, and 51 pending U.S. patent applications (including 11 provisional applications). We also had five foreign issued patents expiring in 2036 and five pending foreign patent applications. Our issued patents and pending patent applications generally relate to our MEMS fabrication process, MEMS resonators, circuits, packaging, and oscillator systems.
In addition to our own intellectual property, we also use third-party licenses for certain technologies, including some that are embedded in our MEMS solutions. For example, we have a license to certain patents from Bosch relating to the design and manufacture of MEMS-based timing applications and a license to certain intellectual property of Aura relating to our clock products. The patent rights obtained under the license agreement with Bosch expire between 2025 and 2029, and the license agreement expires upon expiration of the last patent licensed under the agreement. We do not believe there will be any significant impact upon expiration of these patents.
We generally control access to and use of our confidential information and trade secrets through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, and customers. We rely in part on the laws of the United States and international laws to protect our work. All employees and consultants are required to execute confidentiality agreements in connection with their employment and consulting relationships with us. We also require them to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived or made in connection with the employment or consulting relationship. However, we cannot guarantee that we have entered into such agreements with every such party and we may not have adequate remedies in case of a breach of any such agreements. Our trade secrets could be disclosed to our competitors or others may independently develop substantially equivalent technologies or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets. Trade secrets can be difficult to protect and some courts inside and outside of the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may still copy, misappropriate, or otherwise obtain and use our software, technology, or other information that we regard as our proprietary intellectual property. In addition, we intend to expand our international operations, and effective patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret, and other intellectual property protection may not be available or may be limited in some foreign countries.
The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights and positions, which has resulted in protracted and expensive litigation for many companies. We have in the past received, and we may in the future receive, communications alleging liability for damages or challenging the validity of our intellectual property or proprietary rights. Any litigation, regardless of success or merit, could cause us to incur substantial expenses, reduce our sales, and divert the efforts of our management and other personnel. In the event we receive an adverse result in 
14
Table of Contents
any litigation, we could be required to pay substantial damages, seek licenses from third parties, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, cease sale of products, expend significant resources to develop alternative technology, or discontinue the use of processes requiring the relevant technology.
Competition
The global semiconductor market in general, and the timing market in particular, is highly competitive. We expect competition to increase and intensify as additional companies enter our markets and as internal resources of large original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) grow. Increased competition could result in price pressure, reduced gross margins, and loss of market share, any of which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Our competitors range from large, international companies offering a wide range of timing products to smaller companies specializing in narrow market verticals. Companies that we primarily compete with include, but are not limited to, Abracon, LLC, Daishinku Corp., Diodes Incorporated, Kyocera Corporation, Microchip Technology Inc., Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd, Nihon Dempa Kogoyo., Ltd., Rakon Limited, Renesas Electronics Corporation, Seiko Epson Corporation, Skyworks Solutions, Inc., Texas Instruments Incorporated, and TXC Corporation.
Our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control, including industry and general economic trends. Many of our competitors are substantially larger, have greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, customer support, and other resources, are more established than we are, and have significantly better brand recognition and broader product offerings. This may enable them to better withstand downturns in the timing market in which we compete, as well as adverse economic or market conditions. During past periods of downturns in our industry, competition in the markets in which we operate intensified as our customers reduced their purchase orders. We maintain our competitive position through our ability to successfully design, develop, and market new and existing Precision Timing solutions in a timely manner and to retain existing customers and add new customers.
Government Regulation
Our business activities are worldwide and subject to various federal, state, local and foreign regulations and our products are governed by a number of rules and regulations. To date, our compliance with these regulations has not had a material impact on our results of operations.
Human Capital Resources and Empowerment
We believe that our company culture, which promotes innovation, open communication, and teamwork, has been critical to our success. Our success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key employees and on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees, particularly highly-skilled engineers involved in the design, development, support, and manufacture of new and existing products and processes, as well as our sales and marketing team, which is critical to achieving design wins, creating our brand awareness and reputation, and building long-lasting relationships with our customers and other industry participants. In order for us to attract the best talent, we aim to offer challenging work in an environment that enables our employees to learn, grow, and reach their full potential.
Our human capital resource objectives include identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and future employees. We strive to attract and retain the most talented employees in the industry and across the globe by offering competitive compensation and benefits that support their health, financial, and emotional well-being. Our compensation philosophy is based on rewarding each employee’s individual contributions. We use a combination of fixed and variable pay including base salary, bonuses, performance awards, and stock-based compensation. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain, and motivate selected employees through the granting of stock-based compensation awards. We offer employees benefits that vary by country and are designed to meet or exceed local laws and to be competitive in the marketplace. Examples of benefits offered in the U.S. include: a 401(k) plan with employer contributions; health benefits; life, business travel, and disability insurance; additional voluntary insurance; paid time off and parental leave; and paid counseling assistance. For further information concerning our equity incentive plans, see Note 8, Stock-based Compensation, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We are committed to the health, safety, and wellness of our employees. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of health and wellness programs, including benefits that support their physical and mental

We regularly review succession plans and focus on promoting internal talent to help grow our employees' careers.
