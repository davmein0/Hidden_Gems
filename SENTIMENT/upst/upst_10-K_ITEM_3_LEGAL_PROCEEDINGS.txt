PART II
ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES
Market Information for Common Stock
Our common stock has been traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “UPST” since December 16, 2020. Prior to that date, there was no public trading market for our common stock.
Holders of Record
As of February 6, 2025, we had 159 holders of record of our common stock. Because many of our shares of common stock are held in street name by brokers and other nominees on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of beneficial owners of our common stock represented by these holders of record.
Dividend Policy
We have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to declare cash dividends will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors, subject to applicable laws, and will depend on a number of factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, general business conditions, and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant.
Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 
None.
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
There were no repurchases of the Company’s common stock during the three months ended December 31, 2024.
Stock Performance Graph
The following graph compares the cumulative total return to stockholders on our common stock relative to the cumulative total returns of the Nasdaq Global Select Index and the S&P Information Technology Index. An investment of $100 (with reinvestment of all dividends) is assumed to have been made in our common stock and in each index on December 16, 2020, the date our common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, and its relative performance is tracked through December 31, 2024.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those identified below and those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future. 
 Overview
Upstart applies artificial intelligence (“AI”) models and cloud applications to the process of underwriting consumer credit. Our AI marketplace connects consumers with our lending partners. Consumers can access Upstart-powered loans via Upstart.com, through a lender-branded product on our lending partners’ own websites, and through auto dealerships that use our Upstart Auto Retail software. We enable our lending partners to provide an exceptional digital-first experience to consumers and originate valuable credit products. As our technology continues to improve and additional lending partners adopt our platform, consumers benefit from improved access to affordable and frictionless credit. 
We believe that banks and other traditional lenders will continue to be at the forefront of consumer lending in the United States. We believe AI lending will become increasingly critical as this industry continues to undergo a broad digital transformation. Our strategy is to partner with banks and credit unions and provide them with access to an AI lending marketplace that they can configure as they originate consumer loans, according to their own business and regulatory requirements. 
Loans issued through our marketplace are retained by our lending partners, purchased by our network of institutional investors, or funded by Upstart’s balance sheet. Investors may also invest in Upstart-powered loans through our pass-through and securitization programs. We believe that institutional investors, often referred to as “private credit,” have played an increasingly large role in financing consumer lending in the United States and we have adapted our strategy to take advantage of this opportunity.
Out of the total principal of loans transacted on our marketplace during the year ended December 31, 2024, 65% were purchased by institutional investors, 25% were retained by our lending partners, and 10% were held on our balance sheet. We retain loans on our balance sheet to fill gaps in investor demand, to aid in price discovery, and for research and development purposes (“R&D Loans”), including to test and evaluate our AI models for these loans. R&D Loans are primarily our auto refinance and auto retail loan products, personal loan products issued to new categories of borrowers, and other new loan products, including small dollar loans and HELOCs. R&D Loans are not yet part of our fully-established capital markets programs with institutional investors and we continue our work on developing such programs. The remainder of loans on our balance sheet represent core personal loans, which Upstart would sell to institutional investors.
To improve the loan funding capacity for our marketplace across business and macroeconomic cycles, we have secured multiple committed capital and other co-investment arrangements with institutional investors and lending partners beginning in 2023, which have delivered a significant amount of loan funding to the Upstart marketplace. While these efforts have strengthened the amount and resiliency of our loan funding, we continue to secure additional capital to support the growth of our business and further diversify our sources of capital and institutional investor base to ensure long-term scalability.

Our Economic Model
Upstart’s revenues are primarily earned in exchange for the use of our platform and for borrower referral services provided to our lending partners through our lending marketplace. Fees for these services can be either fixed or based on a variable price per unit, depending on the contractual arrangement. Platform services result in loan originations by our lending partners using our platform and referral services result in a referral of a borrower obtaining a loan from our lending partners. These fees are combined for accounting purposes as they represent a single performance obligation. We do not charge borrowers on our platform any referral, platform, or other similar fees for loans originated by our lending partners.
We also charge the holder of the loan (either a lending partner or institutional investor) a servicing fee based on the outstanding principal over the lifetime of the loan for ongoing servicing of the loan. In addition, we receive certain ancillary borrower fees inclusive of late payment fees and ACH fail fees as part of loan servicing. Further, we earn a portion of our revenue from interest income for loans held on our balance sheet. 

Loans on our platform today are predominantly sourced from Upstart.com. For these loans, we incur variable costs in the form of borrower acquisition costs and borrower verification and servicing costs. Borrower acquisition, verification and servicing costs are highly correlated with Transaction Volume (as defined below), which fluctuates on a quarter by quarter basis. We continue to focus on improvements to our level of automation and Conversion Rate (as defined below) through our increasingly sophisticated risk models and our evolving channel mix which have contributed to improving our loan unit economics over time. 
Credit Performance
We consider credit performance of Upstart-powered loans to be one of the most important measures of the effectiveness of our AI models. However, credit performance is impacted by multiple factors, including factors that our models do not predict, such as macroeconomic conditions. 
We evaluate the credit performance of core personal loans by comparing the target returns expected at the time of origination to the returns received by our lending partners and institutional investors. The target return, a critical component of our loan pricing, is calculated using estimated cash flows, which are developed based on a number of factors, including credit losses and prepayment rates. While target returns across our lending partners and institutional investors vary depending on their programs’ objectives and risk tolerance, overall performance is calculated based on the variance between the initially expected returns and the actual return on capital invested in Upstart-powered loans.
Lending is a cyclical industry, and we believe it is important to take a long-term view of credit performance. An equal investment in all vintages of Upstart-powered core personal loans that originated in the first quarter of 2018 through the third quarter of 2024 is currently expected to deliver returns in line with a blended target of 9.6%. 
At a more granular level, all quarterly vintages of core personal loans that originated in 2018 through the fourth quarter of 2020 are currently forecasted to meet or exceed the target returns set at the time of loan origination.
However, the quarterly vintages of core personal loans that originated in the first quarter of 2021 through the first quarter of 2024 are currently forecasted to underperform relative to their target returns. Even though our underwriting models have over time utilized more variables and data points about borrowers which has improved model performance, they were not designed to predict the severe impact of recent changes to macroeconomic conditions, credit market volatility and interest rate fluctuations that have occurred, all of which were (and still are) beyond our control. The forecasted underperformance for these vintages reflects the impact of a combination of factors that occurred during that period, including the elimination of government stimulus measures and the worsening of the macroeconomic environment, via rising inflation and the resulting sharply higher interest rates.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted)
The evolving macroeconomic conditions during that period led to more borrowers not making payments on their personal loans than anticipated at the time of underwriting. For example, borrowers likely prioritized repayment of loans that are secured by necessities, such as mortgages or auto loans, over unsecured personal loans. Higher interest rates also likely led to higher payment obligations, which reduced the ability of borrowers to remain current on their obligations. These factors led to increased delinquencies, defaults and bankruptcies declared by borrowers, resulting in more charge-offs and fewer recoveries, all of which had an adverse effect on the credit performance of loans facilitated on our marketplace during that time period.
To respond to macroeconomic changes more rapidly, we introduced the Upstart Macro Index (“UMI”) in 2023, which estimates the impact that observed macroeconomic changes may have on credit performance for Upstart-powered unsecured personal loans.
The core personal loans that originated in the second quarter of 2024 or later are currently forecasted to deliver returns in line with target yields. This reversion in performance, relative to the quarterly vintages of core personal loans that originated in the first quarter 2021 through the first quarter 2024, was driven by a combination of factors including increased conservatism in underwriting and the relative stabilization of macroeconomic conditions, as reflected in the UMI, which has helped credit perform in line with our models’ predictions as there has been less unexpected volatility in macroeconomic factors impacting loan performance. Our most recent AI models also benefited from more data on borrower repayment patterns from the period of significant macroeconomic changes. This resulted in substantive positive changes in observed and expected borrower repayments even for vintages with limited seasoning. This makes our more recent models more accurate than those used in early 2021. Refer to section “
Factors Affecting Our Performance - Impact of Macroeconomic Environmen
t” for additional details.
For the core personal loans held on our balance sheet, target returns are set similar to those of our institutional investors. We purchase core personal loans to address fluctuations of supply and demand in our marketplace and periodically sell these loans to institutional investors prior to their maturity. Demonstrated credit performance significantly influences sale prices in these transactions and impacts our overall financial results. 
We measure credit performance of R&D Loans, which are a substantial part of the loan portfolio held on our balance sheet (refer to section “
Liquidity and Capital Resources - Composition of Retained Loan Portfolio
”), using an approach similar to the core personal loans held on our balance sheet. Variances between targeted and actual returns for these loans are expected to be higher, as the underlying risk models are in the earlier phases of their development cycle in comparison to core personal loans. The initial target returns for these products are also generally lower than comparative market benchmarks. The combination of these factors decreases the value of R&D Loans on our balance sheet, which negatively impacts our overall financial results. However, this is a required part of our product development cycle, and should be considered alongside other product development costs, such as data science and engineering. These costs collectively are managed as part of overall investment in product development. As our R&D models improve, we expect the difference between target and delivered returns will decrease and converge to market returns. This will allow us to launch these products for our lending partners and institutional investors, at which point they become part of our core product offerings.
Factors Affecting Our Performance 
Continued Improvements to Our AI Models
Much of our historical growth has been driven by improvements to our AI models. These models benefit over time from a flywheel effect that is characteristic of machine learning systems: accumulation of repayment data leads to improved accuracy of risk and fraud predictions, which generally results in higher approval rates and lower interest rates, leading to increased volume, and consequently greater accumulation of repayment data. This virtuous cycle describes an important mechanism by which our business grows simply through model learning and recalibration. We expect to continue to invest significantly in the development of our AI models and platform functionalities.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted)
Beyond the ongoing accumulation of repayment data used to train our models, we also frequently make discrete improvements to model accuracy by upgrading algorithms and incorporating new variables, both of which have historically resulted in higher approval rates, more competitive loan offers, increased automation, and faster growth. As a second order effect, the impact of these improvements on our conversion funnel also allows us to unlock new marketing channels over time that have previously been unprofitable. 
We believe that ongoing improvements to our technology in this manner will allow us to further expand access and lower rates for creditworthy borrowers, which will continue to fuel our growth. Should the pace of these improvements slow down or cease, or should we discover forms of model upgrades which improve accuracy at the expense of volume, our growth rates could be adversely affected. 
Impact of Macroeconomic Environment
In an economic downturn, we believe consumer lending will generally contract. Lending partners and institutional investors will generally require higher rates of return, which in turn increases the interest rates offered to borrowers, leading to lower borrower demand. Macroeconomic factors can also cause fluctuations of available capital in our lending marketplace due to shifts in the risk preferences of our lending partners and institutional investors. We expect these dynamics would generally invert in an economic upswing.
For example, loan funding provided by institutional investors started to become constrained in 2022, largely due to concerns about the macroeconomic environment. In response to inflationary pressure, the U.S. Federal Reserve  raised interest rates through 2023, leading to more expensive loan offers across borrower categories, which impacted our business. At the same time, macroeconomic uncertainty  generally made institutional investors more cautious and caused them to reduce the amount of capital available to fund Upstart-powered loans. 
In response to this challenging macroeconomic environment where many lenders and credit investors had significantly reduced or paused investments in Upstart-powered loans, we announced reductions in workforce in January 2023 (“January 2023 Plan”) that resulted in the termination of approximately 20% of our workforce. To further decrease operating costs, streamline operations, and return Upstart to profitability in the future, du
ring the 
year ended December 31, 2024, the Company implemented an additional series of initiatives which reduced the Company’s workforce by approximately 13%. Refer to “
Note 16.  Reorganization Expenses
” for more information. While we believe that the macroeconomic environment started to improve in 2024,  disruption in financial markets could impair our lending partners and result in constrained funding, which would adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.
In order to create greater stability for our business, beginning in 2023, we secured several committed capital and co-investment arrangements with institutional investors and other third-parties that provide loan funding over longer durations. We continue our work on expanding our loan funding capacity and in the interim period, we have utilized and may continue to utilize our balance sheet to support loan funding. While our goal remains to operate as a capital-light marketplace for credit, we will continue to leverage our balance sheet in the short term as we evaluate opportunities to implement committed capital and co-investment structures. 
Our credit decisioning process takes into account macroeconomic conditions data, such as unemployment levels and personal savings rates, that we receive from third-party sources. To respond to macroeconomic changes and provide relevant and up-to-date information to our lending partners, we introduced a new metric, UMI, in 2023. UMI is designed to quantify the level of underlying macroeconomic risk, specific to our borrower base, relative to a benign credit environment. A UMI of 1.0 reflects loan losses at this baseline rate. We subsequently launched an update to UMI which removes seasonal patterns to better describe the underlying macroeconomic effects. As of December 31, 2024, UMI was measured at approximately 1.40, meaning that current macroeconomic conditions contributed an incremental risk of approximately 40% to the repayment performance of an Upstart-powered unsecured personal loan, compared to the baseline.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted)
UMI impacts interest rates for loans offered on our marketplace and, as a result, affects the pool of qualified potential borrowers and consumer demand for the loans. The elevated level of UMI resulted in higher interest rates for the loans offered on our marketplace and in turn, decreased the size of the pool of qualified potential borrowers and the borrower acceptance rates of such loans. With our investment in UMI, we focus on our ability to better separate risk among borrowers in our credit decisioning process in changing macroeconomic conditions.
We continuously monitor the direct and indirect impacts of the current macroeconomic conditions, including interest rate changes, on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
Lending Partners and Market Adoption
Lending partners play two key roles in Upstart’s ecosystem: funding loans and acquiring new customers. Traditional lenders, such as banks, tend to enjoy efficient sources of funding due to their expansive base of deposits. As they adopt our technology and fund a growing proportion of our marketplace transactions, offers made to borrowers will typically improve, generally leading to higher conversion rates and faster growth for our platform. 
New lending partners also represent additional acquisition channels through which we can reach and source prospective new borrowers, as these lending partners develop and implement their own digital and in-branch campaigns to drive traffic from their existing customer base to our platform. We view this emerging growth channel to be additive to the marketing acquisition programs we currently run at Upstart. 
To provide funding support beyond our lending partners, we have built, and continue to expand, a broad network of institutional investors that can fund Upstart-powered loans through secondary loan purchasing and issuance of pass-through certificates and asset-backed securitizations. This diverse network of capital helps to minimize our reliance on any one funding source. However, any trend towards reduced participation by lending partners will generally erode the overall competitiveness of the offers on our platform, and any declining trend in the participation of broader institutional investment markets with respect to funding availability for Upstart-powered loans will adversely affect our business. 
We believe that disruptions in the banking sector may limit our ability to attract new lending partners and may cause existing lending partners to reduce loan originations on our platform. In order to address recent funding constraints for our personal loans, Upstart has utilized its balance sheet to support short-term funding requirements of loans that would otherwise be purchased and held by institutional investors or securitized. We have secured several committed capital and co-investment arrangements with institutional investors and lending partners, which have delivered, and are expected to deliver, a significant amount of loan funding to the Upstart marketplace. 
We believe that continued focus on improving our AI models and demonstrating strong performance of Upstart-powered loans over time will allow us to further diversify our sources of capital for our lending marketplace and mitigate the volatility in our loan funding supply.
Product Expansion and Innovation
We believe that significant growth opportunities exist to apply our evolving AI technology to additional segments of credit, and we continue to invest in research and development of our products. We introduced a new offering of unsecured personal loans for borrowers interested in small dollar loans in 2022, launched our HELOC product in the third quarter of 2023, and launched auto secured personal loans in the second quarter of 2024. We may incur expenses to support the launch of new products and fund early loan originations. Monetization prospects for new products are uncertain, and costs associated with integrating, developing and marketing new products might not be recovered, which could weigh on our top-line growth and profitability. For full-year 2024, new products had not yet achieved positive unit economics.

Transaction Volume
We define Transaction Volume, Dollars as the total principal of loan originations (or committed amounts for HELOCs) facilitated on our marketplace during the years presented. We define Transaction Volume, Number of Loans as the number of loan originations (or commitments issued for HELOCs) facilitated on our marketplace during the years presented. Increases in Transaction Volume are dependent on our loan funding programs having sufficient access to capital. Decreases in the availability of funding due to factors such as volatility in the capital markets and macroeconomic conditions will generally cause a decline in Transaction Volume. Transaction Volume is driven by improvements in our AI models and technology, including our ability to streamline and automate the loan application and origination process. Transaction Volume can also be driven by several other factors, including borrower acceptance rates and their sensitivity to the interest rates offered through our platform. We believe these metrics are good proxies for our overall scale and reach as a marketplace. Transaction Volume, Dollars increased 28% in the 
year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year and Transaction Volume, Number of Loans 
increased 59% in the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year. These increases were primarily due to model improvements and product initiatives, which resulted in an increase in the number of qualified borrowers and more attractive loan offers. The increase in Transaction Volume, Number of Loans was higher than the increase in Transaction Volume, Dollars due to the decrease in average loan size, primarily due to the increase in small dollar loans. 
Conversion Rate 
We define Conversion Rate as the Transaction Volume, Number of Loans in a period divided by the number of rate inquiries received that we estimate to be legitimate, which we record when a borrower requests a loan offer on our platform. We track this metric to understand the impact of improvements to the efficiency of our borrower funnel on our overall growth. Historically, our Conversion Rate has benefited from improvements to our

(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted)
technology, which have made our evaluation of risk more accurate and our verification process more automated, or from the addition of lending partners that have made our offers more competitive. However, our Conversion Rate can be impacted by a variety of internal factors such as changes in the amount of origination fees that we charge or changes in the rate of returns we target for our lending partners and institutional investors. External factors such as shifts in macroeconomic conditions, including interest rate changes, also impact our Conversion Rate. Our ability to continue to improve our Conversion Rate depends in part on our ability to continue to improve our AI models and Percentage of Loans Fully Automated and the mix of marketing channels in any given peri
od. Our Conversion Rate 
increased to 16.5% in the year ended December 31, 2024 fr
om 9.7% in t
he year ended December 31, 2023, primarily driven by underwriting model improvements and product initiatives, coupled with continued optimization in our acquisition channels.
Percentage of Loans Fully Automated 
A driver of our Contribution Margin and operating efficiency is the Percentage of Loans Fully Automated, which is defined as the total number of loans in a given period originated end-to-end (from initial rate request to final funding for personal loans and small dollar loans and from initial rate request to signing of the loan agreement for auto loans) with no human involvement required by the Company divided by the Transaction Volume, Number of Loans in the same period. We have been successful in increasing the level of loan automation on the platform over the past few years while simultaneously holding fraud rates at very low levels. We believe our growth over the last several years has been driven in part by our ability to rapidly streamline and automate the loan application and o
rigination process on our platform. We expect growth of the Percentage of Loans Fully Automated to subside in the near term. However, as we expand our loan offerings, this percentage may fluctuate from period to period depending on the loan offering mix and other external factors. Our Percentage of Loans Fully Automated 
increased to 91% in the year ended December 31, 2024 from 
87% in the 
year ended December 31, 2023

Contribution Profit and Contribution Margin
 To derive Contribution Profit, we subtract from revenue from fees, net our borrower acquisition costs as well as our borrower verification and servicing costs. To calculate Contribution Margin we divide Contribution Profit by revenue from fees, net.

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin
We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense and certain payroll tax expenses, depreciation and amortization, expense on convertible notes, provision for income taxes, gain on debt extinguishment, net gain on lease modification and reorganization expenses. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin includes interest expense from corporate debt and warehouse credit facilities which is incurred in the course of earning corresponding interest income.

Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Per Share
We define Adjusted Net Income (Loss) as net income (loss) exclusive of stock-based compensation expense and certain payroll tax expenses as well as certain items that are not related to core business and ongoing operations, such as gain on debt extinguishment, net gain on lease modification and reorganization expenses. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Per Share is calculated by dividing Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Per Share by the weighted-average common shares outstanding. See the section titled “

Components of Results of Operations 
Revenue from Fees, Net 
Platform and Referral Fees, Net 
We charge our lending partners platform fees in exchange for usage of our AI lending marketplace, which includes collection of loan application data, underwriting of credit risk, verification and fraud detection, and the delivery of electronic loan offers and associated documentation. We also charge referral fees to our lending partners in exchange for the referral of borrowers from Upstart.com. Referral fees are charged to lending partners on a per borrower basis upon origination of a loan. These fees are charged net of any fees the lending partner charges Upstart. Upstart pays these lending partners a one-time loan premium fee upon completion of the minimum holding periods. Upstart also pays certain lending partners monthly loan trailing fees based on the amount and timing of principal and interest payments made by borrowers of the underlying loans. 
The Company also recognizes fees in relation to contracts with auto dealers for the use of Upstart Auto Retail software, a cloud-based solution that facilitates dealership operations and enables them to provide consumers with access to Upstart-powered auto loans. Refer to “
Note 2.  Revenue
” to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. 
Servicing and Other Fees, Net 
Servicing fees are calculated as a percentage of outstanding principal and are charged monthly to any entities holding loans facilitated through our marketplace, to compensate us for activities we perform throughout the loan term, including collection, processing and reconciliations of payments received, institutional investor reporting and borrower customer support. Servicing fees are recorded net of any gains, losses or changes to fair value recognized in the underlying servicing rights and obligations, which are carried as assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Upstart currently acts as loan servicer for substantially all outstanding loans facilitated through the Upstart marketplace. Borrower payment collections for loans that are more than 30 days past due or charged off are generally outsourced to third-party collection agencies. Upstart charges lending partners and

institutional investors for collection agency fees related to their outstanding loan portfolio. Upstart also receives certain ancillary fees on a per transaction basis inclusive of late payment fees and ACH fail fees. 
Interest Income, Interest Expense, and Fair Value Adjustments, Net 
Interest income, interest expense, and fair value adjustments, net is comprised of interest income, interest expense and net changes in the fair value of financial instruments held on our consolidated balance sheets as part of our ongoing operating activities, excluding loan servicing assets and liabilities. Interest income, interest expense, and fair value adjustments, net also includes realized gain or loss on the sale of loans. Interest income, interest expense, and fair value adjustments, net can fluctuate based on the fair value of financial instruments held on our consolidated balance sheets. This amount has historically been a small percentage of our total revenue, and we do not manage our business with a focus on growing this component of revenue. 
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of costs incurred across various advertising channels, including expenses for partnerships with third parties providing borrower referrals, direct mail and digital advertising campaigns, as well as other expenses associated with building overall brand awareness and experiential marketing costs. Sales and marketing expenses also include payroll and other personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense. These costs are recognized in the period incurred. We expect that our sales and marketing expenses will generally fluctuate as a percentage of our total revenue from period to period and may increase as we hire additional sales and marketing personnel, increase our marketing activities and build greater brand awareness. 
Customer Operations 
Customer operations expenses include payroll and other personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation expense, for personnel engaged in borrower onboarding, loan servicing, customer support and other operational teams. These costs also include systems, third-party services and tools we use as part of loan servicing, information verification, fraud detection and payment processing activities. These costs are recognized in the period incurred. We expect that our customer operations expenses will generally fluctuate as a percentage of our total revenue from period to period, and may increase in absolute dollars as we expand our portfolio. 
Engineering and Product Development 
Engineering and product development expenses primarily consist of payroll and other personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation expense, for the engineering and product development teams as well as the costs of systems and tools used by these teams. These costs are recognized in the period incurred. We expect that our engineering and product development expenses will generally fluctuate as a percentage of our total revenue from period to period, and may increase in absolute dollars as we expand our engineering and product development team to continue to improve our AI models and develop new products and product enhancements. 
General, Administrative and Other 
General, administrative and other expenses consist primarily of payroll and other personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation expense, for legal and compliance, finance and accounting, human resources and facilities teams, as well as depreciation and amortization of property, equipment, software, and intangibles, professional services fees, facilities and travel expenses. These costs are recognized in the period incurred. We expect to increase the size of our general and administrative function to support the further growth of our business. As a result, we expect that our general, administrative and other expenses will increase in absolute dollars but may fluctuate as a percentage of our total revenue from period to period.

Revenue from fees, net increased $75.0 million, or 13%, in the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the prior year, due to an $88.3 million increase in revenue from platform and referral fees, net and a $13.3 million decrease in servicing and other fees, net. The increase of the platform and referral fees, net was primarily driven by a 59% increase in the Transaction Volume, Number of Loans from 437,659 in the year ended December 31, 2023 to 697,092 in the year ended December 31, 2024. The decrease in servicing fees was primarily due to a decrease in the outstanding principal of serviced loans, partially offset by an increase in net gain related to loan servicing rights upon loan sales.

Consists of balances recognized by entities participating in ongoing operating activities of the Company, excluding entities associated with the UPST 2023-2 consolidated securitization.
Interest income, interest expense, and fair value adjustments, net increased $47.9 million, or 102%, in the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the prior year. The increase was driven by a $36.1 million decrease in unfavorable fair value adjustments, net, and a $17.4 million increase in interest income, partially offset by a $5.5 million increase in interest expense. The decrease in unfavorable fair value adjustments is primarily attributable to a $19.3 million decrease in negative mark-to-market adjustments and loan charge-offs, an $8.8 million decrease in fair value loss on beneficial interests, and an $8.1 million decrease in realized losses on loan sales. The increase in interest income was primarily driven by an increase in the average outstanding principal balance of loans held on the consolidated balance sheets during the period, including $9.3 million of interest income recognized by consolidated securitization entities. The increase was partially offset by an increase in interest expense due to an increase in borrowings, including an increase of $2.9 million recognized by consolidated securitization entities. The increase in interest income and interest expense recognized by consolidated securitization entities was due to the timing of the transaction, resulting in full year of income and expense recognized in 2024 compared to two quarters in 2023.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
To supplement our consolidated financial statements prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the non-GAAP financial measures of Contribution Profit, Contribution Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Per Share to provide investors with additional information about our financial performance and to enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects. We are presenting these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe they provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our core financial performance over multiple years with the performance of other companies. 
However, non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in their usefulness to investors because they have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, our consolidated financial statements prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.

To address these limitations, we provide a reconciliation of Contribution Profit, Contribution Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Per Share to income (loss) from operations and net income (loss), respectively. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure and to view Contribution Profit, Contribution Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Per Share in conjunction with their respective related GAAP financial measures.
Contribution Profit and Contribution Margin
We use Contribution Profit and Contribution Margin as part of our overall assessment of performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our Board of Directors concerning our financial performance. We believe Contribution Profit and Contribution Margin are useful to investors for year-to-year comparisons of our business and in evaluating and understanding our operating results and ability to scale. Contribution Profit and Contribution Margin are also useful to investors because our management uses Contribution Profit and Contribution Margin, in conjunction with financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, to evaluate our operating results and financial performance and the effectiveness of our strategies. 
Contribution Profit and Contribution Margin have limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Contribution Profit and Contribution Margin are not GAAP financial measures of, nor do they imply profitability. Even if our revenue exceeds variable expenses over time, we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability, and the relationship of revenue to variable expenses is not necessarily indicative of future performance. Contribution Profit and Contribution Margin do not reflect all of our variable expenses and involve some judgment and discretion around what costs vary directly with loan volume. Other companies that present contribution profit and contribution margin may calculate it differently and, therefore, similarly titled measures presented by other companies may not be directly comparable to ours. 
The following table presents a reconciliation of loss from operations to Contribution Profit and Contribution Margin. We define Operating Margin as our loss from operations divided by revenue from fees, net.

Borrower acquisition costs consist of our sales and marketing expenses adjusted to exclude costs not directly attributable to attracting a new borrower, such as payroll-related expenses for our business development and marketing teams, as well as other operational, brand awareness and marketing activities. These costs do not include reorganization expenses.

Borrower verification and servicing costs were $157.8 million, $116.6 million, and $128.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively. Borrower verification and servicing costs consist of payroll and other personnel-related expenses for personnel engaged in loan onboarding, verification and servicing, as well as servicing system costs. It excludes payroll and personnel-related expenses and stock-based compensation for certain members of our customer operations team whose work is not directly attributable to onboarding and servicing loans. These costs do not include reorganization expenses.
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin 
We believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are useful for investors to use in comparing our financial performance with the performance of other companies for the following reasons: 
•
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation, and interest expense, that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon their financing and capital structures, and the method by which assets were acquired; and 
•
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin eliminate the impact of certain items such as stock-based compensation expense and certain payroll tax expense, expense on convertible n
otes, gain on debt extinguishment, net gain on lease modification and reorganization expenses that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of our business; and
•
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin provide consistency and comparability with o
ur past financial performance, and facilitate comparisons with other companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results. 
Our use of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin has limitations as an analytical tool, and these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are as follows: 
•
Although depreciation expense is a non-cash charge, the assets being depreciated may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; 
•
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin exclude stock-based compensation expense and certain employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions. Stock-based compensation expense has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense for our business and an important part of our compensation strategy. The amount of employer payroll tax-related expense on employee stock transactions is dependent on our stock price and other factors that are beyond our control and do not correlate to the operation of the business; 
•
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not reflect: (1) changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (2) interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt, which reduces cash available to us; or (3) tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and 
•
The expenses and other items that we exclude in our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin may differ from the expenses and other items, if any, that other companies may exclude from adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin when they report their operating results. 
Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin should be considered along with other operating and financial performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a reconciliation of net loss and Net Loss Margin to Adjusted EBITDA Margin. We define Net Loss Margin as net loss divided by total revenue.

Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Per Share
We define Adjusted Net Income (Loss) as net income (loss) exclusive of stock-based compensation expense and certain payroll tax expense, 
gain on debt extinguishment, net gain on lease modification, and 
reorganization expenses. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Per Share is calculated by dividing Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Per Share by the weighted-average common shares outstanding. We believe Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Per Share are useful measures for investors in evaluating our ability to generate earnings, more readily compare between past and future periods, and provide comparability of our performance with the performance of other companies.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
Sources and Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents
As of December 31, 2024, our primary source of liquidity was unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $788.4 million. We also held $5.0 million of investments in certificates of deposit with maturities greater than three months as of December 31, 2024. Changes in the balance of cash and cash equivalents are generally a result of working capital fluctuations and the timing of purchases and sales of loans facilitated through our marketplace. To finance purchases of certain loans facilitated through our lending marketplace, we rely on our warehouse credit facilities through the special-purpose trusts and corporate cash. 
Our convertible senior notes have an aggregate principal balance of $1,230.4 million and bear interest at a rate of 0.25% per year in the case of the 2026 Notes, 2.00% per year in the case of the 2029 Notes, and 1.00% per year in the case of the 2030 Notes, in each case payable semiannually. The 2026 Notes mature on 
August 15, 2026, the 2029 Notes mature on October 1, 2029, and the 2030 Notes mature on November 15, 2030, in each case

earlier converted, redeemed, or repurchased in accordance with their terms. Refer to “
Note 8.  Borrowings
” in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details on our Notes.
Our warehouse credit facilities, which mature between December 2025 and June 2028, allow us to borrow up to an aggregate of $475.0 million to purchase unsecured personal loans, $100.0 million to purchase small dollar loans, and up to $50.0 million to purchase auto loans. As of June 14, 2024, the revolving period ended for Upstart Auto Warehouse Trust, and we may no longer draw from the facility. The Upstart Auto Warehouse Trust facility matures in December 2025, by which time all outstanding amounts owed must be repaid. As of December 31, 2024, we have drawn an aggregate of $195.6 million on our warehouse credit facilities. Refer to “
Note 8.  Borrowings
” in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details on our warehouse credit facilities.
We lease office facilities under operating lease agreements which expire between 2027 and 2029. Our cash requirements related to these lease agreements are $55.9 million, of which $15.4 million is expected to be paid within the next 12 months. Refer to “
Note 11.  Leases
” in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details on our operating lease obligations.
We have committed to purchase loans from certain lending partners at the conclusion of the required holding period, which is generally equal to three business days. As of December 31, 2024, the total loan purchase commitment was $72.8 million. We have also extended a line of credit to a third-party in connection with one of our committed capital and other co-investment arrangements. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had unfunded commitments related to the line of credit of $7.6 million. The Company also has commitments to fund future advances on HELOCs. As of December 31, 2024, these commitments were $7.6 million, however since these commitments could expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. See “
Note 12.  Commitments and Contingencies
” in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details on our commitments.
In connection with our committed capital and other co-investment arrangements, we are obligated to put a certain amount of our assets at risk in relation to the credit performance of the underlying loans. The risk in these arrangements is subject to a dollar cap, which represents the Company’s maximum exposure to losses in a particular arrangement. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s aggregate maximum exposure to losses was $459.3 million. Refer to “
Note 4.  Beneficial Interests
” in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details on our committed capital and co-investment arrangements. Our cash requirements for the next 12 months related to investments in these existing arrangements is estimated to be up to $210.0 million.
While we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months, our future capital requirements will depend on multiple factors, including our revenue growth, working capital requirements, volume of loan purchases for product development purposes or during market downturns, and our capital expenditures. We may decide to raise additional capital through the sale of equity, equity-linked or debt securities or other debt financing arrangements. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, our stockholders may experience dilution. Future debt financing, if available, may involve covenants restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt. Any debt or equity financing that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders. Further, if we are unable to raise additional capital when our cash and cash equivalents balances and cash generated by operations are insufficient to satisfy liquidity needs, our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely impacted.

Net Cash from Operating Activities 
Our main sources of cash provided by operating activities are our revenue from fees earned under contracts with lending partners and institutional investors and interest income we receive for loans held on our balance sheet. 
Our main uses of cash in our operating activities include payments to marketing partners, vendor payments, payroll and other personnel-related expenses, payments for facilities, and other general business expenditures. 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $186.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, which consisted of adjustments for non-cash items of $253.4 million, $61.5 million in net changes in operating assets and liabilities, and net loss of $128.6 million. The increase in non-cash adjustments was primarily related to $125.0 million of changes in fair value of loans held on the Company’s balance sheet, $133.4 million of stock-based compensation, $20.5 million of depreciation and amortization, and $16.5 million of changes in fair value of servicing assets, partially offset by $33.4 million of gain on debt extinguishment. The increase in net changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily related to $192.9 million in principal payments received for loans held-for-sale, $48.0 million in principal payments received for loans held in consolidated securitization, and $44.1 million of changes in accrued expenses and other liabilities, partially offset by $207.3 million of net payments from purchase and sale of loans held-for-sale, $8.7 million of changes in other assets, and $6.7 million of payments on beneficial interest liabilities.
Net Cash from Investing Activities 
Net cash used in investing activities was $237.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as a result of $323.1 million purchases and originations of loans held-for-investment and $63.3 million acquisition of beneficial interest assets, partially offset by $145.3 million in principal payments received for loans held-for-investment.
Net Cash from Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $559.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 primarily due to $909.5 million of proceeds from issuance of the 2029 and 2030 Notes, net of debt issuance costs and $387.3 million of proceeds from warehouse borrowings, partially offset by $357.4 million repayments of warehouse borrowings, $325.3 million of payments for repurchases of convertible notes, and $55.4 million of principal payments made on securitization notes. 
Composition of Balance Sheet Loan Portfolio 
As of December 31, 2024, we held $806.3 million of loans on our consolidated balance sheet. $455.2 million of these loans were originated for research and development purposes, primarily in support of our auto lending products, HELOCs, and expansion of our unsecured personal loan product to new categories of

(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted)
borrowers. We also held $248.2 million of core personal loans which would otherwise be immediately purchased by institutional investors and $102.9 million of core personal loans held by the consolidated securitization. We will continue to utilize our capital to support research and development activities and, at times, as a funding source for core personal loans during periods of marketplace funding constraints. The extent and timing of utilizing our capital as a funding source for loans will largely depend on the availability of capital in our marketplace relative to the demand from qualified borrowers and our business priorities. We plan to sell loans held on our balance sheet to institutional investors over time in the form of secondary sales or securitizations. 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
In the ordinary course of business, we engage in activities that are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets, generally referred to as off-balance sheet arrangements. These activities involve transactions with unconsolidated VIEs, including sale of whole loans, committed capital and other co-investment arrangements, and sponsored and co-sponsored securitization transactions, which we contractually service. We use these transactions to provide a source of liquidity to finance our business and to diversify our institutional investor base. If we are the retaining sponsor of a securitization transaction, we are required by law to retain at least 5% of the credit risk of the securities issued in these securitizations. We provide additional information regarding transactions with unconsolidated VIEs in “
Note 3.  Variable Interest Entities
” in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from our estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. Our significant accounting policies are described in “
Note 1.  Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies
” in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value determination requires the selection and use of valuation techniques and inputs subject to judgments and estimates that can significantly affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. 
The Company considers determination of fair value of loans, payable to securitization note holders, and beneficial interests as critical accounting policies. We use a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. The model uses observable and unobservable inputs and reflects our best estimates of the assumptions a market participant would use to calculate fair value. Fair value of loans and payable to securitization note holders is based on inputs, such as discount rates, credit risk rates, and expected prepayment rates. These inputs are based on historical performance of loans facilitated through our platform, as well as the consideration of market participant requirements and use of observable market data for notes payable held in consolidated securitization. Fair value of beneficial interests, which represent the Company’s right to receive cash payments or an obligation to make cash payments as part of its committed capital and other co-investment arrangements with third parties, is based on discount rates and credit risk rate spreads. Credit risk rate spreads are the measurement of estimated credit performance of underlying loan portfolios as of the reporting date against set expectations.
For further information on fair value measurement refer to “
Note 5.  Fair Value Measurement

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business, which primarily relate to fluctuations in market discount rates, credit risks, and interest rates. We are exposed to market risk directly through loans and securities held on our consolidated balance sheets, access to the securitization markets, institutional investor demand for loans facilitated through our marketplace, and availability of funding under our warehouse credit facilities. Our inability or failure to manage market risks could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
Discount Rate Risk 
Discount rate sensitivity refers to the risk of loss to future earnings, values or future cash flows that may result from changes in market discount rates. 
As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, we were exposed to market discount rate risk on $977.3 million and $703.4 million, respectively, of loans held on our consolidated balance sheets, excluding loans held in consolidated securitization. The fair value of these loans is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology, where the discount rate represents an estimate of the required rate of return by market participants. The changes in the discount rates for loans held on our balance sheet reflect the expected returns of similar financial instruments available in the market and can be caused by changes in the market interest rates, expected loan performance, and other factors. Any gains and losses from discount rate changes are recorded in earnings. A hypothetical 100 basis point and 200 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a $11.7 million and $23.1 million decrease, respectively, in the fair value of loans as of December 31, 2023 and a $9.0 million and $17.9 million decrease, respectively, as of December 31, 2024.
As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, we held $179.1 million and $102.9 million, respectively, of loans held in the consolidated securitization which are included in loans, at fair value, on the consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of these loans is determined by the sum of the fair value of the related securitization notes and residual certificates issued as part of the consolidated securitization, and uses the same projected net cash flows as the underlying collateral loan pool. As the Company retained all residual certificates issued by the consolidated securitization, their value is eliminated as part of the consolidation process. A hypothetical 100 basis point and 200 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a $2.4 million and $4.8 million decrease, respectively, in the fair value of loans held in the consolidated securitization as of December 31, 2023, and a $1.1 million and $2.3 million decrease, respectively, as of December 31, 2024. 
As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, we were also exposed to market discount rate risk on payable to securitization note holders of $141.4 million and $87.3 million, respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point and 200 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a $1.9 million and $3.7 million decrease, respectively, in the fair value of payable to securitization holders on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, and do not result in a material impact to the fair value of payable to securitization note holders as of December 31, 2024. 
As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, we were also exposed to market discount rate risk on other financial instruments, including $41.0 million and $176.8 million of beneficial interest assets, respectively. Beneficial interest assets are estimated at fair value using a discounted cash flow model which considers projected defaults, losses and recoveries to project future losses and net cash flows on the underlying loans. We use two different discount rates for expected cash flows associated with demonstrated to-date credit performance and those associated with future credit performance. Any gains and losses from discount rate changes are recorded in earnings. A hypothetical 100 basis point and 200 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a $1.2 million and $2.4 million decrease, respectively, in the fair value of beneficial interest assets as of December 31, 2023, and a $3.2 million and $6.4 million decrease, respectively, as of December 31, 2024.

Credit Risk 
Credit risk refers to the risk of loss of loans arising from individual borrower default due to inability or unwillingness to meet their financial obligations. The performance of certain financial instruments, including loans, beneficial interests, securitization notes and residual certificates, and payable to securitization note holders on our consolidated balance sheets are dependent on the credit performance of loans facilitated by us. To manage this risk, we monitor borrower payment performance through our lending marketplace and utilize our AI capabilities to price loans in a manner that we believe is reflective of their credit risk. 
The fair values of these loans, beneficial interests, securitization notes and residual certificates, and payable to securitization note holders are estimated based on a discounted cash flow model which involves the use of significant unobservable inputs and assumptions. These instruments are sensitive to changes in credit risk. 
As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, we were exposed to credit risk on $977.3 million and $703.4 million, respectively, of loans held on our consolidated balance sheets, excluding loans held in consolidated securitization. Loans bear fixed interest rates and are carried on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value. As of December 31, 2023, a hypothetical 10% and 20% increase in credit risk would result in a $12.5 million and $25.0 million decrease, and as of December 31, 2024, a hypothetical 10% and 20% increase in credit risk would result in a $9.1 million and $18.1 million decrease in the fair value of loans, respectively. 
As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, we held $179.1 million and $102.9 million, respectively, of loans held in the consolidated securitization which are included in loans, at fair value, on the consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of these loans is determined by the sum of the fair value of the related securitization notes and residual certificates issued by the consolidated entities, and uses the same projected net cash flows as the underlying collateral loan pool. As the Company retained all residual certificates issued by the consolidated securitization, the residual certificates value is eliminated as part of the consolidation process. A hypothetical 10% and 20% increase in the credit risk would result in a $2.7 million and $5.2 million decrease, respectively, in the fair value of loans held in consolidated securitization as of December 31, 2023 and a $1.8 million and $3.6 million decrease, respectively, as of December 31, 2024. 
We are also exposed to credit risk through credit risk rate spreads on beneficial interest assets and beneficial interest liabilities held on the consolidated balance sheet of $41.0 million and $4.2 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2023, and $176.8 million and $10.1 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2024. These assets and liabilities are associated with committed capital and other co-investment arrangements with institutional investors and lending partners, in which the Company puts certain amounts of assets at risk. See “
Note 4.  Beneficial Interests
” for additional information on maximum exposure to losses from these arrangements. A hypothetical 10% and 20% adverse change in credit risk spread would result in a $9.1 million and $16.7 million decrease, respectively, in the fair value of beneficial interest assets held on our consolidated balance sheet, and would result in a $5.6 million and $11.2 million increase in the fair value of beneficial interest liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, respectively, as of December 31, 2023. A hypothetical 10% and 20% adverse change in credit risk spread would result in a $44.4 million and $89.6 million decrease, respectively, in the fair value of beneficial interest assets, and would result in a $4.7 million and $10.3 million increase in the fair value of beneficial interest liabilities, respectively, as of December 31, 2024. 
Counterparty Risk
We are subject to risk that arises from our derivative financial instruments, line of credit receivable, beneficial interests, warehouse facilities, and third-party custodians. These activities generally involve an exchange of obligations with unaffiliated lenders or other individuals or entities, referred to in such transactions as “counterparties”. If a counterparty were to default or otherwise fail to perform, we could potentially be exposed to loss if such counterparty were unable to meet its obligations to us. We manage this risk by selecting only counterparties that we believe to be financially strong, spreading the risk among multiple such counterparties, and placing contractual limits on the amount of dependence on any single counterparty.

Table of Contents
Upstart Holdings, Inc.
As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, we held $467.8 million and $976.3 million, respectively, related to cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in business checking accounts and interest-bearing deposit accounts as well as money market accounts at various financial institutions in the United States. We are exposed to credit risk in the event of default by these financial institutions to the extent the amount recorded on our consolidated balance sheets exceeds the insured amounts by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC. We reduce credit risk by placing our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in reputable institutions.
As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, $62.7 million and $137.4 million, respectively, of the Company’s cash was held by one of our institutional investors in relation to the line of credit receivable and the beneficial interest asset. We mitigate our risk exposure through corporate guarantees provided by the investor.
Interest Rate Risk 
An increase in interest rates typically results in an increase in the rate of return required by lending partners and institutional investors, and therefore leads to a decrease in borrower demand. Higher interest rates also correspond with higher payment obligations for borrowers, which may reduce the ability of individual borrowers to remain current on their obligations, leading to increased delinquencies, defaults, borrower bankruptcies and charge-offs, and decreasing recoveries, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We expect these outcomes would generally invert in an environment of decreasing interest rates.
An increase or decrease in interest rates may also impact our exposure to interest rate risk on our warehouse credit facilities. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, we were exposed to interest rate risk on $387.4 million and $195.6 million, respectively, under our warehouse credit facilities, which bear floating interest rates. Changes in interest rates may impact our cost of borrowing. We have entered into interest rate cap agreements in connection with certain warehouse credit facilities with an aggregate notional amount of $241.1 million. The interest rate caps provide protection for certain credit facilities against exposure to changes in cash flows to the extent the 1-month SOFR exceeds the strike rate. The Upstart Auto Warehouse Trust interest rate cap matures in April 2029 and the Upstart Loan Trust interest rate cap matures June 2025. Refer to 
“Note 9.  Interest Rate Cap Arrangements”
 for further details.
Equity Investment Risk 
Our non-marketable equity securities are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could substantially reduce or increase the carrying value of our investments. 
Our non-marketable equity investments are in equity securities of privately-held companies without readily determinable fair values. We elected to account for each such investment using the measurement alternative which is cost less impairment, if any, and adjusted for changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer. The determination of whether an orderly transaction is for an identical or similar investment requires significant management judgment and is inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data. We consider factors such as differences in the rights and preferences of the investments and the extent to which those differences would affect the fair values of each investment. We also assess our non-marketable equity securities for impairment on a quarterly basis. Our impairment analysis encompasses an assessment of both qualitative and quantitative factors including the investee's financial metrics, market acceptance of the investee's product or technology, general market conditions and liquidity considerations. Adjustments and impairments are recorded in other expense on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss upon recognition of such adjustments or impairments. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities, which do not have readily determinable fair values, totaled $41.3 million.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Upstart Holdings, Inc. 
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Upstart Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 13, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion 
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter 
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Valuation of Loans and Beneficial Interests and Unobservable Inputs Therein 
– Loans at Fair Value – See Notes 1 and 5 
– Beneficial Interests at Fair Value – See Notes 1, 4 and 5
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company has elected the fair value option for loans and beneficial interests, which are valued using unobservable inputs significant to the fair value measurement. The Company estimates the fair value of loans and beneficial interests using a discounted cash flow model based on the present value of estimated future cash flows.
117
The fair value methodology for loans considers historical defaults, losses and recoveries to project future losses and net cash flows on loans that are discounted using an estimate of market rates of return. Primary inputs that require significant judgment include discount rates and credit risk rates. These inputs are based on historical performance of loans facilitated through the Company’s platform, management’s consideration of market participant requirements and use of observable market data for notes payable related to valuation of loans held in the consolidated securitization.
Primary inputs related to the beneficial interests that require significant judgment include discount rates and credit risk rate spreads. Credit risk rate spreads are the measurement of estimated credit performance of underlying loan portfolios as of the reporting date against set expectations. The discount rate is the market rates of return that reflect the risk premium related to the cash flows, and reflect the Company’s best estimates of the assumptions a market participant would use to determine fair value of its beneficial interests.
Given the significant judgments made by management in selecting the unobservable inputs used in estimating fair value of the loans and beneficial interests, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s judgments related to the selection of the discount rates, and credit risk rates for loans and discount rates and credit risk rate spreads for beneficial interests required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the unobservable inputs used by management to estimate the fair value of the loans and beneficial interests included the following, among others: 
•
We tested the effectiveness of management’s internal controls relating to estimation of the fair value of the loans and beneficial interests, including controls related to management’s selection of the discount rates and credit risk rates for loans and discount rates and credit risk rate spreads for beneficial interests.
•
We evaluated the accuracy and completeness of the data used in estimation of the fair value of the loans and beneficial interests.
•
With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we developed independent estimates of the fair value of the loans and beneficial interests, and compared our estimates to the Company’s estimates.

Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business 
Upstart Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (together “Upstart”, the “Company”, “management”, “we”, or “our”) apply artificial intelligence models and cloud applications to the process of underwriting consumer credit. The Company helps originate credit by providing lending partners with access to a proprietary, cloud-based, artificial intelligence lending marketplace. As the Company’s technology continues to improve and additional lending partners adopt the Upstart platform, consumers benefit from improved access to affordable and frictionless credit. The Company currently operates in the United States and is headquartered in San Mateo, California. The Company’s fiscal year ends on December 31. 
Basis of Presentation and Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and include the accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and consolidated VIEs. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The Company’s functional and reporting currency is the U.S. dollar.

Reclassifications 
During the second quarter of 2024, the Company elected to change its presentation of changes in the payable to investors balance on the consolidated statement of cash flows. Payable to investors balance consists of a) liabilities associated with fiduciary cash that is temporarily held by the Company on behalf of our institutional investors and is presented within restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets; and b) cash payable to investors for acquisitions or settlements of beneficial interests. Under the new presentation, the portion of the payable to investors balance related to fiduciary cash is reclassified from operating to financing activities within the consolidated statement of cash flows. There is no change in the presentation for the change in the payable to investors balance related to acquisition and settlements of beneficial interests. Comparative amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

The following tables present the effects of the changes in presentation within the consolidated statements of cash flows:

The reclassification had no impact on the consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss or consolidated statements of shareholders’ equity.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. 
Significant estimates and assumptions made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, which management believes are critical in understanding and evaluating the Company’s reported financial results include: (i) fair value determinations; (ii) stock-based compensation; (iii) consolidation of VIEs; and (iv) the evaluation for impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets. The Company bases its estimates on various factors it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences could affect the results of operations reported in future years.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash
Cash and cash equivalents consists of deposits held with financial institutions in checking and interest-bearing deposit accounts as well as money market accounts. The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Restricted cash primarily consists of deposit accounts that are held in our custody but restricted for regulatory or legal purposes. Restricted cash includes fiduciary funds received from borrowers for interest and principal applied to loans as part of loan servicing, but not yet distributed to institutional investors as well as collateral provided by institutional investors in relation to loan purchases. Restricted cash also consists of collateral for a letter of credit required under an operating lease agreement, cash received from borrowers for interest and principal applied to loans pledged to warehouse credit facilities, but not yet distributed to the Company, and cash balances restricted in connection with committed capital and other co-investment agreements.

Fair Value Measurement
Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis on the consolidated balance sheets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair values. Fair value 
127
Table of Contents

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted)
is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or an exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The price used to measure fair value is not adjusted for transaction costs. The principal market is the market in which the Company would sell or transfer the asset with the greatest volume and level of activity for the asset. In determining the principal market for an asset or liability, it is assumed that the Company has access to the market as of the measurement date. If no market for the asset exists, or if the Company does not have access to the principal market, a hypothetical market is used. 
The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements as follows: 
Level 1—Unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
Level 2— Inputs (other than quoted prices included in Level 1) are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and 
Level 3— Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. 
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis include loans, line of credit receivable, notes receivable and residual certificates, loan servicing assets and liabilities, derivatives, beneficial interests, payable to securitization note holders, and trailing fee liabilities. When developing fair value measurements, the Company maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs. 
However, for certain instruments, the Company must utilize unobservable inputs in determining fair value due to the lack of observable inputs in the market, which requires greater judgment in measuring fair value. In instances where there is limited or no observable market data, fair value measurements for assets and liabilities are based primarily upon the Company’s own estimates, and the measurements reflect information and assumptions that management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability.

Financial Instruments not Measured at Fair Value
The Company’s financial instruments not measured at fair value consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and other assets (excluding certain financial instruments, which are measured at fair value, such as line of credit receivable, loan servicing assets, interest rate caps, notes receivable and residual certificates), accounts payable, payable to investors, and other liabilities (excluding certain financial instruments, such as loan servicing liabilities, beneficial interest liabilities, and trailing fee liabilities which are measured at fair value). Payable to investors includes amounts of loan repayments not yet distributed to institutional investors, as well as amounts received from institutional investors but not yet invested directly in whole loans. The carrying values of these financial instruments approximates their respective fair values due to their short-term nature.
Borrowings are presented at par, net of debt issuance costs that are amortized over the contractual term using the effective interest method, with accrued interest included as part of accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value of borrowings associated with the warehouse credit facilities approximates the fair value due to their relatively short maturities.
Variable Interest Entities
A legal entity is considered a VIE if it has either a total equity investment that is insufficient to finance its operations without additional subordinated financial support or whose equity holders lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. The Company’s variable interests arise from contractual, ownership, or other monetary 
128
Table of Contents

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted)
interests in the entity. The Company consolidates a VIE when it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The Company determines it is the primary beneficiary if it has the power to direct activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could be potentially significant to the VIE. The Company assesses whether or not it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing basis. 
Consolidated Securitization
The Company elected the measurement alternative under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 810, 
Consolidation
, and maximizes the use of observable inputs to estimate the fair value of the financial assets and liabilities of a consolidated securitization entity. Under the measurement alternative, the Company determined that the fair value of the liabilities, which consists of securitization notes and residual certificates issued by the entity, is based on more observable inputs than inputs used to determine the fair value of the assets, which consists of held-for-sale loans. Thus, the fair value of these loans is determined by the sum of the fair value of the related securitization notes and residual certificates. The fair value is corroborated with discounted cash flow that considers projected prepayments and historical defaults, losses and recoveries to project future losses and net cash flows on loans, discounted using an estimate of market rates of return. The value of residual certificates issued and retained by the Company is eliminated upon consolidation. Changes in the fair value of these assets and liabilities are included in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 
Transfer of Financial Assets
Upstart-powered loans originated by lending partners are either retained by the lending partners, purchased by the Company and immediately sold to institutional investors under loan sale agreements, or purchased and held by the Company for a period of time before being sold to third-party investors, or held to maturity by the Company for the primary purpose of product research and development. Loans held on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets are classified as either held-for-investment or held-for-sale, and loans purchased for immediate resale to third-party investors are classified as held-for-sale. Immediate loan resales to institutional investors are accounted for as transfers of financial assets when the Company surrenders control of these loan assets. These sales typically occur shortly after the origination of the loans by the lending partner and the Company’s subsequent acquisition of the loans from the originating lending partner. Loans sold to institutional investors are derecognized from the Company’s consolidated balance sheets at the time of sale in accordance with the ASC 860, 
Transfers and Servicing
. The Company records an asset or a liability at fair value for its estimated post-sale servicing arrangements.

Loan Servicing Assets and Liabilities
Loan servicing assets and liabilities are recognized at fair value when the Company transfers loans, which qualify as sales under ASC 860 with servicing rights retained or when the Company enters into servicing agreements with lending partners who retain Upstart-powered loans. A loan servicing asset or liability exists depending on whether the revenue from servicing is expected to more than adequately compensate the Company for carrying out its servicing obligations. 
Loan servicing assets and liabilities are recorded in other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets, with changes in fair value recorded in servicing revenue, net, which is part of revenue from fees, net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

Note 2.  Revenue

Property, Equipment, and Software, Net 
Property, equipment, and software are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are generally 
three years
 for internally developed software, computer and networking equipment, and furniture and fixtures. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life.

Internally developed software is capitalized upon completion of the preliminary project stage, when it becomes probable that the project will be completed, and the software will be used as intended. Capitalized costs primarily consist of salaries and payroll related costs for employees directly involved in development efforts. Costs related to the preliminary project stage and activities occurring after the implementation of the software are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred for software upgrades are capitalized if they result in additional functionalities or substantial enhancements.

The Company evaluates its long-lived assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. When such an event occurs the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its estimated fair value.
Leases
The Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets with right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying asset and lease liabilities representing the obligation to make lease payments. Right-of-use assets (“ROU”) and lease liabilities are recognized at lease commencement primarily based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term, and as necessary, at modification. The operating lease ROU assets also include any initial direct costs, lease payments made prior to lease commencement, and lease incentives received. Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred and are not included within the ROU asset and lease liability calculation. Variable lease payments primarily include reimbursements of costs incurred by lessors for common area maintenance and utilities. The Company’s lease terms are the non-cancelable period including any rent-free periods provided by the lessor and may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that it will exercise that option. At lease inception, and in subsequent periods as necessary, the Company estimates the lease term based on its assessment of extension and termination options that are reasonably certain to be exercised. Lease costs for lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. As the rate implicit on the Company’s leases is not readily determinable, the Company uses its secured incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term and in a similar economic environment. 
The Company has elected not to separate lease and non-lease components for any leases within its existing classes of assets and, as a result, accounts for any lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. The Company has immaterial leases with a term of 12 months or less.

Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company evaluates its contracts and financial instruments to determine if these contracts and instruments or their parts meet the definition of derivatives in accordance with the requirements of ASC 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging
. Derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with changes in the value recorded in earnings on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, and are reported within the net cash used in operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage risks related to our ongoing business operations, including managing 
130
Table of Contents
Upstart Holdings, Inc. 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted)
interest rates on our warehouse facilities. The Company does not employ derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and has no derivatives classified as accounting hedges.
Beneficial Interests
Beneficial interests represent the Company’s right to receive cash payments from or an obligation to make cash payments to certain institutional investors and lending partners based on the credit performance of the underlying loan portfolios. The Company evaluates these arrangements to determine if they or their components meet the characteristics of derivative financial instruments. 
In certain arrangements, the Company is obligated to make payments to these third-parties or is entitled to receive payments from them if credit performance of the loans sold or originated under the arrangements deviates from initial expectations set at the time of loan sale or origination. These arrangements meet the definition of derivatives under ASC 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging
, and are measured at their fair value. Under other arrangements, the Company makes an initial investment and is entitled to a portion of cash flows from repayments received over time on the underlying loan portfolios sold under theses arrangements. These cash flows vary depending on the demonstrated credit performance relative to our expectations. These arrangements are debt-like financial instruments with embedded derivatives related to the variability of demonstrated credit performance of underlying loan portfolios against initial expectations. The Company elected to account for these hybrid instruments at fair value under ASC 825, 
Financial Instruments
. For all arrangements, changes in fair value and other adjustments are recognized on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
 Refer to “
Note 4.  Beneficial Interests
” and “
Note 5.  Fair Value Measurement
” for additional information. 
Non-marketable Equity Securities
The Company’s strategic investments consists of non-marketable equity securities on the consolidated balance sheets which are investments in privately held companies. Non-marketable equity securities do not have a readily determinable fair value and are measured by the Company at cost less impairment, if any, and adjusted for changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer (the “measurement alternative”). Gains and losses on the investment, realized and unrealized, are recognized in other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss and a new carrying value is established for the investment upon such recognition of the gains and losses. There have been no unrealized or realized gains and losses or impairments related to the non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the measurement alternative for the years presented. 
The determination of whether an orderly transaction is for an identical or similar investment requires significant management judgment. In its evaluation, the Company considers factors such as differences in the rights and preferences of the investment and the extent to which those differences would affect the fair value of the investment. In the event the Company identifies an observable price change from an orderly transaction for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer, the Company must estimate the fair value of its strategic investments using the most recent data available. The Company’s impairment analysis encompasses an assessment of both qualitative and quantitative factors.

Business Combinations
The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting which requires the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recognized at their estimated fair value as of the acquisition date. The excess purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of fair values may be subject to adjustment after the initial allocation for up to a one-year period, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Acquisition-related costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently if an event or a change in circumstances indicates that goodwill may be impaired. We first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Examples of qualitative factors include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, a significant decline in our stock price, a significant decline in our projected revenue or cash flows, or the presence of other indicators that would indicate a reduction in the fair value of a reporting unit. If the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is performed. We perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test by determining the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it to the carrying value of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than the reporting unit’s carrying value, then the carrying value of the reporting unit is deemed to be recoverable. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is greater than the reporting unit’s fair value, goodwill is impaired and written down to the reporting unit’s fair value. 
Acquired intangible assets are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Acquired intangible assets are presented net of accumulated amortization on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company reviews the carrying amounts of intangible assets for impairment whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. We measure the recoverability of intangible assets by comparing the carrying amount of each asset to the future undiscounted cash flows we expect the asset to generate. Impairment is measured by the amount in which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. In addition, we periodically evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of long-lived intangible assets to determine whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization.
Revenue Recognition
The Company’s revenue consists of 
two
 components: revenue from fees, net and interest income, interest expense, and fair value adjustments, net. The revenue from fees, net line item on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss is primarily comprised of platform and referral fees, net, which are recognized in accordance with ASC 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers, 
and servicing and other fees, net, which are accounted for under ASC 860,
 Transfers and Servicing.
 Refer to “
Note 2.  Revenue
” for further information.
Operating Expenses 
Sales and Marketing

Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of costs incurred across various advertising channels, including expenses for partnerships with third-parties providing borrower referrals, direct mail and digital advertising campaigns, as well as other expenses associated with building overall brand awareness and experiential marketing costs. Sales and marketing expenses also include payroll and other personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, for related teams. These costs are recognized in the period incurred.
Customer Operations

Customer operations expenses include payroll and other personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation expense, for personnel engaged in onboarding, loan servicing, customer support and other related operational teams. These costs also include costs of third-party collection agencies and other systems and tools the Company uses as part of information verification, fraud detection, and payment processing activities. These costs are recognized in the period incurred.

Engineering and Product Development 
Engineering and product development expenses primarily consist of payroll and other employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation expenses, for the engineering and product development teams as well as the costs of systems and tools used by these teams. These costs are recognized in the period incurred. 
General, Administrative, and Other 
General, administrative, and other expenses consist primarily of payroll and other employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation expense for legal and compliance, finance and accounting, human resources and facilities teams, as well as depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and software, professional services fees, facilities and travel expenses. These costs are recognized in the period incurred.

Stock-Based Compensation 
The Company issues stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) to employees and non-employees, including directors and third-party service providers, and employee stock purchase rights granted under the Company’s employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”). The Company also had previously granted performance-based restricted stock units (“PRSUs”). Stock options and employee stock purchase rights granted under the ESPP are initially measured at fair value at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. RSUs and restricted stock are measured at the fair market value of our common stock at the grant date. PRSUs are initially measured at fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Stock-based compensation expenses are recognized based on their respective grant-date fair values. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, as necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures, such that the expense is recorded only for those awards that are expected to vest.

Other Income, Net
Other income, net primarily consists of dividend income earned by the Company on its unrestricted cash and cash equivalents balance which is recognized in the period earned.

Income Taxes 
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. 
The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance may be established to reduce the deferred tax asset to the level at which it is “more likely than not” that the tax asset or benefits will be realized. Realization of tax benefits of deductible temporary differences and operating loss carryforwards depends on having sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character within the carryback or carryforward periods. 
The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon review by the taxing authority. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.

Net Loss Per Share
The Company follows the two-class method when computing net loss per common share when shares are issued that meet the definition of participating securities. The two-class method determines net income (loss) per common share for each class of common stock and participating securities according to dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The two-class method requires income available to common stockholders for the year to be allocated between common stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the year had been distributed. 
Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the year.
Diluted net loss per share is the amount of net loss available to each share of common stock outstanding during the reporting year, adjusted to include the effect of potentially dilutive common shares. Potentially dilutive common shares include incremental shares issued for stock options, unvested RSUs, purchase rights committed under the ESPP, and convertible debt. The calculation of diluted net loss per share excludes all anti-dilutive common shares. For years in which the Company reports net losses, basic and diluted net loss per share are the same because potentially dilutive common shares are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive.

Platform and Referral Fees, Net
Lending Partners. 
The Company enters into contracts with lending partners to provide access to a cloud-based artificial intelligence lending marketplace developed by the Company (the “Upstart platform”) to enable lending partners to originate unsecured personal and secured auto refinance loans. The Upstart platform includes a cloud-based application (through Upstart.com or a lending partner-branded program) for submitting loan applications, verifying information provided within submitted applications, risk underwriting (through a series of proprietary technology solutions), delivery of electronic loan offers, and if the offer is accepted by the borrower, electronic loan documentation signed by the borrower. Lending partners can specify certain parameters of loans they are willing to originate. Under these contracts, lending partners can choose to use Upstart’s referral services, which allow them to access new borrowers through Upstart’s marketing channels.
After origination, Upstart-powered loans are either retained by lending partners, purchased by the Company for immediate resale to institutional investors under loan sale agreements, or purchased and held by the Company. For loans not retained by the lending partners, the Company pays the lending partners a one-time loan premium fee upon completion of the minimum contractual holding period and a monthly loan trailing fee based on the amount and timing of principal and interest payments made by the borrowers of the underlying loans. Both the loan premium fees and loan trailing fees are consideration payable to customers, which are our lending partners, and are recorded as a reduction to platform and referral fees, net, which is part of revenue from fees, net, in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The Company recognized $
27.7
 million, $
8.1
 million, and $
11.5
 million of loan premium fees and loan trailing fees as contra-revenue within platform and referral fees, net during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively.

The Company recognized $
4.3
 million and $
4.6
 million of loan trailing fee liability as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, which is recorded at fair value and included within accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Refer to “
Note 5.  Fair Value Measurement
” for additional information on changes in fair value associated with trailing fee liabilities. 
The Company’s arrangements for platform and referral services typically consist of an obligation to provide one or both of these services to customers, on a when and if needed basis (a stand-ready obligation), and revenue is recognized as such services are performed. Additionally, the services have the same pattern and period of transfer, and when provided individually or together, are accounted for as a single combined performance obligation representing a series of distinct services. 
Platform and referral services are typically provided under a fixed or variable price per unit based on a percentage of the value of loans originated each period with certain lending partners subject to minimum fees; however, pricing for these services may also be based on usage fees, calculated as a percentage of each loan originated. The nature of the Company’s promise is to stand-ready and provide continuous access to and process transactions through the platform. Platform and referral fees represent variable consideration as loan origination volume is not known at contract inception. These fees are determined each time a loan is originated. Fees for platform and referral services are typically billed and paid on a monthly basis. As such, the Company’s contracts with customers do not include a significant financing component. 
Auto Dealerships.
 The Company enters into subscription agreements with auto dealerships to access Upstart Auto Retail software, a cloud-based solution that facilitates dealership operations and enables them to provide consumers with access to Upstart-powered auto loans. Subscription agreements generally have a contractual term of 
one
 to 
six months
 with evergreen monthly renewals. The Company bills customers on a monthly basis. Subscription fees are recognized over the contract term as the performance obligation is satisfied, and is included within platform and referral fees, net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The Company recognized an 
immaterial
 amount, $
3.8
 million, and 
$
5.4
 million of subscription fee revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively.
The Company had $
19.5
 million and $
19.0
 million of accounts receivable that are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets related to contracts with customers as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively. The standard payment terms on accounts receivable are 30 days. The Company’s allowance for bad debt and bad debt expense were immaterial for the years presented. 
The Company capitalizes incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer, which are certain sales commissions paid to employees in connection with the acquisition of lending partners. Capitalized costs are amortized over the expected period of benefit, which we have determined, based on an analysis, to be 
three years
. The Company applies the practical expedient to expense costs to obtain contracts with customers if the amortization period is one year or less. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, the Company had $
2.7
 million and $
2.5
 million of contract costs, respectively, capitalized within other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, the Company recognized an amortization expense of $
2.8
 million, $
3.2
 million, and an $
3.2
 million, respectively, of capitalized contracts costs to sales and marketing in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the years presented.

Servicing and Other Fees, Net
The Company also enters into contracts with lending partners and institutional investors to provide loan servicing for the life of Upstart-powered loans. These services commence upon origination of these loans by lending partners and include collection, processing and reconciliations of payments received, institutional investor reporting and borrower customer support as well as distribution of funds to the holders of the loans. The Company charges the loan holder a monthly servicing fee calculated based on a predetermined percentage of the outstanding principal balance. Servicing fees also include certain ancillary fees charged on a per transaction basis for processing late payments and payments declined due to insufficient funds. Servicing fees are recognized in the period the services are provided. Loan servicing fees are not within the scope of ASC 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
, and are accounted for under ASC 860, 
Transfers and Servicing
.
The Company charges lending partners and institutional investors for collection agency fees related to their outstanding loan portfolio. The Company either performs borrower collection activities in-house, or outsources to third-party collection agencies particularly for loans that are more than 30 days past due or charged off. The Company has discretion in hiring the collection agencies and determining the scope of their work. As the principal in the arrangement, the Company recognizes gross revenue from collection agency fees in the period that the services are provided. Upstart also receives certain ancillary borrower fees inclusive of late payment fees and ACH fail fees. The total fees charged by collection agencies are recognized in the period incurred and reported as part of customer operations expenses.
Servicing and other fees, net also includes gains and losses on assets and liabilities recognized under loan servicing arrangements for loans retained by lending partners or loans sold to institutional investors. Such gains or losses are recognized based on whether the benefits of servicing are expected to be more or less than adequate compensation for servicing obligations performed by the Company. Servicing fees also include changes in fair value of loan servicing assets and liabilities. Refer to “
Note 5.  Fair Value Measurement
” for additional information on changes in fair value associated with servicing assets and liabilities.

Interest Income
Interest income is recognized based on the terms of the underlying agreements with borrowers for loans and line of credit receivable held on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and is earned over the life of a loan or a line of credit receivable. 
Interest income also includes accrued interest earned on outstanding loans and line of credit receivable but not collected. Home equity lines of credit (“HELOCs”) that have reached a delinquency over 
180
 days and all other loans and line of credit receivable that have reached a delinquency over 
120
 days are charged off and do not accrue interest. The Company does not record an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, the Company has recorded $
14.2
 million and $
8.2
 million of accrued interest income in 
loans
 on the consolidated balance sheets, respectively. Accrued interest income on the line of credit receivable was immaterial as of December 31, 2024.
Interest Expense
Interest expense is primarily related to interest recorded on the Company’s borrowings on warehouse credit facilities and interest expense related to the consolidated securitization. Interest expense includes accrued interest incurred but not paid.  Interest expense also includes changes in fair value of the interest rate caps. Refer to “
Note 9.  Interest Rate Cap Arrangements
”

for additional information. Accrued interest expenses for the warehouses were 
immaterial
 as of December 31, 2023 and 2024.
Fair Value and Other Adjustments, Net
Fair value and other adjustments, net include changes in fair value of financial instruments, other than loan servicing assets and liabilities and interest rate caps. These adjustments are recorded in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss and include both realized and unrealized changes to the value of related assets and liabilities. Refer to “
Note 5.  Fair Value Measurement
” for additional information. 
Fair value and other adjustments, net also includes amounts received from borrowers for previously charged-off loans held on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. These amounts are recognized in the period when amounts are received. Amounts received from borrowers for previously charged-off loans were

Variable Interest Entities
Consolidated VIEs
The Company consolidates VIEs in which the Company has a variable interest and is determined to be the primary beneficiary. This determination is based on whether the Company has a variable interest (or combination of variable interests) that provides the Company with both (a) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to the VIE. The Company continually reassesses whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE throughout the entire period the Company is involved with the VIE. 
The Company also determines whether decision-maker or service-provider fees are variable interests. Decision-maker or service-provider fees are not considered variable interests when the arrangement does not expose the Company to risks of loss that a potential VIE was designed to pass on to its variable interest holders, the fees are commensurate, the arrangement is at market, and the Company does not have any other interests (including direct interests and certain indirect interests held through related parties) that absorb more than an insignificant amount of a VIE’s potential variability. This determination can have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidation analysis, as it could affect whether a legal entity is a VIE and whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. When the Company’s decision-maker or service-provider fee is not a variable interest, the Company is viewed as acting as a fiduciary for the potential VIE.

Consolidated Securitization
On July 6, 2023, the Company completed a private securitization securities offering (“UPST 2023-2”). As a retaining sponsor of the transaction, under risk retention requirements in Title 17 U.S. 
Code of Federal Regulations
 Part 246, Credit Risk Retention, promulgated by the SEC, the Company is required to retain at least 5% of the economic risk in UPST 2023-2. The Company elected to satisfy the risk retention requirements by holding eligible vertical retained interests in the form of a combination of securitization notes and residual certificates. The Company has also retained the remainder of the residual certificates issued as part of the transaction. The Company was the sole contributor of the collateral, which included $
204.7
 million outstanding principal balance of Upstart-powered loans held by the Company. The weighted-average coupon of the securitization notes issued was approximately 
140
Table of Contents
Upstart Holdings, Inc. 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted)
9.2
%, and their sale generated approximately $
165.3
 million in gross cash proceeds. These proceeds and payments made on securitization notes are classified as financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
The retained interests in UPST 2023-2 held by the Company were deemed to potentially absorb more than an insignificant amount of expected losses or expected returns at the inception of the securitization transaction. The Company, as servicer, also has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economics of the entities associated with the UPST 2023-2 securitization, and as such, the Company determined it was the primary beneficiary and consolidated the entities associated with UPST 2023-2.
The loans held in the consolidated securitization trust are classified as held-for-sale and included in loans, at fair value, and the notes sold to third-party investors are recorded at fair value as payable to securitization note holders on the consolidated balance sheets. Refer to “
Note 5.  Fair Value Measurement
” for additional information on determination of fair value of these assets and liabilities. The value of the residual certificates issued as part of the securitization and retained by the Company was eliminated as part of the consolidation. 
Warehouse Entities
The Company established various entities deemed to be VIEs to enter into warehouse credit facilities for the purpose of purchasing Upstart-powered loans. Refer to “
Note 8.  Borrowings
” for additional information. These entities are Delaware statutory trusts that are structured to be bankruptcy-remote, with third-party banks operating as trustees. 
Other Consolidated VIE
The Company has formed a number of VIEs for the purpose of holding Upstart-powered loans that are not pledged or eligible to be pledged to the Company’s warehouse credit facilities. In addition, the Company has formed consolidated VIEs for the purpose of holding restricted cash or loans as collateral in connection with committed capital and other co-investment arrangements.
Unconsolidated VIEs
The Company’s transactions with unconsolidated VIEs include securitizations of unsecured personal whole loans and sales of whole loans to VIEs, including loan sales under its committed capital and other co-investment arrangements. Refer to “
Note 4.  Beneficial Interests
” for additional information on unconsolidated VIEs related to committed capital and other co-investment arrangements. 
Securitizations
While the Company continues to be involved with the unconsolidated VIEs in its role as the sponsor and the servicer of securitization transactions, the Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these entities. The Company’s unconsolidated VIEs include entities established as the issuers and grantor trusts for various securitization transactions. 
In cases where the VIEs are not consolidated and the transfer of the loans from the Company to the securitization trust meets sale accounting criteria, the Company recognizes a gain or loss on sales of loans. The net proceeds of the sale represent the fair value of any assets obtained or liabilities incurred as part of the transaction. The assets are transferred into a trust such that the assets are legally isolated from the creditors of the Company and are not available to satisfy obligations of the Company. These assets can only be used to settle obligations of the underlying securitization trusts. 
During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company exercised clean up calls related to 
two
 historical unconsolidated securitizations and subsequently liquidated the associated entities. As part of the clean up calls, the 
141
Table of Contents
Upstart Holdings, Inc. 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted)
Company, as servicer, repurchased the remaining collateral and received the cash reserve amounts held by the related entities. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company exercised clean up calls related to 
two
 unconsolidated securitizations and subsequently liquidated the associated entities. The clean up calls had no material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the years presented.
The following tables summarize the aggregate value of assets and liabilities of unconsolidated VIEs associated with securitizations in which the Company holds a variable interest but is not the primary beneficiary:

The Company’s maximum exposure to loss from its involvement with unconsolidated VIEs represents the value of securities retained and cash deposits made under the risk retention requirements for the related securitizations and estimates the loss that would be incurred under severe, hypothetical circumstances, for which the Company believes the possibility is remote. The carrying value of assets that relate to variable interests in unconsolidated VIEs consists of $
14.8
 million and $
22.1
 million of securitization notes and residual certificates that are carried at fair value and included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively. The Company also had $
6.0
 million and $
3.7
 million of cash deposits held as reserve accounts for related securitizations, included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively.
For securitization transactions where the Company is not the risk retaining sponsor, and servicing is the only form of continuing involvement, the Company would only experience a loss if it were required to repurchase a loan due to a breach in representations and warranties and is not able to collect all repayments, refer to “
Note 12.  Commitments and Contingencies
” for further information.
The investors and the securitization trusts have no direct recourse to the Company’s assets, and holders of the securities issued by the securitization trusts can look only to the assets of the securitization trusts that issued their securities for payment. The interests held by the Company and its affiliates are subject principally to the credit and prepayment risk stemming from the underlying unsecured personal whole loans.

 4.    
Beneficial Interests 
The Company’s beneficial interests are associated with committed capital and other co-investment arrangements with a number of third-party institutional investors and lending partners, in which the Company puts certain amounts of assets at risk. The risk is subject to a dollar cap, which represents the Company’s maximum exposure to losses in each particular arrangement.

In certain arrangements, the Company is obligated to make payments to these third-parties or is entitled to receive payments from them if credit performance of the loans sold or originated under the arrangements deviates from initial expectations set at the time of loan sale or origination. These arrangements meet the definition of derivatives under ASC 815 and can produce an asset or a liability depending on the credit performance of the underlying loan portfolio as of the reporting date, which are settled periodically in cash based on contractual terms. Under other arrangements, the Company makes an initial investment and is entitled to a portion of cash flows from repayments received over time on the underlying loan portfolios sold under theses arrangements. These cash flows vary depending on the demonstrated credit performance relative to our expectations. These arrangements are debt-like financial instruments with embedded derivatives related to the variability of demonstrated credit performance of underlying loan portfolios against initial expectations. The Company accounts for these derivatives and hybrid instruments at fair value under ASC 815 and ASC 825, respectively. Refer to “
Note 5.  Fair Value Measurement
” for additional information.
Beneficial interests represent the value of the future cash flows as part of these arrangements, discounted to the present value based on expected performance. 
The following table presents the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the underlying loan portfolios as well as the fair value of beneficial interest assets, by type, which collectively are presented as a separate asset line item on the consolidated balance sheets, and beneficial interest liabilities, which are presented in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.

The Company’s beneficial interests are associated with entities that meet the definition of a VIE or are evaluated under the voting interest model. The Company has variable interests in certain entities established in relation to its committed capital and co-investment arrangements, including purchaser trusts, which are unconsolidated VIEs. While the Company holds variable interests in these unconsolidated VIEs through committed capital and co-investment arrangements and as the servicer of the loans sold, the Company does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these entities. The Company additionally holds loans as collateral in connection with committed capital and other co-investment arrangements in a consolidated VIE. Refer to “
Note 3.  Variable Interest Entities
” for additional information. While held as collateral, these loans are ineligible to be sold and are classified as held-for-investment on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.

Financial instruments are categorized in the fair value hierarchy based on the significance of unobservable inputs and assumptions in the overall fair value measurement. Financial instruments classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy 
do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices. The Company uses significant unobservable inputs to measure the fair value of these assets and liabilities. 
There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the years presented. 
Loans
Loans included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets are classified as either held-for-sale or held-for-investment based on the Company’s intent and ability to sell the loans prior to maturity. From time to time, the Company transfers loans between the classification categories based on changes in the Company’s intent and ability. Loans held in the consolidated securitization include loans contributed as collateral to and held in the consolidated securitization (UPST 2023-2) and are classified as held-for-sale.

The following table presents the fair value of classes of loans included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2024:

Valuation Methodology
Loans held-for-sale and held-for-investment are measured at estimated fair value using a discounted cash flow model. The fair valuation methodology considers projected prepayments and historical defaults, losses and recoveries to project future losses and net cash flows on loans. Net cash flows are discounted using an estimate of market rates of return. The fair value of these loans also includes accrued interest. 
The Company elected the measurement alternative under Topic 810, 
Consolidation
, and maximizes the use of observable inputs to estimate the fair value of the financial assets and liabilities of UPST 2023-2. Under the measurement alternative, the Company determined that inputs and market data used to determine the value of UPST 2023-2 liabilities, which consist of securitization notes and residual certificates issued as part of this securitization, are more observable than those used to measure fair value of UPST 2023-2 financial assets, which consist of held-for-sale loans contributed as collateral. Thus, the loans are measured based on the sum of the fair value of the UPST 2023-2 securitization notes and residual certificates, with changes in fair value included in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The fair value is also corroborated with discounted cash flow that considers projected prepayments and historical defaults, losses and recoveries to project future losses and net cash flows on loans, discounted using an estimate of market rates of return as disclosed below in the Significant Inputs and Assumptions section. The fair value of loans in consolidated securitization also includes accrued interest.
Significant Inputs and Assumptions
The following table presents quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs used for the Company’s Level 3 fair value measurements for loans held-for-investment and held-for-sale, excluding loans held in consolidated securitization:

Discount rates
–The discount rates are rates of return used to discount future expected cash flows to arrive at a present value, which represents the fair value. The discount rates used for the projected net cash flows are the Company’s estimates of the rates of return that market participants would require when investing in these financial instruments with cash flows dependent on credit quality of the related loan. A risk premium component is implicitly included in the discount rates to reflect the amount of compensation market participants require due to the uncertainty inherent in the instruments’ cash flows resulting from risks such as credit and liquidity. 
Credit risk rates
–The credit risk rates are an estimate of the net cumulative principal payments that will not be repaid over the entire life of a financial instrument. The credit risk rates are expressed as a percentage of the original principal amount of the instrument. The estimated net cumulative loss represents the sum of the net losses estimated to occur each month of the life of the instrument, net of the average recovery expected to be received. 
Prepayment rates
–Prepayment rates are an estimate of the cumulative principal prepayments that will occur over the entire life of a loan as a percentage of the original principal amount of the loan. The assumption regarding cumulative prepayments impacts the projected balances and expected terms of the loans.

Line of Credit Receivable
 In connection with one of its committed capital and other co-investment arrangements, the Company issued a revolving line of credit receivable to a third-party, which is classified as held-for-investment and presented within other assets on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2024, the fair value of the line of credit receivable was $
56.3
 million. The Company held 
no
 line of credit receivable as of December 31, 2023.
Valuation Methodology
The line of credit receivable is measured at estimated fair value using a discounted cash flow model. The  model is based on the expected monthly outstanding balance of the line of credit receivable over the life of the agreement and considers the present creditworthiness of the counterparty and the difference between current interest rates and the stated interest rate. Cash flows are discounted using an estimate of market rates of return. The fair value of the line of credit receivable also includes accrued interest.

Assets and Liabilities related to Securitization Transactions
As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, the Company held notes receivable and residual certificates with an aggregate fair value of $
14.8
 million and $
22.1
 million, respectively, within other assets on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The balances consist of securitization notes and residual certificates retained from unconsolidated securitization transactions.
As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, the Company recognized payables to securitization note holders of $
141.4
 million and $
87.3
 million at fair value, respectively. The balance represents the value of the securitization notes issued and owned by third-party investors in connection with UPST 2023-2. The value of the UPST 2023-2 securitization notes and residual certificates retained by the Company is eliminated in the consolidation process. 
Valuation Methodology
The Company prioritizes the use of observable inputs in estimating the fair value of notes receivable and residual certificates and payable to securitization note holders when available. When market activity for these financial instruments is not observable, the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology. This approach uses assumptions of projected cash flows of the underlying collateral loan pools adjusted for features of these securities, which reflect the Company’s best estimates of the assumptions a market participant would use to determine fair value.

Significant Recurring Level 3 Fair Value Input Sensitivity
Notes Receivable and Residual Certificates
Adverse changes in discount rates, credit risk rates, or prepayment rates do not result in a material impact to the fair value of notes receivable and residual certificates as of December 31, 2023 and 2024.
Payable to Securitization Note Holders
The fair value of the payable to securitization note holders is sensitive to adverse changes in discount rates, which represent estimates of the rates of return that institutional investors would require when investing in financial instruments with similar risk and return characteristics. On average, a hypothetical 100 and 200 basis point increase in discount rates results in a decrease in fair value of payable to securitization note holders of $
1.9
 million and $
3.7
 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2023 and do 
not
 result in a material impact in the fair value of payable to securitization note holders as of December 31, 2024.

Loan Servicing Assets and Liabilities
As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, the Company’s loan servicing assets had a fair value of $
28.1
 million and $
27.4
 million, respectively, recorded within other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, the Company’s loan servicing liabilities had a fair value of $
2.0
 million and $
1.2
 million, respectively, recorded within accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
Valuation Methodology 
Loan servicing assets and liabilities are measured at estimated fair value using a discounted cash flow model. The cash flows in the valuation model represent the difference between the contractual servicing fees charged to institutional investors and an estimated market servicing fee. Since contractual servicing fees are generally based on the monthly outstanding principal balance of the underlying loans, the expected cash flows in the model incorporate estimates of net losses and prepayments.

Discount rates
–The discount rates are the Company’s estimate of the rates of return that market participants in servicing rights would require when investing in similar servicing rights. Discount rates for servicing rights on existing loans are adjusted to reflect the time value of money and a risk premium intended to reflect the amount of compensation market participants would require due to the uncertainty associated with these instruments’ cash flows.
Credit risk rate
s–The credit risk rates are the Company’s estimate of the net cumulative principal payments that will not be repaid over the entire life of a loan expressed as a percentage of the original principal amount of the loan. The assumption regarding net cumulative losses impacts the projected balances and expected terms of the loans, which are used to project future servicing revenues. 
Market-servicing rates
–Market-servicing rate is an estimated measure of adequate compensation for a market participant, if one was required. The rate is expressed as a fixed percentage of outstanding principal balance per annum. The estimate considers the profit that would be demanded in the marketplace to service the portfolio of outstanding loans subject to the Company’s servicing agreements.
Prepayment rates
–Prepayment rates are the Company’s estimate of the cumulative principal prepayments that will occur over the entire life of a loan as a percentage of the original principal amount of the loan. The assumption regarding cumulative prepayments impacts the projected balances and expected terms of the loans, which are used to project future servicing revenues.
Significant Recurring Level 3 Fair Value Input Sensitivity 
The table below presents the fair value sensitivity of loan servicing assets to adverse changes in key assumptions. The fair value of loan servicing assets and liabilities is not sensitive to adverse changes in discount rates and prepayment rates as such changes do not result in a material impact on the fair value as of December 31, 2023 and 2024. Adverse changes in market-servicing rates do not result in a material impact to the fair value of loan servicing liabilities as of December 31, 2023 and 2024.

Beneficial Interests
In connection with the committed capital and other co-investment arrangements that meet a definition of derivatives (derivative beneficial interests), the Company is obligated to make payments to the third-party or is entitled to receive payments from the third-party if credit performance on the underlying loans deviates from initial expectations set at the time of loan sale or origination, subject to a dollar cap. In the arrangements that are associated with debt-like securities with embedded derivative features, the Company makes an initial investment and is entitled to a portion of cash flows from repayments received over time on the underlying loan portfolios. These cash flows vary depending on the demonstrated credit performance relative to our expectations.
As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, the fair value of the beneficial interest assets related to these arrangements was $
41.0
 million and $
176.8
 million, respectively. As of the same dates, the fair value of the beneficial interest liabilities was $
4.2
 million and $
10.1
 million, respectively.
Valuation Methodology 
Beneficial interests are measured at estimated fair value using a discounted cash flow model. This discounted cash flow model sets expectations for cash flows to be received by the Company under each arrangement based on contractually-defined terms, such as total return, portfolio composition, frequency of cash distribution, and others and calculates net cash flows to be received by the Company. These net cash flows are then discounted using an estimate of market rates of return that reflect the risk premium related to those cash flows. As credit performance is demonstrated by the underlying loan portfolios, each discounted cash flow model is periodically updated to determine future cash inflows and outflows based on the latest estimated performance for the duration of each arrangement. The discounted cash flow model uses inputs discussed below that are inherently judgmental and reflect the Company’s best estimates of the assumptions a market participant would use to determine fair value of our beneficial interests.

Discount rates
–The discount rates are rates of return used to discount future expected cash flows to arrive at a present value, which represents the fair value. The discount rates used for the projected net cash flows are the Company’s estimates of the rates of return that market participants would require when investing in these financial instruments with cash flows dependent on credit performance of the underlying loan portfolio. A risk premium component is implicitly included in the discount rates to reflect the amount of compensation market participants require due to the uncertainty inherent in the instruments’ cash flows resulting from risks such as credit and liquidity. The Company uses two different discount rates for expected cash flows associated with demonstrated to-date credit performance and those associated with future credit performance. The difference in these rates reflects the level of uncertainty and, as a result, risk premium that would be required by market participants when investing in these instruments. 
Credit risk rate spreads
–Credit risk rate spreads are the measurement of estimated credit performance of underlying loan portfolios as of the reporting date in comparison to the Company’s estimates at the time of origination or sale of loans under these arrangements (“initial expectation”). More specifically, credit risk rate spreads are the Company’s estimated difference between the initial expectation of the cumulative principal of a loan portfolio, net of average recoveries, that is estimated not be repaid over the life of a beneficial interest (“cumulative net loss”) and the same estimate as of the reporting date. A positive credit risk rate spread indicates that the currently estimated cumulative net loss is higher than initially estimated for a particular portfolio. A negative credit risk rate spread indicates the opposite – the currently estimated cumulative net loss is lower than the initial expectation. Credit risk rate spreads are expressed as a percentage of the initial expectation of the cumulative total net losses. The difference between initially expected and currently estimated cumulative net losses impacts the amount and the timing of cash flows the Company expects to receive on beneficial interest assets or to pay for  beneficial interest liabilities.
The following table presents the sensitivity of beneficial interest assets and liabilities to adverse changes in key assumptions used in the valuation model as of December 31, 2023 and 2024. Adverse changes in discount rates do not result in a material impact to the fair value of beneficial interest liabilities as of December 31, 2023 and 2024.

Valuation Methodology
The discounted cash flow methodology, which is used to estimate the fair value of trailing fee liabilities, uses the same projected net cash flows as the underlying loans. The fair valuation methodology considers projected prepayments and historical defaults, losses and recoveries to project future losses and net cash flows of the underlying loans. Net cash flows are discounted using an estimate of market rates of return.

The interest rates on our warehouse credit facilities are floating and designed as a reference rate plus a spread. Reference rates include the Compounded Secured Overnight Financing Rate, weighted-average cost of commercial paper notes issued by the lender, and the federal funds rate. The stated interest rate excludes unused commitment fees which range from 
0.5
% to 
1.0
%. The undrawn fee for Upstart Small Dollar Loan Trust is the dollar amount of interest and fees that would have been due if the daily average aggregate outstanding principal balance was equal to 
75
% of the then-applicable borrowing base.
(2)
The first date represents the final date the Company may borrow up to the maximum capacity under the warehouse. The second date is the maturity date, when the outstanding principal amount, together with accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable in full.
(3)
Total capacity is as of December 31, 2024. All amounts are committed, except for Upstart High Yield Loan Trust of $
150.0

Upstart Small Dollar Loan Trust of $
100.0
 million and Upstart Loan Trust for which $
150.0
 million of the $
325.0

December 31, 2024
, the Upstart Auto Warehouse Trust facility is in the amortization period and can no longer be drawn on. 
(4)
Represents the aggregate restricted cash and unpaid principal balance of loans pledged as collateral.
On April 24, 2024, Upstart Loan Trust entered into an amendment to the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit and Security Agreement, which increased the uncommitted portion of the total borrowing capacity to purchase unsecured personal loans from $
75.0
 million to $
150.0
 million. All other key terms of the agreement remain the same. 
On June 7, 2024, Upstart Auto Warehouse Trust amended its credit agreement to extend the maturity date to December 15, 2025. The amortization period began on June 14, 2024 and accordingly, Upstart Auto Warehouse Trust may no longer draw on the facility and all collections that represent repayment of loans pledged as collateral under the facility are applied to reduce the outstanding balance. 
On June 28, 2024, Upstart Auto Warehouse Trust 2 entered into a warehouse credit facility for auto loans, and Upstart Small Dollar Loan Trust entered into a warehouse credit facility for small dollar loans. On December

27, 2024, Upstart High Yield Loan Trust entered into a warehouse credit facility for unsecured personal loans. These warehouse credit facilities are secured by a lien and security interest in the auto, small dollar, or unsecured personal loans, as applicable, the purchases of which are financed by the borrowings. Each of Upstart Auto Warehouse Trust 2, Upstart Small Dollar Loan Trust, and Upstart High Yield Loan Trust may borrow up to the capacity until the facility termination date, and must pay all outstanding amounts by the maturity date, under its respective warehouse credit facility. 
The warehouse credit facilities contain certain financial covenants. As of December 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants for each of its warehouse credit facilities. 
Convertible Senior Notes
In August 2021, the Company issued $
661.3
 million in aggregate principal amount of 
0.25
% convertible senior notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”). In September 2024, the Company issued $
431.3
 million in aggregate principal amount of 
2.00
% convertible senior notes due 2029 (the “2029 Notes”). In November 2024, the Company issued $
500.0
 million in aggregate principal amount of 
1.00
% convertible senior notes due 2030 (the “2030 Notes” , together with the “2029 Notes” and 2026 Notes, the “Notes”). Concurrently with the issuance of the 2029 Notes, the Company used approximately $
302.4
 million
 of the 
proceeds to repurchase approximately $
334.2
 million in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 2026 Notes in individually negotiated transactions. The Company additionally repurchased approximately $
27.9
 million of the outstanding 2026 Notes during the third quarter of 2024 through open market purchases. 
The table below presents the activity of the Notes during the year ended December 31, 2024:

The repurchases of the 2026 Notes were accounted for as a debt extinguishment. The difference between the consideration paid to repurchase the 2026 Notes and the carrying value of the 2026 Notes, resulted in a gain on debt extinguishment of $
33.4
 million
 separately reported 
on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss during the year ended December 31, 2024. The partial extinguishment did not result in any changes to the terms of the 2026 Notes.
Each series of Notes is governed by its respective indenture (each, an “Indenture”), and represents
 senior unsecured obligations of the Company. The 
2026 Notes
 mature on August 15, 2026, the 
2029 Notes mature on
 October 1, 2029, and the 
2030 Notes mature on November 15, 2030 
unless such Notes are earlier converted, redeemed, or repurchased in accordance with their terms
. The Company may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes, at its option, on or after August 20, 2024, in the case of the 2026 Notes, on or after 
October 6, 2027, in the case of the 
2029 Notes, and on or after November 20, 2027, in the case of the 2030 Notes, if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock has been at least 
130
% of the conversion price for the Notes of the applicable series then in effect for at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 
30
 consecutive trading-day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides a notice of redemption for the Notes of such series at a redemption price equal to

Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, either cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at its election.
The conversion price for each series of Notes will be subject to adjustment if certain events occur. In addition, following certain corporate events that may occur prior to the applicable maturity date or following the Company’s issuance of a notice of redemption for a series of Notes, the Company may be required to increase the conversion rate for the holder of the Notes of such series who elect to convert such Notes in connection with such corporate event or during the related redemption period in certain circumstances. Additionally, upon the occurrence of a corporate event that constitutes a “fundamental change” pursuant to the applicable Indenture, holders of the applicable series of Notes may require the Company to repurchase for cash all or a portion of such Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes of such series to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.

Capped Call Transactions
In connection with the issuance of the 2026 Notes and the 2029 Notes, the Company entered into separate privately negotiated capped call instruments with certain financial institutions (the “2026 Capped Calls,” with respect to the 2026 Notes and the “2029 Capped Calls,” with respect to the 2029 Notes, and the 2026 Capped Calls together with the 2029 Capped Calls, the “Capped Calls”). 
The Capped Calls are generally expected to offset the potential dilution to the Company’s common stock upon any conversion of Notes and/or reduce any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be, in the event the market price per share of the Company’s common stock, as measured under the terms of the Capped Calls, is greater than the strike price of the Capped Calls, with such offset and/or reduction subject to a cap. If, however, the market price per share of the common stock, as measured under the terms of the Capped Calls, exceeds the cap price of the Capped Calls, there would be dilution and/or there would not be a reduction of such potential cash payments, in each case, to the extent that such market price per share of the Company’s common stock exceeds the cap price of the Capped Calls.

The Capped Calls were determined to be freestanding financial instruments that meet the criteria for classification in equity; as such the Capped Calls were recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital within stockholders’ equity.
In the third quarter of 2024, in connection with the partial repurchase of the 2026 Notes described above, the Company entered into agreements to terminate the portion of the 2026 Capped Calls corresponding to the principal amount of the 2026 Notes repurchased. As a result of the partial terminations of the 2026 Capped Calls, the Company received immaterial
 ca
sh payments which were recorded as an increase of additional paid-in capital within stockholders’ equity.

Interest Rate Cap Arrangements 
In February 2023 and June 2023, Upstart Auto Warehouse Trust and Upstart Loan Trust entered into interest rate cap agreements with a strike rate of 
3.0
% and 
3.25
%, respectively. The agreements were entered into in relation to the warehouse credit facilities which bear floating interest rates, refer to 
“Note 8.  Borrowings”
 for further information. The interest rate caps provide protection to the credit facilities against exposure to changes in cash flows to the extent the underlying interest rate on the facility exceeds the strike rate. The Upstart Auto Warehouse Trust interest rate cap matures in April 2029 and the Upstart Loan Trust interest rate cap matures in June 2025. The interest rate cap agreements meet the definition of a derivative and are reported at fair value. Refer to “
Note 5.  Fair Value Measurement
” for additional information.

Share Repurchase Program 
In February 2022, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase up to $
400.0
 million of common stock of the Company. The Company may repurchase shares from time to time through open market purchases, in privately negotiated transactions or by other means, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of its common stock, and may be suspended or terminated by the Company at any time at its discretion without prior notice. 
The Company records share repurchases on the settlement date. Repurchased shares are subsequently retired and returned to the status of authorized but unissued. The Company’s policy for share retirements is to allocate the excess between par value and the repurchase price, including costs and fees, to additional paid-in capital. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company made 
no
 repurchases of common stock. As of December 31, 2024, $
222.1
 million remains available for future purchases of our common stock under the share repurchase program. 
Equity Incentive Plans
In 2012, the Company adopted the Equity Incentive Plan (“2012 Equity Incentive Plan”) authorizing the granting of incentive stock options (“ISOs”) and non-statutory stock options (“NSOs”) to eligible participants.
Under the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan, the exercise price of an ISO and NSO shall not be less than 
100
% of the estimated fair value of the shares on the date of grant, as determined by the Board of Directors. The exercise price of an ISO granted to a 
10
% stockholder shall not be less than 
110
% of the estimated fair value of the shares on the date of grant, as determined by the Board of Directors. Options generally vest over 
four years
 and are exercisable for up to 
10
 years after the date of grant if the employee provides service to the Company for at least 
three years
. 
In October 2020, our Board of Directors adopted, and in November 2020 our Board of Directors amended and our stockholders approved, our 2020 Equity Incentive Plan which was effective on December 14, 2020. The Company terminated the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan immediately prior to effectiveness of the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan with respect to the grant of future awards. However, our 2012 Equity Incentive Plan continues to govern the terms and conditions of the outstanding awards granted under our 2012 Equity Incentive Plan.

The 2020 Equity Incentive Plan authorizes granting of ISOs, NSOs, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance awards. In addition, the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan also includes any shares subject to awards granted under our 2012 Equity Incentive Plan that, on or after December 15, 2020, expire or otherwise terminate without having been exercised or issued in full, are tendered to or withheld by us for payment of an exercise price or for satisfying tax withholding obligations, or are forfeited to or repurchased by us due to failure to vest. The maximum number of shares that may be added to the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan pursuant to outstanding awards under the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan is 
15,000,000
 shares. The number of shares available for issuance under our 2020 Equity Incentive Plan also includes an annual increase on the first day of each fiscal year beginning with 2021 in an amount equal to the lesser of 
15,000,000
 shares or 
5
% of the outstanding shares of our common stock on the last day of our immediately preceding fiscal year.

Performance-based Restricted Stock Units
On February 24, 2023, the Company’s Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved the cancellation of PRSUs that may be settled for 
687,500
 shares of the Company’s common stock granted to an executive in February 2022.
At the time the PRSUs were granted, the PRSUs were intended to be the executive’s primary compensation through calendar year 2029 so that, in connection with the grant of the PRSUs, the executive’s cash compensation was limited to the amount necessary to allow the executive to participate in the broad-based employee benefits generally applicable at the Company. In reaching its decision to cancel the PRSUs, the Compensation Committee extensively considered the purpose of the PRSUs and determined that the grant no longer provided the intended retention and incentive value to the executive. After considering various alternatives and the pros and cons of such alternatives and consulting with its external advisors, the Compensation Committee believed it was in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders to cancel the PRSUs in exchange for the reinstatement of the executive’s cash compensation, including the executive’s annual base salary and eligibility to participate in the Company’s 2023 Executive Bonus Plan with an annual target bonus opportunity equal to 
75
% of the executive’s annual base salary.
Compensation expense associated with the PRSUs was recognized using the straight-line attribution method for each of the 
nine
 vesting tranches over the respective derived service period. The weighted-average grant date fair value using the Monte Carlo simulation was $
68.76
 per share. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense for awards subject to market-based vesting conditions regardless of whether these conditions will be achieved or not, and stock-based compensation expense for any such awards is not reversed if the market condition is not met. The cancellation of the grant was treated by the Company as a settlement for no consideration and remaining unrecognized compensation expense of $
39.0
 million associated with the grant was accelerated and recorded by the Company as part of engineering and product development expense on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss during the year ended December 31, 2023. 
There were 
no
 PRSUs outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2024.

2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Our ESPP provides for consecutive 
six-month
 offering periods. The offering periods are scheduled to start on the first trading day on or after February 15 and August 15 of each year. The ESPP permits participants to purchase shares in the amount of 
85
% of the lower of the fair market value of our shares of common stock on the first trading day of the offering period or on the exercise date. During the year ended December 31, 2024
, 
333,564
 shares of c
ommon stock were purchased under the ESPP.
As of December 31, 2024, total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to the ESPP was 
immaterial
.
Fair Value of Awards Granted
In determining the fair value of stock-based awards, the Company uses a Black-Scholes option-pricing model for its options granted and ESPP purchase rights. The inputs used for estimating the fair values of options and ESPP purchase rights granted during the period include: 
Fair Value of Common Stock
–The fair value of the Company’s common stock is determined by the closing price, on the date of grant, of its common stock, which is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. 
Expected Term
–The expected term represents the period that the Company’s stock options and ESPP purchase rights are expected to be outstanding. We estimate the expected term based on the simplified method, which is the weighted-average time to vesting and the contractual maturity.
Volatility
–Because the Company has not had an active trading market for its common stock for a sufficient period of time, the expected volatility is estimated based on the average volatility for comparable publicly-traded companies, over a period equal to the expected term of the stock option grants.
Risk-free Interest Rate
–The risk-free interest rate assumption is based on the U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of the option. 
Dividends
–The Company has never paid dividends on its common stock and does not anticipate paying dividends on common stock for the foreseeable future. Therefore, the Company uses an expected dividend yield of 
zero
.

(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted)
The Company has commitments to fund future advances on HELOCs. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, these commitments were 
immaterial
 and $
7.6
 million, respectively, however, since these commitments could expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. 
Contingencies
Accounting for contingencies requires the Company to use judgment related to both the likelihood of a loss and the estimate of the amount or range of loss. The Company records a loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company discloses material contingencies when it believes a loss is not probable but reasonably possible and may voluntarily provide information on additional contingencies.
From time to time the Company is subject to, and it is presently involved in, various litigation and legal proceedings arising from the ordinary course of business activities, the outcome of which the Company cannot reasonably determine. Other than the class actions and derivative actions described below, the Company does not believe that it is presently a party to any litigation of which the outcome would individually, or taken together, have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows, or financial condition. As of December 31, 2023, no loss contingency was recorded in connection with legal proceedings. As of December 31, 2024, an immaterial loss contingency was recorded in connection with legal proceedings. 
Indemnifications 
In the ordinary course of business, the Company may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to vendors, directors, officers and other parties with respect to certain matters. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with directors and certain officers and employees that will require the Company, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors, officers or employees. No demands have been made upon the Company to provide indemnification under such agreements, and thus, there are no claims that the Company is aware of that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Repurchases 
Under the terms of the loan purchase and loan servicing agreements between the Company and institutional investors, as well as in agreements with investors in securitizations and pass-through certificate transactions, the Company may, in certain circumstances, become obligated to repurchase loans from such institutional investors. Generally, these circumstances include the occurrence of verifiable identity theft, the failure of sold loans to meet the terms of certain loan-level representations and warranties that speak as of the time of origination or sale, the failure to comply with other contractual terms with the institutional investors, or a violation of the applicable federal, state, or local lending laws.
The maximum potential amount of future payments associated under this obligation is the outstanding balances of the loans sold to the institutional investors, which at December 31, 2023 and 2024 was $
12,208.1
 million and $
11,237.2
 million, respectively. Actual payments made relating to the Company’s repurchase and indemnification obligations were 
immaterial
 and $
6.0
 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively. 
The Company did not have material contingent liabilities related to future loan repurchase obligations as of December 31, 2023 and 2024. These amounts are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

Legal
On July 26, 2022, a lawsuit was filed in United States District Court, Southern District of Ohio, captioned Crain v. Upstart Holdings, Inc. et al., Case No. 2:22-cv-02935-ALM-EPD (S.D. Ohio) against the Company, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Financial Officer, alleging that the defendants made false and/or misleading statements or omissions about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, as well as Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The Crain lawsuit claims unspecified damages and legal fees. On August 16, 2022, the court appointed a lead plaintiff and approved lead counsel in the Crain action. On December 5, 2022, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended complaint, which names the same defendants as the previous complaint, along with two Company executives, as well as Third Point LLC and its CEO and Third Point Ventures LLC and its managing partner (also a former Upstart board member). The consolidated amended complaint brings the same claims as the previous complaint but adds a claim under Section 20A of the Exchange Act. On February 24, 2023, the Upstart defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint. On September 29, 2023, the Court issued an order, granting in part and denying in part the Upstart defendants’ motion. On November 7, 2023, the Upstart defendants filed a motion for reconsideration, which the Court denied on August 5, 2024. On February 2, 2024, Lead Plaintiff, Universal-Investment-Gesellschaft mbH, and plaintiffs, Kathy Brooks and Kevin Crain, filed a motion for an order to certify this matter, now captioned In re Upstart Holdings Securities Litigation, as a class action, appoint themselves as class representatives, and approve their selection of Motley Rice LLC and Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP as co-class counsel. On November 21, 2024, the Upstart defendants filed an opposition to plaintiffs’ class certification motion, and on December 10, 2024 plaintiffs filed a reply in support thereof.  No hearing has been set on the motion.  On December 6, 2024, plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file a first amended complaint.  On January 21, 2025, Third Point Ventures LLC, Third Point LLC, and its CEO filed a motion to intervene for the limited purpose of opposing plaintiffs’ motion for leave to file a first amended complaint, and on February 18, 2025 plaintiffs may file a reply in support thereof.  No hearing has been set on the motion. The Company believes the remaining claims in the action are without merit and intends to defend itself vigorously. 
On July 28, 2022, a derivative lawsuit was filed in United States District Court, Southern District of Ohio, captioned OConnor v. Huber et al., Case No. 2:22-cv-02961-EAS-KAJ (S.D. Ohio). The OConnor action includes allegations similar to those in the Crain complaint, and names as defendants each of the Company’s current board members and its Chief Financial Officer. The Company is named as a nominal defendant. The OConnor action includes claims for violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and waste of corporate assets. The OConnor action seeks unspecified monetary damages and an accounting from the individual defendants. The OConnor action also seeks unspecified corporate governance and internal procedure modifications, punitive damages, and legal fees.
On October 7, 2022, a second derivative lawsuit was filed in United States District Court, Southern District of Ohio, captioned Chung v. Huber et al., No. 2:22-cv-03620-MHW-CMV (S.D. Ohio). The Chung action includes allegations similar to those in the OConnor complaint, and names as defendants each of the Company’s current board members, a former board member, and its Chief Financial Officer. The Company is named as a nominal defendant. The Chung action includes claims for violation of Section 10(b), 14(a), and 21D of the Exchange Act, breach of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, and waste of corporate assets. The Chung action seeks unspecified monetary damages, restitution, and attorney’s fees and costs from the individual defendants. It also seeks corporate governance and internal procedure modifications.
On December 12, 2022, in response to a joint motion by the parties, the Court consolidated the OConnor and Chung matters, appointed co-lead counsel, and stayed the consolidated case until resolution of the related securities class action. On April 24, 2024, the plaintiffs in the consolidated action filed an amended complaint. The amended complaint includes allegations similar to those in the initial complaint in the OConnor action, and names the same defendants as the initial complaint, along with an additional Company executive and another former board

member. The amended complaint brings the same claims as the initial complaint in the OConnor action but adds claims under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, for contribution under Sections 10(b) and 21D of the Exchange Act, and for abuse of control and gross mismanagement. The amended complaint seeks similar relief to that sought in the initial complaint in the OConnor action.
On February 3, 2023, a third derivative lawsuit was filed, in the United States District Court, District of Delaware, captioned Hsu v. Girouard, et al., 1:23-cv-00132-UNA (D. Del.).

Following the issuance of the September 29, 2023 order on the motion to dismiss in the related securities class action, on November 16, 2023, in response to a joint stipulation and proposed order submitted by the parties, the Court stayed the Okhai action until resolution of the motion for reconsideration of the September 29, 2023 order on the motion to dismiss in the related securities class action. Following denial of the motion for reconsideration in the related securities class action, the parties in the Okhai action finished briefing and argued the defendants’ motion to continue the stay. On October 24, 2024, the Court continued the stay until February 1, 2025.

proposed order submitted by the parties, the Court stayed the Romanyshyn action pending the outcome of the motion to stay in the related Okhai derivative action (which stay will be briefed, consistent with the above).

Given the uncertainty of litigation described above, the preliminary stage of the cases, and the legal standards that must be met for, among other things, class certification and success on the merits, the Company cannot estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that may result from these actions. 
On November 17, 2023, we received a subpoena from the SEC seeking various documents and information regarding our disclosures, including the use of our AI models and loans, among other things. We are cooperating with the SEC and are unable to predict the outcome of this matter.

Management believes that, based on available evidence, both positive and negative, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be utilized, and as such the Company maintains a full valuation allowance at December 31, 2024. The valuation allowance increased by $
65.8
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 primarily as a result of current year activities and the capitalization of research and experimental expenditures.
176
Table of Contents
Upstart Holdings, Inc. 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted)
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately $
1,117.1
 million and $
1,670.6
 million of federal and state (post-apportioned) net operating losses (NOL), that will begin to expire in 2035 and 2034, respectively. The Company also has Federal and California research and development tax credits of approximately $
61.5
 million and $
24.4
 million, respectively. The Federal research credits will begin to expire in 2032 and the California research credits have no expiration date. The Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) limits the amount of NOL carryforwards that a company may use in a given year in the event of certain cumulative changes in ownership over a three-year period as described in Section 382 of the IRC. Utilization of NOL carryforwards and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization. The Company performed an ownership analysis and identified ownership changes in prior years, as defined under IRC Section 382 and 383, however neither resulted in a material limitation that will reduce the total amount of NOL carryforwards and credits that can be utilized.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

If recognized, all of the unrecognized tax benefits would not impact the effective tax rate due to the valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $
26.5
 million unrecognized income tax benefits and there was increases of $
4.3
 million to the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits during the year. The Company does not anticipate any significant increases or decreases to unrecognized tax benefit during the next twelve months. The Company’s policy is to classify interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. The Company had no interest or penalty accruals associated with uncertain tax benefits in its consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the tax year ended December 31, 2024.
The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. Federal jurisdiction and various state and local jurisdictions. The Company is not currently under examination by income tax authorities in federal, state, or local jurisdictions. However, because the Company has net operating losses and credits carried forward in several jurisdictions, certain items attributable to closed tax years are still subject to adjustment by applicable taxing authorities through an adjustment to tax attributes carried forward to open years. All tax returns will remain open for examination by the federal and most state taxing authorities for three years and four years, respectively, from the date of utilization of any net operating loss carryforwards or research and development credits.

Net Loss Per Share
Basic net loss per common share is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant year. Diluted net loss per share is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant year, adjusted for the dilutive effect of share-based awards and convertible debt.
For years in which the Company reports net losses, basic and diluted net loss per share are the same because potentially dilutive common shares are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive.

Segment Information
The Company’s organization and management structure is designed to support development of different lending product offerings, which are grouped into 
three
 operating segments - Personal Lending (unsecured personal loans and small dollar loans), Auto Lending (auto refinance and auto retail loans), and Other (HELOCs and other). These operating segments are separately managed and evaluated by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”), the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, who allocates resources and assesses performance at this level. The Company has determined that only 
one
 operating segment, Personal Lending, meets the definition of a reportable segment.
The Company generates all its revenue in the U.S. and a majority is earned in exchange for the use of the Company’s platform and for borrower referrals as well as for loan servicing activities provided to its lending partners and institutional investors. Refer to 
Note 2.  Revenue
 for further information related to the Company's disaggregation of revenue from fees by type of service.
Contribution Profit is the primary measure of segment profit and loss reviewed by the CODM to assess business performance and strategy, prepare the Company’s annual operating budget and financial forecasts, and communicate with the Company’s Board of Directors concerning the Company’s financial performance. To derive Contribution Profit, the Company subtracts the sum of borrower acquisition costs as well as borrower verification and servicing costs from revenue from fees, net.
The following table presents financial information, including Contribution Profit, for the Company’s Personal Lending segment

None.
ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation and supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were designed and function effectively to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on its evaluation under the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Deloitte & Touche LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, and their report is included below. 
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will 
182
Table of Contents
succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Upstart Holdings, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Upstart Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 13, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion 
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
183
Table of Contents
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
