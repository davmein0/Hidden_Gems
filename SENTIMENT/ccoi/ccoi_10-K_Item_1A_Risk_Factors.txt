Item 1A. Risk Factors
”
 and “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.
”
 Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to:
Our acquisition of Sprint Communications (as defined below), including difficulties integrating our business with the Sprint Business, which may result in the combined company not operating as effectively and efficiently as expected; transition services required to support the Sprint Business and the related costs continuing for a period longer than expected, the COVID-19 pandemic and accompanying government policies worldwide; vaccination and in-office requirements, delays in the delivery of network equipment or optical fiber, loss of key right-of-way agreements, future economic instability in the global economy, including the risk of economic recession and recent bank failures and liquidity concerns at certain other banks, which could affect spending on Internet services; the impact of changing foreign exchange rates (in particular the Euro to US dollar and Canadian dollar to US dollar exchange rates) on the translation of our non-US dollar denominated revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities into US dollars; legal and operational difficulties in new markets; the imposition of a requirement that we contribute to the US Universal Service Fund on the basis of our Internet revenue; changes in government policy and/or regulation, including rules regarding data protection, cyber security and net neutrality; increasing competition leading to lower prices for our services; our ability to attract new customers and to increase and maintain the volume of traffic on our network; the ability to maintain our Internet peering and right-of-way arrangements on favorable terms; our ability to renew our long-term leases of optical fiber and right-of-way agreements that comprise our network; our reliance on a limited number of equipment vendors, and the potential for hardware or software problems associated with such equipment; tariffs imposed on equipment we purchase for our network; the dependence of our network on the quality and dependability of third-party fiber and right-of-way providers; our ability to retain certain customers that comprise a significant portion of our revenue base; the management of network failures and/or disruptions; our ability to make payments on our indebtedness as they become due and outcomes in litigation, risks associated with variable interest rates under our Swap Agreement as well as other risks discussed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, without limitation, this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.
Acquisition of Sprint Communications
On May 1, 2023 (the “Closing Date”), Cogent Infrastructure, Inc. (now Cogent Infrastructure, LLC), a Delaware corporation and our direct wholly owned subsidiary (the “Buyer” or “Cogent Infrastructure”), closed on its acquisition of the U.S. long-haul fiber network (including the non-U.S. extensions thereof) of Sprint Communications and its subsidiaries (the “Sprint Business”) in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), dated September 6, 2022, by and among us, Sprint Communications LLC, a Kansas limited liability company (“Sprint Communications”) and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of T-Mobile US, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“T-Mobile”), and Sprint LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of T-Mobile (the “Seller”). On the Closing Date, we purchased from the Seller all of the issued and outstanding membership interests (the “Purchased Interests”) of Wireline Network Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company that, following an internal restructuring and divisive merger, held Sprint Communications’ assets and liabilities relating to the Sprint Business (such transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, collectively, the “Transaction”).
Purchase Price
On the Closing Date, we consummated the Transaction pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, providing a purchase price of $1 payable to the Seller for the Purchased Interests, subject to customary adjustments, including working capital (the “Working Capital Adjustment”), as set forth in the Purchase Agreement. As consideration for the Purchased Interests, the Working Capital Adjustment (primarily related to acquired cash and cash equivalents of an estimated $43.4 million at the Closing Date in order to fund the international operations of the Sprint Business) resulted in us making a payment to the Seller of $61.1 million on the Closing Date. In April 2024, an additional Working Capital Adjustment of $5.0 million was paid to the Seller.

Short-term Lease Payment
The Purchase Agreement provides for a payment of $28.1 million ($19.8 million net of discount) from the Seller to us related to acquired short - term operating lease obligations (the “Short - term Lease Payment”). The Short - term Lease Payment will be paid from the Seller to us in four equal payments in months 55 to 58 after the Closing Date. The final determination of the Short - term Lease Payment was completed in April 2024. The Short - term Lease Payment was recorded at its present value resulting in a discount of $8.4 million. The interest rate used in determining the present value was derived considering rates on similar issued debt instruments with comparable durations, among other market factors. The determination of the discount rate requires some judgment. During the third quarter of 2023, the Short - term Lease Payment was reduced by $4.8 million and in the first quarter of 2024 the Short - term Lease Payment, net of discount, was reduced by an additional $17.0 million.
IP Transit Services Agreement
On the Closing Date, we entered into an agreement for IP transit services (“IP Transit Services Agreement”), pursuant to which TMUSA will pay us an aggregate of $700.0 million, consisting of (i) $350.0 million in equal monthly installments of $29.2 million per month during the first year after the Closing Date and (ii) $350.0 million in equal monthly installments of $8.3 million per month over the subsequent 42 months. Under the IP Transit Services Agreement., TMUSA paid us $204.2 million and $204.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
We accounted for the Transaction as a business combination under ASC Topic 805 
Business Combinations
 (“ASC 805”). We evaluated what elements are part of the business combination and the consideration exchanged to complete the acquisition. Under ASC 805, we concluded that the $700.0 million of payments to be made represent consideration received from T-Mobile to complete the acquisition of a distressed business. We also evaluated whether the IP Transit Services Agreement was in the scope of ASU No. 2014-09 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 (“ASC 606”). We concluded that T-Mobile did not represent a “customer” as defined by ASC 606, the stated contract price did not represent consideration for services to be delivered, and the transaction did not satisfy the definition of revenue, which excluded this arrangement from the scope of ASC 606. As a result, and considering statements made by T-Mobile, the IP Transit Services Agreement was recorded in connection with the Transaction at its discounted present value resulting in a discount of $79.6 million. The interest rate used in determining the present value was derived considering rates on similar issued debt instruments with comparable durations, amongst other market factors. The determination of the discount rate requires some judgment.
Transition Services Agreement
On the Closing Date, the Buyer entered into a transition services agreement (the “TSA”) with the Seller, pursuant to which the Seller provides to the Buyer, and the Buyer provides to the Seller on an interim basis following the Closing Date, certain specified services (the “Transition Services”) to ensure an orderly transition following the separation of the Sprint Business from Sprint Communications. The services provided by the Seller to the Buyer include, among others, information technology support, back office and finance, real estate and facilities, vendor and supply chain management, including the payment and processing of vendor invoices for the Company and human resources. The services provided by the Buyer to the Seller include, among others, information technology and network support, finance and back office and other wireless business support.
The Transition Services are generally intended to be provided for a period of up to two years following the Closing Date, although such period may be extended for an additional one-year term by either party upon 30 days’ prior written notice. The fees for the Transition Services are calculated using either a per service monthly fee or an hourly rate for the employees allocated to provide such services. Any third-party costs incurred in providing the Transition Services are passed on to the party receiving such services at cost for the two-year period. Amounts paid for the Sprint Business by T-Mobile are reimbursed at cost.
Either party to the TSA may terminate the agreement with respect to any individual service in full for convenience upon 30 days’ prior written notice for certain services and reduced for other services after a 90-day period. The TSA may be terminated in its entirety if the other party has failed to perform any of its material obligations and such failure is not cured within 30 days. The TSA provides for customary indemnification and limits on liability. Amounts billed under the TSA are due 30 days from receipt of the related invoice. Amounts billed to us under the TSA are primarily for reimbursement at cost of payments to vendors of the Sprint Business until these vendors are fully transitioned to us.

During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we were billed $27.2 million and $284.1 million, respectively, as due to the Seller under the TSA. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we paid to the Seller $93.8 million and $217.2 million, respectively, under the TSA. Amounts billed under the TSA are due 30 days from receipt of the related invoice. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we owed $0.5 million and $66.9 million, respectively, to the Seller under the TSA. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we billed the Seller $1.1 million and $6.2 million, respectively, as due from the Seller under the TSA. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Seller paid us $1.3 million and $6.0 million, respectively, under the TSA. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Seller owed us $0.1 million and $4.5 million, respectively, under the TSA.
Severance reimbursement
The Purchase Agreement also provides for reimbursement from the Seller to the Buyer for qualifying severance expenses incurred. Total qualifying severance expenses were $28.6 million of which $12.3 million and $16.2 million were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and fully reimbursed by the Seller.
Acquisition-Related Costs
In connection with the Transaction and negotiation of the Purchase Agreement, we incurred a total of $13.6 million of professional fees and other acquisition related costs (not including severance costs). Acquisition related costs (not including severance costs) were $9.1 million, $2.3 million and $2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
Other Services Provided to the Seller
In addition, on the Closing Date, we entered into a commercial agreement (the “CSA”) with TMUSA for colocation and connectivity services, pursuant to which we provide such services to TMUSA for a per service monthly fee plus certain third-party costs incurred in providing the services. Under the CSA, we recorded service revenue of $14.7 million and $23.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Service Revenue
. We continually work to grow our total service revenue by increasing the number of potential customers that we can reach on our network. We do this by investing capital to expand the geographic footprint of our network, increasing the number of buildings that we are connected to, including CNDCs and MTOBs, and increasing our penetration rate into our existing buildings. These efforts broaden the global reach of our network and increase the size of our potential addressable market. We also seek to grow our service revenue by investing in our sales and marketing team. We typically sell corporate connections at similar pricing to our competitors, but our customers benefit from our significantly faster speeds, greater aggregate throughput, enhanced service level agreements and rapid installation times. In the net-centric market, we offer comparable services in terms of capacity but typically at significantly lower prices.
Our service revenue increased by 10.1% from the year ended December 31, 2023 to the year ended December 31, 2024. Exchange rates negatively impacted our service revenue by $0.3 million. All foreign currency comparisons herein reflect results for the year ended December 31, 2024 translated at the average foreign currency exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our total service revenue increased primarily due to the revenue acquired in May 2023 with the Sprint Business and the growth in customers from expanding our network, adding additional buildings to our network, increasing our penetration into the buildings connected to our network and gaining market share by offering our services at lower prices than our competitors. These increases were partially offset by the cancellation of low margin and non-core customers we acquired with the Sprint Business, and a reduction in revenue under our CSA agreement with TMUSA.
Revenue recognition standards include guidance relating to any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer and may include, but is not limited to, gross receipts taxes, Universal Service Fund fees and certain state regulatory fees. We record these taxes billed to our customers on a gross basis (as service revenue and network operations expense) in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The impact of these taxes including the Universal Service Fund resulted in an increase to our revenues of $30.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2023 to the year ended December 31, 2024.

Revenue and customer connections by customer type
. Our corporate customers generally purchase their services on a price per connection basis. Our net-centric customers generally purchase their services on a price per megabit-metered basis. Our enterprise customers generally purchase our services on a price per location basis. We began to serve enterprise customers in connection with our acquisition of the Sprint Business. We define “enterprise” customers as large corporations (typically, Fortune 500 companies with greater than $5 billion in annual revenue) running Wide Area Networks (“WAN”) with several dozen to several hundred sites.
We believe that we are in a unique position to monetize the Sprint Business and its network and management expects to achieve significant cost reduction synergies and revenue synergies from the Transaction. Revenue and pre-tax loss for the Sprint Business included in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $283.3 million and $234.5 million, respectively.
On the Closing Date, we acquired 17,823 corporate customer connections, 5,711 net-centric customer connections and 23,209 enterprise customer connections with the Sprint Business. We classified the total $39.4 million of May 2023 Sprint Business monthly recurring revenue as $20.0 million of enterprise revenue, $12.9 million of corporate revenue and $6.5 million of net-centric revenue.
Revenues from our corporate, net-centric and enterprise customers represented 45.7%, 35.6% and 18.7% of total service revenue, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2024 and represented 47.2%, 36.5% and 16.3% of total service revenue, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2023.
Our revenue from our corporate customers increased primarily due to customers acquired with the Sprint Business. Our corporate customers take advantage of our superior speeds, greater aggregate throughput, service levels and installation times versus our competitors. The growing trend of customers installing second lines for redundancy in order to construct virtual private networks (“VPNs”) has also led to our ability to increase our corporate revenues. Beginning with and throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we witnessed a deteriorating real estate market in and around the buildings we service in central business districts in North America. Because of the rising vacancy levels and falling lease initiations or renewals, we experienced a slowdown in new sales to our corporate customers, which negatively affected our corporate revenue results. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we continued to see gradual declines in vacancy rates and rising office occupancy rates. As the option to fully or partially work from home becomes permanently established at many companies, our corporate customers are integrating some of the new applications that became part of the remote work environment, which benefits our corporate business as these customers upgrade their Internet access infrastructure to higher capacity connections. Further, if and when companies eventually return to the buildings in which we operate, we believe it will present an opportunity for increased sales. However, the exact timing and path of these positive trends remains uncertain.
Our revenue from our net-centric customers increased primarily due to growth in network traffic from our legacy net-centric customers and from net-centric customers acquired with the Sprint Business. Our net-centric customers purchase our services on a price per megabit basis. The net-centric market exhibits significant pricing pressure due to the continued introduction of new technology, which lowers the marginal cost of transmission and routing, and the commodity nature of the service where price is typically the only differentiating factor for these customers. Our average price per megabit of our installed base of customers decreased by 14.2% from the year ended December 31, 2023 to the year ended December 31, 2024. The impact of foreign exchange rates has a more significant impact on our net-centric revenues. Under our CSA with TMUSA, we recorded net-centric service revenue of $14.7 million and $23.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Our revenue from our enterprise customers increased primarily due to customers acquired with the Sprint Business.
Revenue and customer connections by network connection type.
 On the Closing Date, we classified the total $39.4 million of monthly Sprint Business revenue as $2.5 million of on-net revenue, $32.2 million of off-net revenue and $4.7 million of non-core revenue. Additionally, on the Closing Date, we classified the total 46,743 Sprint Business customer connections as 1,560 on-net customer connections, 24,667 off-net customer connections and 20,516 non-core customer connections.
Revenues from our on-net, off-net, wavelength and non-core customers represented 52.6%, 43.8%, 1.9% and 1.7% of total service revenue, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2024 and represented 54.5%, 41.8%, 0.6% and 3.1% of total service revenue, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2023.
Page 37 of 96

Table of Contents
Our on-net revenues increased from the year ended December 31, 2023 to the year ended December 31, 2024 primarily from customers acquired with the Sprint Business and an increase in revenues from our legacy Cogent customers. Under the CSA with TMUSA, we recorded on-net service revenue of $14.0 million and $21.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our off-net revenues increased from the year ended December 31, 2023 to the year ended December 31, 2024 primarily from customers acquired with the Sprint Business and an increase in revenues from our legacy Cogent customers.
In connection with our acquisition of the Sprint Business, we expanded our offerings of optical wavelength and optical transport services over our fiber network. Our wavelength revenue was $19.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and was $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
Our non-core revenues decreased from the year ended December 31, 2023 to the year ended December 31, 2024 primarily due to the cancellation of non-core revenues acquired in the Sprint Business. Non-core services are services, that we acquired and continue to support but do not actively sell.
Network Operations Expenses.
 Network operations expenses include the costs of personnel associated with service delivery, network management and customer support, network facilities costs, right-of-way fees, fiber and equipment maintenance fees, leased circuit costs, access and facilities fees paid to building owners and excise taxes billed to our customers and recorded on a gross basis. Non-cash equity-based compensation expense is included in network operations expenses consistent with the classification of the employee’s salaries and other compensation. Our 17.9% increase in network operations expense was primarily attributable to an increase in network operations expense from our acquisition of the Sprint Business and an increase in costs related to our network and facilities expansion activities.
Selling, General, and Administrative (“SG&A”) Expenses.
 Our SG&A expenses, including non-cash equity-based compensation expense, increased by 0.2% from the year ended December 31, 2023 to the year ended December 31, 2024. Non-cash equity-based compensation expense is included in SG&A expenses consistent with the classification of the employee’s salary and other compensation. SG&A expenses increased primarily from an increase in salaries and benefits from 942 employees added to our headcount from our acquisition of the Sprint Business on the Closing Date and costs associated with the Sprint acquisition including TSA costs. Our total headcount was 1,916 at December 31, 2024 and 1,947 at December 31, 2023.
Acquisition-Related Costs.
 In connection with the Transaction and negotiation of the Purchase Agreement, we incurred professional fees, and other acquisition related costs totaling $42.1 million, including $28.6 million of reimbursed severance costs. Such fees totaled $21.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and $18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.
Depreciation and Amortization Expenses.
 Our depreciation and amortization expense increased by 28.3% primarily due to the depreciation expense associated with assets acquired with the Sprint Business and an increase in deployed fixed assets, partly offset by the impact of an increase in the estimated useful life for our owned fiber acquired with the Sprint Business. Effective July 1, 2024, we changed our estimate of the useful life of our owned fiber to better reflect the estimated periods during which these assets will remain in service. The estimated useful life of the owned fiber that previously averaged 14 years was increased to an average of 40 years. The effect of this change in estimate on the year ended December 31, 2024 was to reduce depreciation expense by $8.7 million.
Gain on Lease Termination.
 In June 2024, we elected to exercise a contractual option to prepay in full at a 12.0% discounted rate an IRU finance lease agreement between us and a vendor we assumed with the Sprint Business for $114.6 million. At the payment date, the present value of the IRU finance lease liability was $117.9 million and the remaining thirty-one $4.2 million monthly principal payments totaled $130.2 million. The prepayment resulted in a gain on lease termination of $3.3 million related to the difference between the book value of $117.9 million and the cash payment of $114.6 million. We are continuing to use the related IRU asset.
Gain on Bargain Purchase.
 We accounted for our acquisition of the Sprint Business as a business combination. The identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair values as of the acquisition date. Assigning fair market values to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of an acquisition requires the use of significant judgment regarding estimates and assumptions. As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired was $1.9 billion (including amounts due under the IP Transit Services Agreement) and was in excess of the $0.9 billion liabilities assumed and the $0.6 billion net consideration to be received from the Seller resulting in a gain on bargain purchase of $1.4 billion. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we made certain adjustments to our estimates of the fair market value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed resulting in an increase to the gain on bargain purchase of $22.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. The total bargain purchase gain from the Transaction was $1.4 billion.

Interest Income - IP Transit Services Agreement.
 Under the IP Transit Services Agreement, TMUSA will pay us an aggregate of $700.0 million, consisting of (i) $350.0 million in equal monthly installments during the first year after the Closing Date and (ii) $350.0 million in equal monthly installments over the subsequent 42 months. The IP Transit Services Agreement was recorded in connection with the Transaction at its discounted present value resulting in a discount of $79.6 million. The amortization of the discount is recorded as interest income.
Interest Expense - Including Change in Valuation of Swap Agreement.
 Our interest expense resulted from interest incurred on our 2026 Notes, 2027 Notes, 2027 Mirror Notes, IPv4 Notes, Swap Agreement and finance lease obligations.
As of December 31, 2024, the fair value of our Swap Agreement was a net liability of $22.3 million. Changes in the valuation of the Swap Agreement are related to semi-annual interest payments in May and November and changes in interest rates, and are included in interest expense. Under the Swap Agreement settlement payments made in May 2023 and November 2023, we paid a total of $21.5 million to the counterparty for a net cash interest cost of $21.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Under the Swap Agreement settlement payments made in May 2024 and November 2024, we paid a total of $24.2 million to the counterparty for a net cash interest cost of $24.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. Our interest expense increased by 32.1% primarily due to the issuance of our IPv4 Notes in May 2024, the issuance of our 2027 Mirror Notes in June 2024 and the increase in payments under our Swap Agreement.
Income Tax Benefit.
 Our income tax benefit was $55.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and $54.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The change in our income tax benefit was primarily related to projected operating results related to the Sprint Business acquisition and the reversal of deferred tax liabilities acquired with the Sprint Business.
Buildings On-net.
 As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had a total of 3,453 and 3,277 on-net buildings connected to our network, respectively. The increase in our on-net buildings was a result of our disciplined network expansion program. We anticipate adding a similar number of buildings to our network for the next several years.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Acquisition of Sprint Communications
The Sprint Business’s cash flow was negative at the time of negotiations and during its recent history. Due to the dire financial condition of the Sprint Business, it was understood that a payment from T-Mobile to any potential buyer would be required to execute a transaction to give a buyer sufficient cash inflow to offset losses that would be expected until a buyer could optimize the business. Based on management’s internal modeling at the culmination of the due diligence process, management determined this cash payment to be $700.0 million. Management is reducing the negative cash flow of the Sprint Business through the payments from the IP Transit Services Agreement, reducing operating costs and increasing revenue primarily by providing optical wavelength and optical transport services over our fiber network, including the owned network we acquired with the Sprint Business. We are selling these services to our existing customers, customers we acquired with the Sprint Business and to new customers who require dedicated optical transport connectivity without the capital and ongoing expenses associated with owning and operating network infrastructure. As part of the Transaction, we began incurring costs associated with the TSA. The amount of these costs will be dependent upon our ability to integrate the operations of the Sprint Business into our operations. Our cash flow requirements related to the acquisition of the Sprint Business will be dependent upon our ability to reduce the acquired operating costs, our success in retaining the acquired customers and our ability to sell optical wavelength and optical transport services over our fiber network.
Under the IP Transit Services Agreement, TMUSA will pay us an aggregate of $700.0 million, consisting of (i) $350.0 million in equal monthly installments of $29.2 million per month during the first year after the Closing Date and (ii) $350.0 million in equal monthly installments of $8.3 million per month over the subsequent 42 months. Through December 31, 2024, we received monthly payments totaling $408.3 million under the IP Transit Services Agreement, reflected as cash flows from investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. As our business has grown as a result of an increasing customer base, the Transaction, broader geographic coverage and increased traffic on our network, we have historically produced a growing level of cash provided by operating activities. Since we closed the Transaction, we experienced a reduction of cash provided by operating activities from the impact of the Transaction. The cash received from the IP Transit Services Agreement was designed to offset operating losses associated with the Sprint Business. Increasing our cash provided by operating activities is, in part, dependent upon our ability to reduce the operating costs of the Sprint Business while retaining its profitable revenue, expanding our geographic footprint and increasing our network capacity.

During 2025, we expect to receive a total of $100.0 million under the monthly payments under the IP Transit Services Agreement. This includes 12 monthly payments of $8.3 million each. Increasing our cash provided by operating activities, is in part, dependent upon our ability to reduce the operating costs of the Sprint Business while retaining its profitable revenue.
In assessing our liquidity, management reviews and analyzes our current cash balances, payments under the IP Transit Services Agreement, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, capital expenditure commitments, and required finance lease and debt payments and other obligations. Because of the operating leverage of our network, our annual capital expenditures measured as a percentage of revenues has fallen over the last decade but increased in 2024 to 18.8% from 13.8% for 2023, primarily due to capital expenditures related to our acquisition of the Sprint Business, costs associated with providing wave services, conversion costs related to acquired data centers and adding buildings to our network.
To date, we have been able to raise capital by issuing notes and arranging financing and leases that have had more flexible terms at reasonable cost. Through our issuance of the IPv4 Notes, we have also been able to access new markets for raising capital. The combination of this improved operating performance and access to capital has preserved our financial flexibility and buttressed our ability to make distributions to stockholders in the form of cash dividends or through share repurchases. We have returned $1.6 billion to our stockholders through share repurchases and dividends. We will continue to assess our capital and liquidity needs and, where appropriate, return capital to stockholders.
Over the next several years, we have significant contractual and anticipated cash outlays, including our indicative dividend payments on our common stock, our maturing debt obligations, interest payments on our debt obligations and Swap Agreement and our projected capital expenditure requirements in order to help execute our business plan, including the integration of Sprint Business. Based upon the historical growth rate of our dividend, we expect that we would have to provide approximately $399 million in order to meet our expected quarterly dividend payments over the next two years. Our $500.0 million of 2026 Notes accrue interest at 3.50%, mature in May 2026 and include annual interest payments of $17.5 million until maturity. Our $450.0 million of 2027 Notes mature in June 2027 and include annual interest payments of $31.5 million until maturity. Our $300.0 million of 2027 Mirror Notes mature in June 2027 and include annual interest payments of $21.0 million until maturity. Our $206.0 million of IPv4 Notes effectively mature in May 2029 and include annual interest payments of $16.3 million until maturity (which amount increases if the IPv4 Notes are not repaid prior to May 2029).
Under our Swap Agreement, we pay the counterparty a semi-annual payment based upon overnight SOFR plus a contractual interest rate spread, and the counterparty pays us a semi-annual fixed 3.50% interest payment. These settlement payments are made in November and May of each year until the Swap Agreement expires in February 2026. As of December 31, 2024, $22.3 million of our cash and cash equivalents are restricted for use under our Swap Agreement. We have made a $23.4 million deposit with the counterparty to the Swap Agreement. If the fair value of the Swap Agreement exceeds a net liability of $23.4 million, we will be required to deposit additional funds with the counterparty equal to the liability fair value.
In June 2024, we elected to exercise a contractual option to prepay in full at a 12.0% discount rate an IRU finance lease agreement between us and a vendor we assumed with the Sprint Business for $114.6 million. At the payment date, the present value of the IRU finance lease liability was $117.9 million and the remaining thirty-one $4.2 million monthly principal payments totaled $130.2 million. The prepayment resulted in a gain on lease termination of $3.3 million related to the difference between the book value of $117.9 million and the cash payment of $114.6 million. We are continuing to use the related IRU asset.
We may need to, or elect to, refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness at or before maturity, and we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to refinance any such indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, we may elect to secure additional capital in the future, at acceptable terms, to improve our liquidity or fund acquisitions or for general corporate purposes. In addition, in an effort to reduce future cash interest payments as well as future amounts due at maturity or to extend debt maturities, we may, from time to time, issue new debt, enter into interest rate swap agreements, enter into debt for debt, or cash transactions to purchase our outstanding debt securities in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. We will evaluate any such transactions in light of the existing market conditions. The amounts involved in any such transaction, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. We or our affiliates may, at any time and from time to time, seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity or debt, in open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will be upon such terms and at such prices as we may determine, and will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.
In light of the economic uncertainties associated with the global economy, evolving hybrid work arrangements, the cash flow requirements of the Sprint Business, and the uncertain impact of proposed changes to economic and fiscal policies in the United States and other countries, our executive officers and Board of Directors have continued to carefully monitor our liquidity and cash

requirements as well as our capital spending. After consideration of these circumstances, we currently plan to continue our current dividend policy. As we do each year, we will continue to monitor our future sources and uses of cash, and anticipate that we will adjust our capital allocation strategies when, as and if determined by our Board of Directors.
As of December 31, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $227.9 million. The COVID-19 pandemic has not impacted our credit rating to date, nor do we believe that it has materially changed our cost of capital. We believe we are able to timely service our debt obligations and will not require any concessions to do so. We believe we will have access to additional capital from a variety of sources and the public capital markets for debt and equity.
Continued Impact of Changing Office Occupancy Rates
Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, we have experienced certain corporate customers taking a more cautious approach to new configurations and upgrades as well as a reduction in demand for connecting smaller satellite offices as a result of the challenges and uncertainties of the remote work environment that resulted initially from the pandemic. We also witnessed a deteriorating real estate market in and around the buildings we service with rising vacancy levels and falling lease initiations or renewals, which resulted in fewer sales opportunities for our salesforce and a reduction in VPN opportunities. As a result, we experienced a slowdown in new sales to our corporate customers, which negatively impacted our corporate revenue growth.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we continued to see declining vacancy rates compared to their peak during the pandemic and rising office occupancy rates in certain markets in which we operate continuing a trend that began following the end of the pandemic. Other markets, particularly those in California, Washington D.C. and the Pacific Northwest, continue to see markedly higher vacancy rates. These higher vacancy rates may represent a long-term change in office attendance and occupancy rates in these markets. Despite this overall environment, we are seeing some positive trends in our corporate business. This was partially due to the increase in office occupancy rates and leasing activity in some markets but also due to new demands for services from corporate customers. As the option to fully or partially work from home becomes permanently established at many companies, our corporate customers are integrating certain new applications that became part of the remote work environment, which benefits our corporate business as these customers upgrade their Internet access infrastructure to higher capacity connections, and mitigates the overall impact of remote work policies on our corporate business. Further, if and when companies eventually return to the buildings in which we operate, whether as existing or new tenants, we believe it will present an opportunity for increased sales.
While we believe that demand for office space in the buildings in which we operate will remain among the strongest in the markets in which they are located, and that most employers will eventually require their employees to return to their offices on at least a hybrid basis, the timing and scope of a return to office, particularly in a number of key markets we serve, remains uncertain. In some markets, office occupancy rates may never return to pre-2020 levels. As a result, we may continue to experience increased customer turnover, fewer upgrades of existing customer configurations and fewer new tenant opportunities. These trends may negatively impact our revenue growth, cash flows and profitability.

Net Cash (Used in) Provided by Operating Activities.
 Our primary source of operating cash is receipts from our customers who are billed on a monthly basis for our services. Our primary uses of operating cash are payments made to our vendors, payments made under the TSA, payments to employees and interest payments made to our finance lease vendors and our note holders. Our changes in cash provided by operating activities are primarily due to changes in net payments under the TSA, changes in our operating profit and changes in our interest payments.

On the Closing Date, we entered into a TSA with the Seller, pursuant to which the Seller provides to us, and we provide to the Seller on an interim basis following the Closing Date, Transition Services to ensure an orderly transition following the separation of the Sprint Business from Sprint Communications. Amounts billed under the TSA are due 30 days from receipt of the related invoice. During 2024 and 2023, we were billed $27.2 million and $284.1 million, respectively, under the TSA, primarily for reimbursement at cost of payments to vendors of the Sprint Business. During 2024 and 2023 we paid $93.8 million and $217.2 million to the Seller under the TSA, respectively. Amounts recorded and paid as due to the Seller under the TSA resulted in a use of cash in operating activities of $66.4 million for 2024 and contributed $66.9 million to net cash provided by operating activities for 2023.
Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities.
 Our primary use of cash for investing activities is for purchases of property and equipment. Purchases of property and equipment were $195.0 million, $129.6 million and $79.0 million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The changes in purchases of property and equipment were primarily due to the timing and scope of our network expansion activities including geographic expansion, purchases related to our acquisition of the Sprint Business, costs associated with providing wave services, conversion costs related to acquired data centers and adding buildings to our network.
Our primary source of cash provided by investing activities is our IP Transit Services Agreement with TMUSA. On the Closing Date, we entered into the IP Transit Services Agreement pursuant to which TMUSA will pay us an aggregate of $700.0 million, consisting of (i) $350.0 million in equal monthly installments during the first year after the Closing Date and (ii) $350.0 million in equal monthly installments over the subsequent 42 months. During 2024 and 2023 we were paid $204.2 million and $204.2 million under the IP Transit Services Agreement, respectively. In May 2023 we paid $61.1 million and acquired $47.1 million of cash and in 2023 we paid $5.0 million related to our acquisition of the Sprint Business. In 2024 and 2023 we received $12.3 million and $16.2 million of reimbursed severance payments, respectively, related to our acquisition of the Sprint Business. We received a combined net total of $14.5 million of cash received (including reimbursed severance payments) related to our acquisition of the Sprint Business.
Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities.
 Our primary uses of cash for financing activities are for dividend payments, principal payments under our finance lease obligations and purchases of our common stock. Our primary sources of cash for financing activities are issuances of note obligations. During 2024, 2023 and 2022, we paid $189.4 million, $181.7 million and $169.9 million, respectively, for our quarterly dividend payments. Our quarterly dividend payments have increased due to increases in our quarterly dividend per share amounts. Principal payments under our finance lease obligations were $74.6 million, $77.4 million and $45.5 million, respectively, In June 2024, we elected to exercise a contractual option to prepay in full at a 12.0% discount rate an IRU finance lease agreement between us and a vendor we assumed with the Sprint Business for $114.6 million. The other changes in our principal payments under our finance lease obligations were primarily due to the timing and extent of our network expansion activities including geographic expansion, purchases related to our acquisition of the Sprint Business, purchases associated with providing wave services and adding buildings to our network. During 2024, we purchased 153,322 shares of our common stock for $8.0 million. There were no purchases of our common stock in 2023 or 2022.
We completed a series of debt issuances and redemptions in 2024 and 2022.
On May 2, 2024, we issued $206.0 million aggregate principal amount of our IPv4 Notes, with an anticipated term ending in May 2029. The net proceeds from the offering, after debt offering costs, were $198.4 million. Interest on the IPv4 Notes is paid on a monthly basis. From and after May 2029, principal payments will also be required to be made on the IPv4 Notes on a monthly basis. No principal payments will be due on the IPv4 Notes prior to May 2029, unless certain rapid amortization or acceleration triggers are activated.
On June 11, 2024, Cogent Communications Group, LLC (“Group”) and Cogent Finance, Inc. (the “Co-Issuer” and, together with Group, the “Issuers”), two wholly owned subsidiaries of Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc. (“Holdings”), completed an offering of $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 2027 Mirror Notes. The 2027 Mirror Notes were issued at a price equal to 98.50% of their face value. The net proceeds from the offering were approximately $291.9 million after deducting the discount and offering expenses. The 2027 Mirror Notes bear interest at a rate of 7.00% per annum. Interest began to accrue on the 2027 Mirror Notes on June 11, 2024 and will be paid semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing on December 15, 2024. Unless earlier redeemed or repurchased, the 2027 Mirror Notes will mature on June 15, 2027.
In June 2022, we paid $375.4 million to redeem and extinguish our 2024 Notes at 101.094% of par value, and we issued $450.0 million of our 2027 Notes for net proceeds of $446.0 million.

Indebtedness
Our total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at December 31, 2024 were $227.9 million and our net accounts receivable were $96.9 million. We believe this level of liquidity reduces our exposure to refinancing risk, potential underperformance of the business or other unforeseen challenges and enhances our ability to pursue acquisitions or operating opportunities. We intend to hold levels of cash and cash equivalents sufficient to maintain our ability to fund operations and make dividend payments to our stockholders.
Our total indebtedness at December 31, 2024, at par value, was $2.0 billion. Our total indebtedness at December 31, 2024 includes $538.4 million of finance lease obligations for dark fiber under long-term IRU agreements.
Issuance of $300.0 Million Principal Amount of 2027 Mirror Notes
On June 11, 2024, the Issuers completed the offering of our 2027 Mirror Notes for issuance in a private placement not registered under the Securities Act. The 2027 Mirror Notes were offered and sold only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in an unregistered offering pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to certain non - U.S. persons in transactions outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. The 2027 Mirror Notes have the same maturity date and call protection, bear interest at the same rate and otherwise have substantially the same terms as our 2027 Notes; however, the 2027 Mirror Notes are not fungible (from a trading or tax perspective) with the 2027 Notes and are a separate series of notes from the 2027 Notes.
The 2027 Mirror Notes were issued at a price equal to 98.50% of their face value. The net proceeds from the offering were approximately $291.9 million after deducting the discount and offering expenses. We used $114.6 million of the net proceeds from the offering to exercise a contractual option to prepay in full in June 2024 an existing IRU agreement consisting of 31 remaining monthly recurring payments of $4.2 million, at a 12.0% discount rate. We expect to use the remainder of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes and/or to make special or recurring dividends to Holdings.
The 2027 Mirror Notes were issued pursuant to, and are governed by, an indenture, dated June 11, 2024 (the “2027 Mirror Notes Indenture”), among the Issuers, Holdings, the other guarantors named therein and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the “2027 Notes Trustee”). The 2027 Mirror Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed (the “Guarantees”) on a senior unsecured basis by each of Group’s existing and future material domestic subsidiaries (other than the Co-Issuer), subject to certain exceptions (collectively, the “Subsidiary Guarantors”), and by Holdings (together with the Subsidiary Guarantors, the “Guarantors”). However, the Holdings is not subject to the covenants under the 2027 Mirror Notes Indenture. Under certain circumstances, the Guarantors may be released from these Guarantees without the consent of the holders of the 2027 Mirror Notes.
The 2027 Mirror Notes and the Guarantees are the Issuers’ and the Guarantors’ senior unsecured obligations. The 2027 Mirror Notes and the Guarantees are effectively subordinated to all of the Issuers’ and the Guarantors’ existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness, and are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of subsidiaries that are not Subsidiary Guarantors. Without giving effect to collateral arrangements, the 2027 Mirror Notes and the Guarantees rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Issuers’ and the Guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness, including the 2026 Notes and the 2027 Notes. The 2027 Mirror Notes and the Guarantees rank contractually senior in right of payment to all of the Issuers’ and the Guarantors’ subordinated indebtedness and are structurally subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of the Issuers’ non-guarantor subsidiaries.
The 2027 Mirror Notes bear interest at a rate of 7.00% per annum. Interest began to accrue on the 2027 Mirror Notes on June 11, 2024 is paid semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, which commenced on December 15, 2024. Unless earlier redeemed or repurchased, the 2027 Mirror Notes will mature on June 15, 2027. After June 15, 2024, the Issuers may redeem the 2027 Mirror Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price ranging from 103.5% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Mirror Notes redeemed to par (depending on the year), in each case, as set forth in the 2027 Mirror Notes Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of redemption. 
If Group undergoes specific kinds of change in control accompanied by certain ratings events, the Issuers will be required to offer to repurchase the 2027 Mirror Notes from holders at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of repurchase. Additionally, if Group or any of its restricted subsidiaries sells assets and does not apply the proceeds from such sale in a certain manner or certain other events have not occurred, under certain circumstances, we will be required to use the net proceeds to make an offer to purchase the 2027 Mirror Notes at an offer price in cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2027 Mirror Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the 
Page 43 of 96

Table of Contents
repurchase date. In connection with any offer to purchase all or any of the 2027 Mirror Notes (including a change of control offer, asset sale offer or any tender offer), if holders of no less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 2027 Mirror Notes validly tender their 2027 Mirror Notes, the Issuers, or a third party, are entitled to redeem any remaining 2027 Mirror Notes at the price paid to each holder.
The 2027 Mirror Notes Indenture includes covenants that restrict Group and its restricted subsidiaries’ (including the Co-Issuer’s) ability to, among other things: incur indebtedness; issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities; pay dividends or make other distributions in respect of, or repurchase or redeem, capital stock; make certain investments and other restricted payments, such as prepayment, redemption or repurchase of certain indebtedness; create liens; consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of Group and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole; incur restrictions on the ability of a subsidiary to pay dividends or make other payments; or enter into transactions with affiliates. The covenants provide for certain exceptions to these restrictions, and Holdings is not subject to the covenants under the 2027 Mirror Notes Indenture. Certain covenants will cease to apply to the 2027 Mirror Notes if, and for so long as, the 2027 Mirror Notes have investment grade ratings from any two of Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Fitch Ratings, Inc. and S&P Global Ratings, and so long as no default or event of default under the 2027 Mirror Notes Indenture has occurred and is continuing. Upon suspension of the covenants, the Guarantees will be released until such time as the covenants are no longer suspended.
The principal amount of the 2027 Mirror Notes would become immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy or insolvency events and may be declared immediately due and payable by the 2027 Notes Trustee or the holders of at least 25% of the aggregate principal amount of the then-outstanding 2027 Mirror Notes upon the occurrence of certain events of default under the 2027 Mirror Notes Indenture. Events of default include the following with respect to the Issuers’ and Group’s significant subsidiaries: (i) failure to pay principal, premium or interest at required times; (ii) failure to comply with any other agreements in the 2027 Mirror Notes Indenture; (iii) default on certain material indebtedness that is caused by a failure to make a payment within any applicable grace period when due at maturity or results in the acceleration of such indebtedness prior to its express maturity; (iv) failure to pay certain material judgments; (v) a Guarantee being held unenforceable or invalid or ceasing for any reason to be in full force and effect or a Guarantor denying or disaffirming its obligations under its Guarantee; and (vi) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency.
Issuance of $206.0 Million Principal Amount of IPv4 Notes
On May 2, 2024, the IPv4 Issuer, our special-purpose, bankruptcy remote, indirect wholly owned subsidiary, issued $206.0 million aggregate principal amount of IPv4 Notes, with an anticipated term ending in May 2029 (such anticipated repayment date, the “ARD”), in an offering exempt from registration under the Securities Act. The net proceeds from the offering, after debt offering costs, were $198.4 million and are expected to be used for general corporate purposes.
The IPv4 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of May 2, 2024 (the “IPv4 Base Indenture”), as supplemented by the Series 2024-1 Supplement thereto, dated as of May 2, 2024 (the “Series 2024-1 Supplement”), in each case entered into by and between the IPv4 Issuer and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as the trustee for the IPv4 Notes (the “IPv4 Trustee”). The IPv4 Base Indenture allows the IPv4 Issuer to issue additional series of notes subject to certain conditions set forth therein, and the IPv4 Base Indenture, together with the Series 2024-1 Supplement, and any other series supplements to the IPv4 Base Indenture, is referred to herein as the “IPv4 Indenture.”
The IPv4 Notes were issued as part of a securitization transaction, pursuant to which certain Internet Protocol version 4 (“IPv4”) addresses, customer IPv4 address leases, customer accounts receivables and other IPv4 address assets (collectively, “IPv4 Address Assets”) were contributed or sold to the IPv4 Issuer and are included as collateral for the IPv4 Notes.
While the IPv4 Notes are outstanding, scheduled payments of interest are required to be made on a monthly basis. From and after the ARD, principal payments will also be required to be made on the IPv4 Notes on a monthly basis. No principal payments will be due on the IPv4 Notes prior to the ARD, unless certain rapid amortization or acceleration triggers are activated. 
Cogent Communications LLC (in such capacity, the “Manager”) performs certain monthly services related to the IPv4 Address Assets and IPv4 Notes including billing customers, collecting amounts paid by customers, forwarding payments to the IPv4 Trustee related to the IPv4 Address Assets and other administrative services. Amounts paid by the Manager to the IPv4 Trustee are reconciled on a monthly basis and the IPv4 Trustee pays the monthly interest on the IPv4 Notes and other expenses from the accumulated customer payments on the IPv4 Address Assets. Amounts held by the IPv4 Trustee before the monthly reconciliation is completed are considered restricted cash. After the IPv4 Trustee pays the monthly interest and other IPv4 Address Asset related costs, including monthly fees paid to the Manager for its services, the residual cash is paid to us and is unrestricted.

Table of Contents
The legal final maturity date of the IPv4 Notes is in May of 2054. If the IPv4 Issuer has not repaid or refinanced the IPv4 Notes prior to the monthly payment date in May of 2029, additional interest will accrue thereon in an amount equal to the greater of (i) 5.0% per annum and (ii) the excess amount, if any, by which the sum of the following exceeds the interest rate for such IPv4 Note: (A) the yield to maturity (adjusted to a “mortgage-equivalent basis” pursuant to the standards and practices of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association) on the ARD for such IPv4 Note of the United States Treasury Security having a remaining term closest to 10 years; plus (B) 5.0%; plus (C) the post-ARD note spread of 3.400% applicable to such Note.
The IPv4 Notes are obligations only of the IPv4 Issuer pursuant to the IPv4 Indenture, and are secured by a security interest in substantially all of the IPv4 Address Assets pursuant to the IPv4 Indenture. The IPv4 Notes are guaranteed by Cogent IPv4 Holdco LLC, a special-purpose entity and our indirect wholly owned subsidiary, as the guarantor (the “IPv4 Guarantor”), pursuant to a guaranty dated as of May 2, 2024 (the “Guaranty”), by the IPv4 Guarantor in favor of the IPv4 Trustee, pursuant to which the IPv4 Guarantor has granted a security interest in the equity interests of the IPv4 Issuer as collateral security for its obligations under the Guaranty. Except as described below, neither we nor any of our subsidiaries, other than the IPv4 Issuer and the IPv4 Guarantor, will guarantee or in any way be liable for the obligations of the IPv4 Issuer under the IPv4 Indenture or the IPv4 Notes.
The IPv4 Notes are subject to a series of covenants and restrictions customary for transactions of this type. These covenants and restrictions include (i) that the IPv4 Issuer maintains a liquidity reserve account to be used to make required payments in respect of the IPv4 Notes such amount considered restricted cash, (ii) provisions relating to optional and mandatory prepayments, including specified make - whole payments in the case of certain optional prepayments of the IPv4 Notes prior to the monthly payment date in May of 2028, (iii) certain indemnification payments in the event, among other things, that the transfers of the assets pledged as collateral for the IPv4 Notes are in stated ways defective or ineffective and (iv) covenants relating to recordkeeping, access to information and similar matters. As provided in the IPv4 Base Indenture, the IPv4 Notes are also subject to rapid amortization in the event of a failure to maintain a stated debt service coverage ratio as defined in the IPv4 Indenture. A rapid amortization may be cured if the debt service coverage ratio exceeds a certain threshold for a certain period of time, upon which cure, regular amortization, if any, will resume. In addition, if certain utilization thresholds are not met (i.e., the proportion of IP addresses that are leased to the total number of IP addresses owned by the IPv4 Issuer falls below certain thresholds), the IPv4 Issuer will be required to apply collections to the repayment of the IPv4 Notes, and in certain circumstances, the noteholders will have the ability to direct a sale of the IP Address Assets, in whole or in part, pursuant to the terms set forth in the IPv4 Indenture. The IPv4 Notes are also subject to certain customary events of default, including events relating to non - payment of required interest, principal or other amounts due on or with respect to the IPv4 Notes, failure to comply with covenants within certain time frames, certain bankruptcy events, breaches of specified representations and warranties, failure of security interests to be effective and certain judgments.

Limitations Under the Indentures
The indentures governing the 2026 Notes, the 2027 Notes and the 2027 Mirror Notes (the “Indentures”), among other things, limit the ability of Group and its restricted subsidiaries to incur indebtedness; to pay dividends or make other distributions; to make certain investments and other restricted payments; to create liens; to consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets; to incur restrictions on the ability of a subsidiary to pay dividends or make other payments; and to enter into certain transactions with its affiliates. There are certain exceptions to the limitations on the ability to incur indebtedness under the Indentures, including IRU agreements incurred in the normal course of business and any additional indebtedness if Group’s consolidated leverage ratio, as defined in the Indentures, is less than 6.0 to 1.0 or Group’s fixed charge coverage ratio, as defined in the Indentures, is 2.0 to 1.0 or greater. Group and its subsidiaries can also incur unlimited liens (which can be used, together with capacity under the debt covenant, to incur additional secured indebtedness) if Group’s consolidated secured leverage ratio, as defined in the Indentures, is less than 4.0 to 1.0. Under the Indentures, Group and its restricted subsidiaries can pay dividends, make other distributions, make certain investments and make other restricted payments under certain circumstances, including if, after giving pro forma effect to such restricted payment, Group could still incur $1 of “Ratio Debt,”, as defined (i.e., either its consolidated leverage ratio is less than 6.0 to 1.0 or its fixed charge coverage ratio is 2.0 to 1.0 or greater). As of December 31, 2024, Group’s consolidated leverage ratio was below 6.0, Group’s consolidated secured leverage ratio was below 4.0 and Group’s fixed charge coverage ratio was above 2.0. As of December 31, 2024, a total of $303.6 million was unrestricted and permitted for restricted payments, including dividends and stock purchases.
Summarized Financial Information of Holdings
Neither Holdings nor any of its subsidiaries that is not also a subsidiary of Group is a “Restricted Subsidiary” as defined under the Indentures. Holdings is a guarantor under these notes, but none of its subsidiaries that is not also a subsidiary of Group is a guarantor under these notes. Under the Indentures, we are required to disclose certain reasonably related information of Holdings and its subsidiaries that is not attributable to Group and its subsidiaries, relating to Holdings’ assets, liabilities and operating results (“Holdings Financial Information”).

Common Stock Buyback Program
Our Board of Directors has approved purchases of our common stock under a buyback program (the “Buyback Program”) through December 31, 2025. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we purchased 153,322 shares of our common stock for $8.0 million. There were no purchases of our common stock during the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2024, there was a total of $22.4 million available under the Buyback Program.
Dividends on Common Stock
Dividends are recorded as a reduction to retained earnings. Dividends on unvested restricted shares of common stock are paid as the awards vest. Our initial quarterly dividend payment was made in the third quarter of 2012. On February 26, 2025, our Board of Directors approved the payment of our quarterly dividend of $1.005 per common share. The dividend for the first quarter of 2025 will be paid to holders of record on March 13, 2025. This estimated $47.8 million dividend payment is expected to be made on March 28, 2025. The payment of any future dividends and any other returns of capital, including stock buybacks, will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and may be reduced, eliminated or increased and will be dependent upon our financial position, results of operations, available cash, cash flow, capital requirements, limitations under our debt indentures and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. We are a Delaware Corporation and under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware distributions may be restricted including a restriction that distributions, including stock purchases and dividends, do not result in an impairment of a corporation’s capital, as defined under Delaware Law. The Indentures limit our ability to return cash to our stockholders. See Note 4 “Long-term Debt” to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of limitations on distributions.

Future Capital Requirements
We believe that our cash on hand and cash generated from our operating activities and cash from the IP Transit Services Agreement will be adequate to meet our working capital, capital expenditure, debt service, dividend payments and other cash requirements for the next 12 months and beyond the next 12 months if we execute our business plan.
Any future acquisitions or other significant unplanned costs or cash requirements in excess of amounts we currently hold may require that we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt or equity. In addition, our 2026 Notes will mature in May 2026. At that time we will need to repay our 2026 Notes which may require us to issue additional indebtedness. We cannot assure you that such financing will be available on terms acceptable to us or our stockholders, or at all. Insufficient funds may require us to delay or scale back the number of buildings and markets that we add to our network, reduce our planned increase in our sales and marketing efforts, reduce our planned dividend payments, or require us to otherwise alter our business plan or take other actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If issuing equity securities raises additional funds, substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result.
We may need to, or elect to, refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness at or before maturity and we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to refinance any such indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, we may elect to secure additional capital in the future, at acceptable terms, to improve our liquidity or fund acquisitions or for general corporate purposes. In addition, in an effort to reduce future cash interest payments as well as future amounts due at maturity or to extend debt maturities, we may, from time to time, issue new debt, enter into debt for debt, or cash transactions to purchase our outstanding debt securities in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. We will evaluate any such transactions in light of the existing market conditions. The amounts involved in any such transaction, individually or in the aggregate, may be material.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships.
Income Taxes
Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code in the United States limits the utilization of net operating losses when ownership changes, as defined by that section, occur. We have performed an analysis of our Section 382 ownership changes and have determined that the utilization of certain of our net operating loss carryforwards in the United States is limited.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
The accounting policies we believe to be most critical to understanding our financial results and condition or that require complex, significant and subjective management judgments are discussed below.
Acquisition accounting
In connection with our acquisition of the Sprint Business we made the following significant changes to our critical accounting policies and significant estimates. For the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we used the cost, income and market approaches, including market participant assumptions.
​
Page 48 of 96

Table of Contents
In connection with the Transaction, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair values as of the acquisition date. Assigning fair market values to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of an acquisition requires the use of significant judgment regarding estimates and assumptions. We acquired property and equipment comprised of the legacy Sprint network and consists of optical fiber, related equipment, and owned real estate. Management valued these assets using factors that represent an orderly liquidation value, to approximate the highest and best use of assets acquired in a distressed business.
The valuation of the optical fiber requires the estimation of the total replacement cost per mile of fiber and a factor to reflect the orderly liquidation value. There is not active market data for these assumptions and these assumptions are inherently subjective. Market participants could have differing views on these assumptions, which could result in a materially different fair value of the optical fiber.
On the Closing Date, we entered into the IP Transit Services Agreement. We evaluated what elements were part of the business combination and the consideration exchanged to complete the Transaction. We concluded that the payments to be made represent consideration received from T-Mobile to complete the acquisition of a distressed business. We concluded that T-Mobile did not represent a customer, the stated contract price did not represent consideration for services to be delivered, and the transaction did not satisfy the definition of revenue. We also considered whether the IP Transit Services Agreement would be considered separable from the business combination. We concluded that the cash consideration was not separately identifiable from the business combination and was therefore not meant to be in exchange for a distinct good or service. As a result, the IP Transit Services Agreement was recorded in connection with the Transaction at its discounted present value resulting in a discount. The interest rate used in determining the present value was derived considering rates on similar issued debt instruments with comparable durations, among other market factors. The determination of the discount rate and the conclusions reached related to the IP Transit Services Agreement required significant judgment.
The Purchase Agreement includes an estimated payment from Seller to Buyer related to short-term lease obligations. This amount was recorded at its present value resulting in a discount. The interest rate used in determining the present value was derived considering rates on similar issued debt instruments with comparable durations, among other market factors. The determination of the discount rate requires some judgment.
In connection with the Transaction, we recorded an intangible asset totaling $458.0 million for acquired IPv4 addresses. This asset was recorded once management determined both the quantity of IPv4 addresses for which title was transferred and the valuation approach. Because of the novel nature of this asset and that the Transaction has resulted in a material bargain purchase gain, management recorded the asset after appropriate consideration of the valuation approach, in the context of a distressed business. The fair value measurement of the IPv4 addresses was based on recent auction prices and a factor to incorporate the uncertainty for how the market for IPv4 addresses will function in the future. We believe that these IPv4 addresses have an indefinite useful life and are not being amortized. We evaluate the IPv4 intangible asset for impairment on the first day of the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. In performing our impairment assessment, we first evaluated qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. The factors we evaluated include market data for sales and leases of IPv4 addresses and cash flows associated with the asset. Upon consideration of these factors we determined that it was not more-likely-than-not that the asset was impaired, and that a quantitative impairment assessment was not required.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
We are exposed to certain market risks. These risks, which include interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk, arise in the normal course of business rather than from trading activities.
Interest Rate Risk
Interest Expense and Restricted Cash
Our cash flow exposure due to changes in interest rates related to our IPv4 Notes, 2027 Mirror Notes and 2027 Notes is limited as these notes have fixed interest rates. Beginning in August 2021, we used a swap agreement to manage our interest rate risk on our 2026 Notes. Our Swap Agreement has the economic effect of modifying our fixed-interest rate obligation associated with our 2026 Notes to a variable interest rate obligation based on SOFR. The Swap Agreement is recorded at its fair value at each reporting period and we incur gains and losses due to changes in market interest rates. The values that we report for the Swap Agreement as of each reporting date are recognized as an additional non-cash interest expense or a reduction to interest expense with the corresponding amount included in liabilities or assets, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets. By entering into this Swap Agreement, we have assumed the risk associated with variable interest rates based upon SOFR related to our 2026 Notes. We have not entered into hedge agreements related to our IPv4 Notes, 2027 Mirror Notes or 2027 Notes, and we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. We have a $23.4 million interest-bearing deposit with the counterparty to our Swap Agreement. If the fair value of the Swap Agreement exceeds a net liability of $23.4 million, we will be required to deposit additional funds with the counterparty equal to the net liability that is in excess of the deposit. As of December 31, 2024, the fair value of the Swap Agreement was a liability of $22.3 million, and as a result, $22.3 million of the deposit was restricted and $1.1 million was unrestricted. A 1.0% change in interest rates as of December 31, 2024 would impact the change in the valuation of our Swap Agreement by approximately $6.2 million.
Interest Income
Our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates. However, based upon the nature and current level of our investments, which consist of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, we believe that there is no material interest rate exposure related to our investments.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
Our operations outside of the United States expose us to potentially unfavorable adverse movements in foreign currency rate changes. We have not entered into forward exchange contracts related to our foreign currency exposure. While we record financial results and assets and liabilities from our international operations in the functional currency, which is generally the local currency, these results are reflected in our consolidated financial statements in US dollars. Therefore, our reported results are exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rates between the US dollar and the local currencies, in particular the Euro and the Canadian dollar. In addition, we may fund certain cash flow requirements of our international operations in US dollars. Accordingly, in the event that the local currencies strengthen versus the US dollar to a greater extent than planned, the revenues, expenses and cash flow requirements associated with our international operations may be significantly higher in US-dollar terms than planned. During the year ended December 31, 2024, our foreign activities accounted for 17.4% of our consolidated revenue. A 1.0% change in foreign exchange rates would impact our consolidated annual revenue by approximately $1.4 million. Changes in foreign currency rates could adversely and materially affect our operating results and cash flow.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2 (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 28, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Assessment of Indefinite-lived Intangible Asset for Impairment
Description of the Matter
​
At December 31, 2024, the Company’s IPv4 address indefinite-lived intangible asset was $458.0 million. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the IPv4 address indefinite-lived intangible asset is evaluated for impairment annually on the first day of the fourth quarter, or more frequently when indicators of impairment exist. The Company did not record any impairment of the IPv4 address indefinite-lived intangible asset during the year. 
Auditing management’s assessment of the indefinite-lived intangible asset for impairment was complex due to the judgment required in the identification of events or circumstances that were impairment indicators. Significant auditor judgment was required in evaluating management’s identification of the relevant factors to consider in determining whether an indicator of impairment existed due to limited available market data.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
​
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s assessment of the IPv4 address indefinite-lived intangible asset for impairment. For example, we tested controls over management’s identification and consideration of the most relevant drivers of changes in fair value. 
To test the Company’s assessment of the indefinite-lived intangible asset for impairment, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the Company’s identification and consideration of the most relevant drivers of changes in fair value and evaluating the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis. The underlying data used by the Company in its analysis included, among others, market data for sales and leases of IPv4 addresses and cash flows associated with the IPv4 addresses.

1. Description of the business and summary of significant accounting policies:
Reorganization and merger
On May 15, 2014, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization by and among Cogent Communications Group, Inc. (now Cogent Communications Group, LLC), a Delaware corporation (“Group”), Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Holdings”), and Cogent Communications Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation, Group adopted a new holding company organizational structure whereby Group is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings. Holdings is a “successor issuer” to Group pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). References to the “Company” for events that occurred prior to May 15, 2014 refer to Cogent Communications Group, Inc. (now Cogent Communications Group, LLC) and its subsidiaries, and on and after May 15, 2014, the “Company” refers to Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Cogent Communications, LLC (formerly Cogent Communications, Inc.) is wholly owned by Group, Sprint Communications Company LP is indirectly wholly owned by Holdings, and the vast majority of the Company’s assets, contractual arrangements, and operations are executed by Sprint Communications Company LP and Cogent Communications, LLC.
Description of business
The Company is a facilities-based provider of low-cost, high-speed Internet access, private network services, optical wavelength and optical transport services and data center colocation space and power. The Company’s network is specifically designed and optimized to transmit packet routed data. The Company delivers its services primarily to businesses, large and small, communications service providers and other bandwidth-intensive organizations in 
56
 countries across North America, Europe, South America, Oceania and Africa. The Company is a Delaware corporation and is headquartered in Washington, DC.
The Company offers on-net Internet access services exclusively through its own facilities, which run from its network to its customers’ premises. The Company offers its on-net services to customers located in buildings that are physically connected to its network. As a result, the Company is not dependent on local telephone companies or cable TV companies to serve its customers for its on-net Internet access and private network services. The Company’s on-net service consists of high-speed Internet access and private network services offered at speeds ranging from 
100
 megabits per second to 
400
 gigabits per second. 
The Company provides its on-net Internet access and private network services to its corporate, net-centric and enterprise customers. The Company’s corporate customers are located in multi-tenant office buildings that typically include law firms, financial services firms, advertising and marketing firms, as well as health care providers, educational institutions and other professional services businesses. The Company’s net-centric customers include bandwidth-intensive users that leverage its network either to deliver content to end users or to provide access to residential or commercial Internet users. Content delivery customers include over the top media service providers, content delivery networks, web hosting companies, and commercial content and application software providers. The Company’s net-centric customers include access networks comprised of other Internet Service Providers, telephone companies, mobile phone operators and cable television companies that collectively provide internet access to a substantial number of broadband subscribers and mobile phone subscribers across the world. These net-centric customers generally receive the Company’s services in carrier neutral colocation facilities and in the Company’s own data centers. The Company operates data centers throughout North America and Europe that allow its customers to collocate their equipment and access the Company’s network.
In addition to providing on-net services, the Company provides Internet access and private network services to customers that are not located in buildings directly connected to its network. The Company provides these off-net services primarily to corporate customers using other carriers’ circuits to provide the “last mile” portion of the link from the customers’ premises to the Company’s network. The Company also provides certain non-core services that resulted from acquisitions, including the acquisition of Sprint Communications (as discussed below). The Company continues to support but does not actively sell these non-core services. In connection with the Company’s acquisition of Sprint Communications, the Company began to provide optical wavelength services and optical transport services over a network that is generally independent of the Company’s legacy IP network. The Company is selling these wavelength services to its existing customers, customers of Sprint Communications and to new customers who require dedicated optical transport connectivity without the capital and ongoing expenses associated with owning and operating network infrastructure. Additionally, the Sprint Business (as defined below) customers include a number of companies larger than the Company’s historical customer base. In connection with the acquisition of Sprint Communications, the Company expanded selling services to these larger “Enterprise” customers.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, “
Segment Reporting (Topic 280) Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures”
 (ASU 2023-07”). ASU 2023-07 modified the reporting and disclosure requirements under Accounting Standards Codification 280 “
Segment Reporting
.” The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 in the year ended December 31, 2024 and has made the additional disclosures required under ASU 2023-07 in Note 10.
In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, “
Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers
” (“ASU 2021-08”). ASU 2021-08 requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in accordance with Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), as if the acquirer had originated the contracts at the date of the business combination. ASU 2021-08 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption was permitted.
The Company adopted ASU 2021-08 in connection with its acquisition of Sprint Communications (as discussed below), at which time it became applicable to the Company and was applied in the accounting for the acquisition. The adoption did not have a material impact on the opening balance sheet recorded and there was no retrospective impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements as a result of the adoption.
Acquisition of Sprint Communications
On September 6, 2022, Cogent Infrastructure, Inc. (now Cogent Infrastructure, LLC), a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Buyer” and “Cogent Infrastructure”), entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Sprint Communications LLC, a Kansas limited liability company (“Sprint Communications”) and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of T-Mobile US, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“T-Mobile”), and Sprint LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of T-Mobile (the “Seller”), pursuant to which the Company acquired the U.S. long-haul fiber network (including the non-U.S. extensions thereof) of Sprint Communications and its subsidiaries (the “Sprint Business”). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company purchased from the Seller all of the issued and outstanding membership interests (the “Purchased Interests”) of Wireline Network Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company that, following an internal restructuring and divisive merger, holds Sprint Communications’ assets and liabilities relating to the Sprint Business (such transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, collectively, the “Transaction”). The Purchase Agreement includes customary representations, warranties, indemnities and covenants, including regarding the conduct of the Sprint Business prior to the closing of the Transaction (the “Closing”). In addition, the Closing was subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of certain required regulatory approvals and consents.
The Company believes it is in a unique position to monetize the Sprint Business and its network and management expects to achieve significant cost reduction synergies and revenue synergies from the Transaction. Revenue and pre-tax loss for the Sprint Business included in the Company’s consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $
283.3
 million and $
234.5
 million, respectively.
Purchase Price
The Transaction closed on May 1, 2023 (the “Closing Date”). On the Closing Date, the Buyer consummated the Transaction pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, providing a purchase price of $
1
 payable to the Seller for the Purchased Interests, subject to customary adjustments, including working capital (the “Working Capital Adjustment”), as set forth in the Purchase Agreement. As consideration for the Purchased Interests, the Working Capital Adjustment (primarily related to acquired cash and cash equivalents of an estimated $
43.4
 million at the Closing Date in order to fund the international operations of the Sprint Business) resulted in the Buyer making a payment to the Seller of $
61.1
 million on the Closing Date. During the third quarter of 2023, an additional Working Capital Adjustment of $
5.0
 million was accrued due to the Seller. The final determination of the Working Capital Adjustment (which included the Short - term Lease Payment below) was completed in April 2024 and the Company paid the Seller $
5.0
 million for the remaining Working Capital Adjustment.
Short-term lease payment
The Purchase Agreement also provides for a payment of $
28.1
 million ($
19.8
 million net of discount) from the Seller to the Buyer related to acquired short-term operating lease obligations (the “Short-term Lease Payment”). The Short-term Lease Payment will be paid from the Seller to the Company in 
four
 equal payments in months 
55
 to 
58
 after the Closing Date. The final determination of the Short-term Lease Payment was completed in April 2024. The Short - term Lease Payment was recorded at its present value resulting 
Page 59 of 96

Table of Contents
in a discount of $
8.4
 million. The interest rate used in determining the present value was derived considering rates on similar issued debt instruments with comparable durations, among other market factors. The determination of the discount rate requires some judgment. During the third quarter of 2023, the Short-term Lease Payment was reduced by $
4.8
 million and in the first quarter of 2024, the Short-term Lease Payment was reduced by an additional $
17.0
 million, net of discount of $
7.2
 million. Including the cumulative impact of these adjustments, the amortization of the discount resulted in interest income of $
0.7
 million and $
1.9
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Severance reimbursements
The Purchase Agreement also provides for reimbursement from the Seller to the Buyer for qualifying severance expenses incurred. Total qualifying severance expenses were $
28.6
 million of which $
12.3
 million were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2024 and $
16.2
 million were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2023. These severance payments ended in the second quarter of 2024.
IP Transit Services Agreement
On the Closing Date, Cogent Communications, Inc. (now Cogent Communications, LLC), and T-Mobile USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation and direct subsidiary of T-Mobile (“TMUSA”), entered into an agreement for IP transit services (“IP Transit Services Agreement”), pursuant to which TMUSA will pay an affiliate of the Company an aggregate of $
700.0
 million, consisting of (i) $
350.0
 million in equal monthly installments of $
29.2
 million per month during the first year after the Closing Date and (ii) $
350.0
 million in equal monthly installments of $
8.3
 million per month over the subsequent 42 months. Under the IP Transit Services Agreement., TMUSA paid the Company $
204.2
 million and $
204.2
 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The Company accounted for the Transaction as a business combination under ASC Topic 805 
Business Combinations
 (“ASC 805”). The Company evaluated what elements are part of the business combination and the consideration exchanged to complete the acquisition. Under ASC 805, the Company has concluded that the $
700.0
 million of payments to be made represent consideration received from T - Mobile to complete the acquisition of a distressed business. The Company also evaluated whether the IP Transit Services Agreement was in the scope of ASU No. 2014 - 09 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 (“ASC 606”). The Company has concluded that T - Mobile did not represent a “customer” as defined by ASC 606, the stated contract price did not represent consideration for services to be delivered, and the transaction did not satisfy the definition of revenue, which excluded this arrangement from the scope of ASC 606. As a result, and considering statements made by T - Mobile, the IP Transit Services Agreement was recorded in connection with the Transaction at its discounted present value resulting in a discount of $
79.6
 million. The interest rate used in determining the present value was derived considering rates on similar issued debt instruments with comparable durations, among other market factors. The determination of the discount rate requires some judgment. The amortization of the discount resulted in interest income of $
23.8
 million and $
26.8
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Transition Services Agreement
On the Closing Date, the Buyer entered into a transition services agreement (the “TSA”) with the Seller, pursuant to which the Seller provides to the Buyer, and the Buyer provides to the Seller on an interim basis following the Closing Date, certain specified services (the “Transition Services”) to ensure an orderly transition following the separation of the Sprint Business from Sprint Communications. The services provided by the Seller to the Buyer include, among others, information technology support, back office and finance, real estate and facilities, vendor and supply chain management, including the payment and processing of vendor invoices for the Company and human resources services. The services provided by the Buyer to the Seller include, among others, information technology and network support, finance and back office and other wireless business support.
The Transition Services are generally intended to be provided for a period of up to 
two years
 following the Closing Date, although such period may be extended for an additional 
one-year
 term by either party upon 
30 days
’ prior written notice. The fees for the Transition Services are calculated using either a per service monthly fee or an hourly rate for the employees allocated to provide such services. Any third-party costs incurred in providing the Transition Services are passed on to the party receiving such services at cost for the 
two-year
 period. Amounts paid for the Sprint Business by T-Mobile are reimbursed at cost.
Either party to the TSA may terminate the agreement with respect to any individual service in full for convenience upon 
30 days
’ prior written notice for certain services and reduced for other services after a 
90-day
 period. The TSA may be terminated in its entirety if the other party has failed to perform any of its material obligations and such failure is not cured within 30 days. The TSA provides for customary indemnification and limits on liability. Amounts billed under the TSA are due 
30 days
 from receipt of the related 
Page 60 of 96

invoice. Amounts billed to the Company under the TSA were primarily for reimbursement at cost of payments to vendors of the Sprint Business until these vendors are fully transitioned to the Company. The amounts due from the Seller were primarily reimbursements for severance costs related to Sprint Business employees and services provided by the Company for the Seller.
During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company was billed $
27.2
 million and $
284.1
 million as due to the Seller under the TSA, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company paid $
93.8
 million and $
217.2
 million to the Seller under the TSA, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company billed the Seller $
1.1
 million and $
6.2
 million as due from the Seller under the TSA, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Seller paid the Company $
1.3
 million and $
6.0
 million under the TSA, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, the Company owed $
0.5
 million to the Seller and the Seller owed $
0.1
 million to the Company under the TSA. As of December 31, 2023, the Company owed $
66.9
 million to the Seller and the Seller owed $
4.5
 million to the Company under the TSA.
Other Services Provided to the Seller
In addition, on the Closing Date, the Buyer and TMUSA entered into a commercial agreement (the “Commercial Agreement”) for colocation and connectivity services, pursuant to which the Company will provide such services to TMUSA for a per service monthly fee plus certain third-party costs incurred in providing the services. Under the Commercial Agreement, the Company recorded revenue of $
14.7
 million and $
23.9
 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, TMUSA owed $

Fair Value of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed and Gain on Bargain Purchase
The Company accounted for the Transaction as a business combination under ASC Topic 805 
Business Combination
 (“ASC 805”). Under ASC 805, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair values as of the Closing Date. Assigning fair market values to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of an acquisition requires the use of significant judgment regarding estimates and assumptions. For the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the Company used the cost, income and market approaches, including market participant assumptions. The fair value of the identifiable assets acquired (including amounts due under the IP Transit Services Agreement) were in excess of the liabilities assumed and the net consideration to be paid resulting in a gain on bargain purchase of $
1.4
 billion.
The Transaction is considered an asset purchase for income tax purposes. The tax basis of the acquired business is the consideration paid ($
1
) plus the tax basis of certain liabilities assumed, with adjustments for cash acquired in excess of the purchase price. Deferred income taxes were recorded based upon the difference between the book and tax basis of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities at the Company’s marginal effective income tax rate on the Closing Date.
During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded measurement period adjustments resulting in increases to the gain on bargain purchase of $
22.2
 million and $
254.0
 million, respectively, as detailed below: 
During the third quarter of 2023, the Company recorded a measurement period adjustment to reclassify $
24.9
 million from right-of-use leased assets (net of related unfavorable lease liability amount) to finance lease assets (presented within property and equipment) and a measurement period adjustment to reclassify $
160.9
 million from operating lease liabilities to a finance lease liability. 
During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company recorded the following measurement period adjustments resulting in an increase to the gain on bargain purchase of $
254.0
 million. Excluding the impact to the bargain purchase gain, the corresponding impact from these adjustments to the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive loss for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 and for the period from May 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 was not material.
●
An intangible asset totaling 
$
458.0
 million for acquired IPv4 addresses. This asset was recorded once management determined both the quantity of IPv4 addresses for which title was transferred and the valuation approach. Because of the novel nature of this asset and that the Transaction resulted in a material bargain purchase gain, management recorded the asset after appropriate consideration of the valuation approach, in the context of a distressed business.
●
A reduction to an intangible asset, acquired customer relationships, totaling 
$
41.0
 million from revisions to certain assumptions.
●
A reduction to acquired owned property totaling 
$
86.4
 million from revisions to certain assumptions.
●
Severance reimbursement payments received from the Seller Includes totaling 
$
16.2
 million recorded as a measurement period adjustment during the fourth quarter.
●
Other less significant adjustments.
●
An increase to the net deferred tax liability totaling 
$
89.5
 million from the impact of the adjustments noted above.
During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company recorded a measurement period adjustment resulting in a reduction to the gain on bargain purchase of $
5.5
 million which included;
●
A reduction to the Short-term Lease Receivable of 
$

Acquired Property & Equipment
The Company acquired property and equipment of $
965.7
 million. This is primarily comprised of the legacy Sprint network and consists of optical fiber, related equipment, and owned real estate that were valued using a combination of cost and market approaches. Management intends to operate the acquired business; however, management valued these assets using factors that represent an orderly liquidation value, to approximate the highest and best use of assets acquired in a distressed business. 
Page 63 of 96

Table of Contents
The estimated fair value of the optical fiber on the Closing Date was $
369.2
 million. The valuation required the estimation of the total replacement cost per mile of fiber and a factor to reflect the orderly liquidation value. There is no active market data for these assumptions and these assumptions are inherently subjective. Market participants could have differing views on these assumptions, which could result in a materially different fair value of the optical fiber.
Acquired Leases
The Company acquired a portfolio of lease arrangements for the lease of dark fiber, rights-of-way and facilities. In accordance with ASC 805 and ASC Topic 842 
Leases
, the acquired leases are accounted for as if the leases were new at the acquisition date however, the Company retains the lease classification from the Seller. The Company followed its historical policies with respect to evaluating the renewal periods of the acquired leases and estimating the incremental borrowing rate. During the third quarter of 2023, the Company recorded a measurement period adjustment to reclassify $
24.9
 million from right-of-use leased assets (net of related unfavorable lease liability amount) to finance lease assets (presented within property and equipment) and a measurement period adjustment to reclassify $
160.9
 million from operating lease liabilities to a finance lease liability.
The Company also evaluated the leases for unfavorable terms and recorded an adjustment for unfavorable market terms of $
157.2
 million that was valued using the income approach. Unfavorable lease liabilities are presented net of the corresponding right-of-use assets.
Acquired Intangible Assets
Intangible assets acquired include $
458.0
 million of Internet Protocol version 4 (“IPv4”) addresses and $
16.0
 million of acquired customer relationships. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company recorded a reduction to acquired customer relationships, totaling $
41.0
 million from revisions to certain assumptions. The acquired customer relationships have an estimated useful life of 
nine years
 and the estimated fair value was determined using a market-based income approach. Amortization expense was $
1.8
 million and $
1.3
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Future amortization expense of the customer relationships is $
1.8
 million per year for 
seven years
.
The fair value measurement of the IPv4 addresses was based on recent auction prices and a factor to incorporate the uncertainty for how the market for IPv4 addresses will function in the future. The Company believes that these IPv4 addresses have an indefinite useful life and are not being amortized. The Company evaluates the IPv4 address asset for impairment on the first day of the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. In performing the impairment assessment, the Company may first evaluate qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. Upon consideration of relevant factors, the Company concluded that it was not more-likely-than-not that impairment was present, and therefore, a quantitative impairment assessment was not required. There was no impairment recorded during the period from May 1, 2023 through December 31, 2024.
Acquired Asset Retirement Obligations
In connection with the Transaction, the Company assumed $
32.0
 million of asset retirement obligations primarily related to restoration obligations for acquired leases that were valued using the income approach. In accordance with ASC 410, the Company has not recorded an asset retirement obligation related to the removal of the acquired optical fiber because a settlement date for which to remove the fiber is indeterminable and therefore a reasonable estimation of fair value cannot be made.
Reassessment of Bargain Purchase Gain
Because the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeded the fair value of the consideration transferred, the Company recorded a material bargain purchase gain. Consequently, the Company reassessed the recognition and measurement of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in accordance with ASC 805-30-25-4 and concluded that all acquired assets and assumed liabilities were recognized and that the valuation procedures and resulting measures were appropriate.

Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles and include the accounts of the Company and all of its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.
Use of estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Allowance for credit losses
The Company establishes an allowance for credit losses and other sales credit adjustments related to its trade receivables. Trade receivables are recorded at the invoiced amount and can bear interest. Allowances for sales credits are established through a reduction of revenue, while allowances for credit losses are established through a charge to selling, general, and administrative expenses as bad debt expense. The Company assesses the adequacy of these reserves by evaluating factors, such as the length of time individual receivables are past due, historical collection experience, and changes in the credit worthiness of its customers. The Company also assesses the ability of specific customers to meet their financial obligations and establishes specific allowances related to these customers. If circumstances relating to specific customers change or economic conditions change such that the Company’s past collection experience and assessment of the economic environment are no longer appropriate, the Company’s estimate of the recoverability of its trade receivables could be impacted. Accounts receivable balances are written off against the allowance for credit losses after all means of internal collection activities have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. The Company uses third-party collection services to continue to seek collection for its written off accounts receivable.
The Company estimates credit losses expected over the life of its trade receivables based on historical information combined with current conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay and reasonable and supportable forecasts. While the Company uses various credit quality metrics, it primarily monitors collectability by reviewing the duration of collection pursuits on its delinquent trade receivables. Based on the Company’s experience, the customer’s delinquency status is the strongest indicator of the credit quality of the underlying trade receivables, which is analyzed monthly.

Lessor Accounting
The Company is a lessor for leases of owned dark fiber acquired in connection with the Transaction, that have contract terms that are accounted for as operating leases. These transactions are generally structured as indefeasible - right - of use agreements (“IRUs”), 
Page 66 of 96

Table of Contents
that are the exclusive right to use specified fibers for a specified term, typically 
20
 - 
25 years
. Cash consideration received on transfers of dark fiber, including upfront installation fees, is recognized on a straight - line basis to service revenue over the term of the agreement. Lease income is included in service revenue in the consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income.
Leases
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, 
Leases
 (“ASU 2016-02”). ASU 2016-02 replaced most existing lease accounting guidance. The Company has elected to apply certain practical expedients under ASU 2016-02, including not separating lease and non-lease components on its finance and operating leases, not reassessing whether any existing contracts contained leases, not reconsidering lease classification, not reassessing initial direct costs and using hindsight in determining the reasonably certain term of its leases.

Finance leases—fiber lease agreements
The Company has entered into lease agreements with numerous providers of dark fiber under IRUs. These IRUs typically have initial terms of 
15
-
20 years
 and include renewal options after the initial lease term. The Company establishes the number of renewal option periods used in determining the lease term based upon its assessment at the inception of the lease of the number of option periods for which failure to renew the lease imposes a penalty in such amount that renewal appears to be reasonably certain. The option to renew may be automatic, at the option of the Company or mutually agreed to between the dark fiber provider and the Company. Once the Company has accepted the related fiber route, leases that meet the criteria for treatment as finance leases are recorded as a finance lease obligation and an IRU asset. The interest rate used in determining the present value of the aggregate future minimum lease payments is the Company’s incremental borrowing rate for the reasonably certain lease term. The determination of the Company’s incremental borrowing rate requires some judgment. Finance lease assets are included in property and equipment in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had committed to additional dark fiber IRU lease agreements totaling $
184.3
 million in future payments to be paid over periods of up to 
20 years
. These obligations begin when the related fiber is accepted, which is generally expected to occur in the next 12 months.
Operating leases
The Company leases office space, rights-of-way, dark fiber and certain data center facilities under operating leases. Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments under the lease. Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the reasonably certain lease term. The implicit rates within the Company’s operating leases are generally not determinable, and the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date to determine the present value of its lease payments. The determination of the Company’s incremental borrowing rate requires some judgment. The Company determines its incremental borrowing rate for each lease using its current borrowing rate, adjusted for various factors including level of collateralization and term to align with the term of the lease. Certain of the Company’s leases include options to extend or terminate the lease. The Company establishes the number of renewal option periods used in determining the 
Page 67 of 96

Table of Contents
operating lease term based upon its assessment at the inception of the operating lease of the number of option periods for which failure to renew the lease imposes a penalty in such amount that renewal appears to be reasonably certain. The option to renew may be automatic, at the option of the Company or mutually agreed to between the landlord, dark fiber provider or the right-of-way provider and the Company. Once the Company has accepted the related fiber route or the facility lease term has begun, the present value of the aggregate future minimum operating lease payments is recorded as an operating lease liability and a right-of-use leased asset. Lease incentives and deferred rent liabilities for facilities operating leases are presented with, and netted against, the right-of-use leased asset. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
The future minimum payments under these operating lease and finance lease agreements are as follows (in thousands):

IRU finance lease termination – discount and gain on lease termination
In June 2024, the Company elected to exercise a contractual option to prepay in full at a 
12.0
%
 discounted rate an IRU finance lease agreement (the “IRU Lease”) for 
$
114.6
 million acquired with the Sprint Business. At the payment date, the present value of the IRU finance lease liability was 
$
117.9
 million and the remaining 
31
 monthly principal payments of 
$
4.2
 million each totaled 
$
130.2
 million. The prepayment resulted in a gain on lease termination of 
$
3.3
 million related to the difference between the book value of 
$
117.9
 million and the cash payment of 
$
114.6
 million. The Company is continuing to use the related IRU asset.
Revenue recognition
The Company recognizes revenue under ASU No. 2014-09, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 (“ASC 606”), which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. Under ASC 606 installation fees for contracts with terms longer than month-to-month are recognized over the contract term. The Company believes that the installation fee does not give rise to a material right as defined by ASC 606 for contracts with terms longer than month-to-month. The Company recognizes revenue over the estimated average customer life for installation fees associated with month-to-month contracts, because the installation fee represents a material right as defined by ASC 606. The Company capitalizes certain contract acquisition costs that relate directly to a customer contract, including commissions paid to its sales team and sales agents and amortizes these costs on a straight-line basis over the period the services are transferred to the customer for commissions paid to its sales team (estimated customer life) and over the remaining original contract term for agent commissions. Management assesses these costs for impairment at least quarterly and as “triggering” events occur that indicate it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. These contract costs were $
31.9
 million as of December 31, 2024 and $
24.3
 million as of December 31, 2023 and are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets (current portion) and deposits and other assets (non - current portion) on the consolidated balance sheets.
The Company’s service offerings consist of on-net and off-net telecommunications services. Fixed fees are billed monthly in advance, and usage fees are billed monthly in arrears. Amounts billed are due upon receipt and contract lengths range from month to month to 
60 months
. The Company satisfies its performance obligations to provide services to customers over time as the services are rendered. In accordance with ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains the promised service. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for these services. The Company has adopted the practical expedient related to certain performance obligation disclosures since it has a right to consideration from its customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Company’s performance completed to date.
Page 68 of 96

Table of Contents
To achieve this core principle, the Company follows the following five steps:
1)
Identification of the contract, or contracts with a customer;
2)
Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;
3)
Determination of the transaction price;
4)
Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
5)
Recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation.
Fees billed in connection with customer installations are deferred (as deferred revenue) and recognized as noted above. To the extent a customer contract is terminated prior to its contractual end, the customer is subject to termination fees. The Company vigorously seeks payment of termination fees. The Company recognizes revenue for termination fees as they are collected. Service revenue recognized from amounts in deferred revenue (contract liabilities) at the beginning of the period during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $
6.5
 million, $
4.9
 million and $
5.0
 million, respectively. Amortization expense for contract costs for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $
20.6
 million, $
19.3
 million and $
19.4
 million, respectively and are included within selling, general, and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
Gross receipts taxes, universal service fund and other surcharges
Revenue recognition standards include guidance relating to taxes or surcharges assessed by a governmental authority that are directly imposed on a revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer and may include, but are not limited to, gross receipts taxes, excise taxes, Universal Service Fund fees and certain state regulatory fees. Such charges may be presented gross or net based upon the Company’s accounting policy election. The Company records certain excise taxes and surcharges on a gross basis and includes them in its revenues and costs of network operations. Excise taxes and surcharges billed to customers and recorded on a gross basis (as service revenue and network operations expense) were $
80.4
 million, $
50.2
 million, and $
15.4
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Network operations
Network operations expenses include the costs of personnel and related operating expenses associated with service delivery, network management, and customer support, network facilities costs, fiber and equipment maintenance fees, leased circuit costs, access fees paid to building owners and certain excise taxes and surcharges recorded on a gross basis. The Company estimates its accruals for any disputed leased circuit obligations based upon the nature and age of the dispute. Network operations costs are impacted by the timing and amounts of disputed circuit costs. The Company generally records these disputed amounts when billed by the vendor and reverses these amounts when the vendor credit has been received or the dispute has otherwise been resolved. The Company does not allocate depreciation and amortization expense to its network operations expense.
Foreign currency translation adjustment and comprehensive income
The consolidated financial statements of the Company’s non-US operations are translated into US dollars using the period-end foreign currency exchange rates for assets and liabilities and the average foreign currency exchange rates for revenues and expenses. Gains and losses on translation of the accounts are accumulated and reported as a component of other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity. The Company’s only components of “other comprehensive income” are currency translation adjustments for all periods presented. The Company considers the majority of its investments in its foreign subsidiaries to be long-term in nature. The Company’s foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) are included within interest income and other on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
Financial instruments
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at purchase to be cash equivalents. The Company determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and evaluates such designation at each balance sheet date.

At December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, prepaid and other current assets, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximated fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments.

22.3
 million as of December 31, 2024 and $
38.7
 million at December 31, 2023. Additional restricted cash related to the IPv4 Notes, as discussed in Note 4, was $
7.1
 million as of December 31, 2024. Additional cash may be further restricted to maintain the Company’s Swap Agreement as interest rates fluctuate and margin requirements change and under the provisions of the Company’s IPv4 Note Indenture, as defined below. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Concentrations of credit risk
The Company’s assets that are exposed to credit risk consist of its cash and cash equivalents, other assets and accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s cash equivalents were invested in demand deposit accounts, overnight investments and money market funds. The Company places its cash equivalents in instruments that meet high-quality credit standards as specified in the Company’s investment policy guidelines. Accounts receivable are due from customers located in major metropolitan areas in the United States, Europe, Canada, Mexico, South America, Oceania and Africa. Receivables from the Company’s net-centric (wholesale) customers are generally subject to a higher degree of credit risk than the Company’s corporate and enterprise customers.
The Company relies upon a limited number of equipment vendors for the majority of its network equipment and is also dependent upon many third-party fiber providers for providing its services to its customers.
Property and equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated once deployed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Useful lives are determined based on historical usage with consideration given to technological changes and trends in the industry that could impact the asset utilization. System infrastructure costs include the capitalized compensation costs of employees directly involved with construction activities and costs incurred by third-party contractors.
Assets and liabilities under finance leases are recorded at the lesser of the present value of the aggregate future minimum lease payments or the fair value of the assets under lease. Leasehold improvements include costs associated with building improvements and customer installation costs. The Company determines the number of renewal option periods, if any, included in the lease term for purposes of amortizing leasehold improvements and the lease term of its finance leases based upon its assessment at the inception of the lease for which the failure to renew the lease imposes a penalty on the Company in such amount that a renewal appears to be reasonably assured. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.

Change in estimated useful life - owned fiber
In accordance with its policy, the Company reviews the estimated useful lives of its fixed assets on an ongoing basis. This review indicated that the actual lives of owned fiber acquired as part of the acquisition of the Sprint Business were longer than the estimated useful lives used for depreciation purposes in the Company’s financial statements. As a result, effective July 1, 2024, the Company changed its estimates of the useful lives of its owned fiber to better reflect the estimated periods during which these assets will remain in service. The estimated useful lives of the owned fiber, within system infrastructure, that previously averaged 
14 
years were increased to an average of 
40 years
. The effect of this change in estimate on the year ended December 31, 2024 was to reduce depreciation expense by 
$
8.7
 million, increase net income by 
$
6.5
 million, and increase basic and diluted earnings per share by 
$
0.14
.
Long-lived assets
The Company’s long-lived assets include property and equipment and intangible assets. Long-lived assets with finite-lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairment is determined by comparing the carrying value of these long-lived assets to management’s probability weighted estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets. In the event an impairment exists, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset, which would be determined by using quoted market prices or valuation techniques such as the discounted present value of expected future cash flows, appraisals, or other pricing models. In the event there are changes in the planned use of the Company’s long-term assets or the Company’s expected future undiscounted cash flows are reduced significantly, the Company’s assessment of its ability to recover the carrying value of these assets could change.
Equity-based compensation
The Company recognizes compensation expense for its share-based payments granted to its employees based on their grant date fair values with the expense being recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company begins recording equity-based compensation expense related to performance awards when it is considered probable that the performance conditions will be met and for market-based awards compensation cost is recognized if the service condition is satisfied even if the market condition is not satisfied. Equity-based compensation expense is recognized in the statements of comprehensive income in a manner consistent with the classification of the employees’ salaries and other compensation. 
Income taxes
The Company’s deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based upon the differences between financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate. Deferred income tax expenses or benefits are based upon the changes in the assets or liability from period to period. At each balance sheet date, the Company assesses the likelihood that it will be able to realize its deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances are established when management determines that it is “more likely than not” that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset may not be realized. The Company considers all available positive and negative evidence in assessing the need for a valuation allowance including its historical operating results, ongoing tax planning, and forecasts of future taxable income, on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. The Company reduces its valuation allowance if the Company concludes that it is “more likely than not” that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets.
Management determines whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position. Once it is determined that a position meets this recognition threshold, the position is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements. The Company adjusts its estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions

periodically because of ongoing examinations by, and settlements with, the various taxing authorities, as well as changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations. The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of its income tax expense.
Basic and diluted net (loss) income per common share
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) excludes dilution for common stock equivalents and is computed by dividing net income or (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period, adjusted for the effect of dilutive common stock equivalents. Shares of restricted stock are included in the computation of basic EPS as they vest and are included in diluted EPS, to the extent they are dilutive, determined using the treasury stock method.

450.0
 million aggregate principal amount of 2027 Notes, $
500.0
 million aggregate principal amount of 2026 Notes and $
206.0
 million aggregate principal amount of IPv4 Notes.
The IPv4 Notes were issued in May 2024 and bear interest at a rate of 
7.924
%, with an anticipated term ending in May 2029 (such anticipated repayment date, the “ARD”). Interest on the IPv4 Notes is paid monthly. The 2027 Mirror Notes were issued in June 2024, are due on June 15, 2027, and bear interest at a rate of 
7.00
% per year. The 2027 Notes were issued in June 2022, are due on June 15, 2027, and bear interest at a rate of 
7.00
% per year. Interest on the 2027 Mirror Notes and 2027 Notes is paid semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The 2026 Notes were issued in May 2021, are due on May 1, 2026, and bear interest at a rate of 
3.50

4.375
% per year. Interest on the 2024 Notes was paid semi-annually on June 30 and December 30 of each year.
Issuance of $
300.0
 Million Principal Amount of 2027 Mirror Notes
On June 11, 2024, Group and Cogent Finance, Inc. (the “Co-Issuer” and, together with Group, the “Issuers”), two wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company, completed an offering of $
300.0
 million aggregate principal amount of its 2027 Mirror Notes for issuance in a private placement not registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The 2027 Mirror Notes were offered and sold only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in an unregistered offering pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to certain non-U.S. persons in transactions outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. The 2027 Mirror Notes have the same maturity date and call protection, bear interest at the same rate and otherwise have substantially the same terms as the 2027 Notes; however, the 2027 Mirror Notes are not fungible (from a trading or tax perspective) with the 2027 Notes and are a separate series of notes from the 2027 Notes.
​
Page 73 of 96

Table of Contents
The 2027 Mirror Notes were issued at a price equal to 
98.50
% of their face value. The net proceeds from the offering were approximately $
291.9
 million after deducting the discount and offering expenses. Group used $
114.6
 million of the net proceeds from the offering to exercise a contractual option to prepay in full the IRU Lease noted above, at a discount. Group expects to use the remainder of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes and/or to make special or recurring dividends to the Company.
The 2027 Mirror Notes were issued pursuant to, and are governed by, an indenture, dated June 11, 2024 (the “2027 Mirror Notes Indenture”), among the Issuers, the Company, the other guarantors named therein and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the “2027 Notes Trustee”). The 2027 Mirror Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed (the “Guarantees”) on a senior unsecured basis by each of Group’s existing and future material domestic subsidiaries (other than the Co-Issuer), subject to certain exceptions (collectively, the “Subsidiary Guarantors”), and by the Company (together with the Subsidiary Guarantors, the “Guarantors”). However, the Company is not subject to the covenants under the 2027 Mirror Notes Indenture. Under certain circumstances, the Guarantors may be released from these Guarantees without the consent of the holders of the 2027 Mirror Notes.
The 2027 Mirror Notes and the Guarantees are the Issuers’ and the Guarantors’ senior unsecured obligations. The 2027 Mirror Notes and the Guarantees are effectively subordinated to all of the Issuers’ and the Guarantors’ existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness, and are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of subsidiaries that are not Subsidiary Guarantors. Without giving effect to collateral arrangements, the 2027 Mirror Notes and the Guarantees rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Issuers’ and the Guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness, including the Issuers’ 2026 Notes and the 2027 Notes. The 2027 Mirror Notes and the Guarantees rank contractually senior in right of payment to all of the Issuers’ and the Guarantors’ subordinated indebtedness and are structurally subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of the Issuers’ non-guarantor subsidiaries.
After June 15, 2024, the Issuers may redeem the 2027 Mirror Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price ranging from 
103.5
% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Mirror Notes redeemed to par (depending on the year), in each case, as set forth in the 2027 Mirror Notes Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of redemption.
If Group undergoes specific kinds of change in control accompanied by certain ratings events, the Issuers will be required to offer to repurchase the 2027 Mirror Notes from holders at a price equal to 
101
% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of repurchase. Additionally, if Group or any of its restricted subsidiaries sells assets and does not apply the proceeds from such sale in a certain manner or certain other events have not occurred, under certain circumstances, the Issuers will be required to use the net proceeds to make an offer to purchase the 2027 Mirror Notes at an offer price in cash equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the 2027 Mirror Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the repurchase date. In connection with any offer to purchase all or any of the 2027 Mirror Notes (including a change of control offer, asset sale offer or any tender offer), if holders of no less than 
90
% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 2027 Mirror Notes validly tender their 2027 Mirror Notes, the Issuers or a third party are entitled to redeem any remaining 2027 Mirror Notes at the price paid to each holder.
The 2027 Mirror Notes Indenture includes covenants that restrict Group and its restricted subsidiaries’ (including the Co-Issuer’s) ability to, among other things; incur indebtedness; issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities; pay dividends or make other distributions in respect of, or repurchase or redeem, capital stock; make certain investments and other restricted payments, such as prepayment, redemption or repurchase of certain indebtedness; create liens; consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of Group and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole; incur restrictions on the ability of a subsidiary to pay dividends or make other payments; or enter into transactions with affiliates. The covenants provide for certain exceptions to these restrictions, and the Company is not subject to the covenants under the 2027 Mirror Notes Indenture. Certain covenants will cease to apply to the 2027 Mirror Notes if, and for so long as, the 2027 Mirror Notes have investment grade ratings from any two of Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Fitch Ratings, Inc. and S&P Global Ratings and so long as no default or event of default under the 2027 Mirror Notes Indenture has occurred and is continuing. Upon suspension of the covenants, the Guarantees will be released until such time as the covenants are no longer suspended. 
The principal amount of the 2027 Mirror Notes would become immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy or insolvency events involving Group, the Co-Issuer or certain of Group’s subsidiaries, and may be declared immediately due and payable by the 2027 Notes Trustee or the holders of at least 
25
% of the aggregate principal amount of the then-outstanding 2027 Mirror Notes upon the occurrence of certain events of default under the 2027 Mirror Notes Indenture. Events of default include the following with respect to the Issuers and Group’s significant subsidiaries: (i) failure to pay principal, premium or interest at required times; (ii) failure to comply with any other agreements in the 2027 Mirror Notes Indenture; (iii) default on certain material indebtedness that is caused by a failure to make a payment within any applicable grace period when due at maturity or results in the acceleration of such indebtedness prior to its express maturity; (iv) failure to pay certain material judgments; (v) a Guarantee being 
Page 74 of 96

held unenforceable or invalid or ceasing for any reason to be in full force and effect or a Guarantor denying or disaffirming its obligations under its Guarantee; and (vi) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency.
Issuance of $
206.0
 Million Principal Amount of IPv4 Notes
On May 2, 2024, Cogent IPv4 LLC (the “IPv4 Issuer”), a special-purpose, bankruptcy remote, indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, issued $
206.0
 million principal amount of its IPv4 Notes in an offering exempt from registration under the Securities Act. The net proceeds from the offering, after debt offering costs, were $
198.4
 million and are expected to be used for general corporate purposes.
The IPv4 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of May 2, 2024 (the “IPv4 Base Indenture”), as supplemented by the Series 2024-1 Supplement thereto, dated as of May 2, 2024 (the “Series 2024-1 Supplement”), in each case entered into by and between the IPv4 Issuer and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as the trustee for the IPv4 Notes (the “IPv4 Trustee”). The IPv4 Base Indenture allows the IPv4 Issuer to issue additional series of notes subject to certain conditions set forth therein, and the IPv4 Base Indenture, together with the Series 2024-1 Supplement, and any other series supplements to the IPv4 Base Indenture, is referred to herein as the “IPv4 Indenture.”
The IPv4 Notes were issued as part of a securitization transaction, pursuant to which certain IPv4 addresses, customer IPv4 address leases, customer accounts receivable and other IPv4 address assets (collectively, “IPv4 Address Assets”) were contributed to the IPv4 Issuer and are included as collateral for the IPv4 Notes.
While the IPv4 Notes are outstanding, scheduled payments of interest are required to be made on a monthly basis. From and after the ARD, principal payments will also be required to be made on the IPv4 Notes on a monthly basis. No principal payments will be due on the IPv4 Notes prior to the ARD, unless certain rapid amortization or acceleration triggers are activated.
Cogent Communications LLC (in such capacity, the “Manager”) performs certain monthly services related to the IPv4 Address Assets and IPv4 Notes including billing customers, collecting amounts paid by customers, forwarding payments to the IPv4 Trustee related to the IPv4 Address Assets and other administrative services. Amounts paid by the Manager to the IPv4 Trustee are reconciled on a monthly basis and the IPv4 Trustee pays the monthly interest on the IPv4 Notes and other expenses from the accumulated customer payments on the IPv4 Address Assets. Amounts held by the IPv4 Trustee before the monthly reconciliation is completed are considered restricted cash. After the IPv4 Trustee pays the monthly interest and other IPv4 Address Asset related costs, including monthly fees paid to the Manager for its services, the residual cash is paid to the Company and is unrestricted.
The legal final maturity date of the IPv4 Notes is in 
May of 2054
. If the IPv4 Issuer has not repaid or refinanced the IPv4 Notes prior to the monthly payment date in May of 2029, additional interest will accrue thereon in an amount equal to the greater of (i) 
5.0
% per annum and (ii) the excess amount, if any, by which the sum of the following exceeds the interest rate for such IPv4 Note: (A) the yield to maturity (adjusted to a “mortgage-equivalent basis” pursuant to the standards and practices of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association) on the ARD for such IPv4 Note of the United States Treasury Security having a remaining term closest to 10 years; plus (B) 
5.0
%; plus (C) the post-ARD note spread of 
3.400
% applicable to such IPv4 Note.
The IPv4 Notes are obligations only of the IPv4 Issuer pursuant to the indenture (the IPv4 Indenture”), and are secured by a security interest in substantially all of the IPv4 Address Assets pursuant to the IPv4 Indenture. The IPv4 Notes are guaranteed by Cogent IPv4 Holdco LLC, a special-purpose entity and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, as the guarantor (in such capacity, the “IPv4 Guarantor”), pursuant to a guaranty, dated as of May 2, 2024 (the “Guaranty”) by the IPv4 Guarantor in favor of the IPv4 Trustee pursuant to which the IPv4 Guarantor has granted a security interest in the equity interests of the IPv4 Issuer as collateral security for its obligations under the Guaranty. Except as described below, neither the Company nor any subsidiary of the Company, other than the IPv4 Issuer and the IPv4 Guarantor, will guarantee or in any way be liable for the obligations of the IPv4 Issuer under the IPv4 Indenture or the IPv4 Notes.
The IPv4 Notes are subject to a series of covenants and restrictions customary for transactions of this type. These covenants and restrictions include (i) that the IPv4 Issuer maintains a liquidity reserve account to be used to make required payments in respect of the IPv4 Notes with such funds considered restricted cash; (ii) provisions relating to optional and mandatory prepayments, including specified make-whole payments in the case of certain optional prepayments of the IPv4 Notes prior to the monthly payment date in May of 2028; (iii) certain indemnification payments in the event, among other things, that the transfers of the assets pledged as collateral for the IPv4 Notes are in stated ways defective or ineffective; and (iv) covenants relating to recordkeeping, access to information and similar matters. As provided in the IPv4 Base Indenture, the IPv4 Notes are also subject to rapid amortization in the event of a failure to maintain a stated debt service coverage ratio as defined in the IPv4 Indenture. A rapid amortization may be cured 
Page 75 of 96

Table of Contents
if the debt service coverage ratio exceeds a certain threshold for a certain period of time, upon which cure, regular amortization, if any, will resume. In addition, if certain utilization thresholds are not met (i.e., the proportion of IP addresses which are leased to the total number of IP addresses owned by the IPv4 Issuer falls below certain thresholds), the IPv4 Issuer will be required to apply collections to the repayment of the IPv4 Notes, and in certain circumstances, the noteholders will have the ability to direct a sale of the IP Address Assets, in whole or in part, pursuant to the terms set forth in the IPv4 Indenture. The IPv4 Notes are also subject to certain customary events of default, including events relating to non-payment of required interest, principal or other amounts due on or with respect to the IPv4 Notes, failure to comply with covenants within certain time frames, certain bankruptcy events, breaches of specified representations and warranties, failure of security interests to be effective and certain judgments.
Issuance of the 2027 Notes and Redemption of 2024 Notes
On June 22, 2022 (the “2027 Notes Closing Date”), Group completed its offering of $
450.0
 million aggregate principal amount of its 2027 Notes for issuance in a private placement not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The 2027 Notes were offered and sold only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in an unregistered offering pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to certain non-U.S. persons in transactions outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. The 2027 Notes were issued pursuant to, and are governed by, an indenture (the “2027 Notes Indenture”), dated the 2027 Notes Closing Date by and among Group, Holdings, the other guarantors named therein and the trustee. The 2027 Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of the Company’s existing and future material domestic subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions, and by the Company. Under certain circumstances, the Guarantors may be released from these Guarantees without the consent of the holders of the 2027 Notes.
The net proceeds from the 2027 Notes offering were $
446.0
 million after deducting the $
2.7
 million discount and $
1.3
 million of offering expenses. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the 2027 Notes offering to redeem its 2024 Notes. The Company expects to use the remaining net proceeds from the 2027 Notes offering for general corporate purposes, and/or to repurchase the Company’s common stock or for special or recurring dividends to the Company’s stockholders. In connection with full redemption of its 2024 Notes, Group issued a conditional notice of full redemption to holders of the 2024 Notes, specifying June 30, 2022 as the redemption date (the “Redemption Date”). On the 2027 Notes Closing Date, Group satisfied and discharged its obligations under the 2024 Notes by depositing with a designee of the trustee for the 2024 Notes sufficient funds to pay the principal of the Premium (defined below) and accrued and unpaid interest on the Euro Notes to the Redemption Date. The 2024 Notes were issued in Euros and were reported in the Company’s reporting currency, US dollars, until they were extinguished and redeemed. Prior to the redemption of the 2024 Notes, the gain on foreign exchange on the 2024 Notes from converting Euros into US dollars was $
31.6
 million for 2022.
Unless earlier redeemed or repurchased, the 2027 Notes will mature on June 15, 2027. After June 15, 2024, Group may redeem the 2027 Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price ranging from 
103.5
% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Notes redeemed to par (depending on the year), in each case, as set forth in the 2027 Notes Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.
On the Redemption Date, Group redeemed its €
350.0
 million of 2024 Notes at a price of 
101.094
% (€
353.8
 million or $
375.2
 million) of the principal amount (the “Premium”) plus €
7.7
 million ($
8.1
 million) of interest paid through June 30, 2022, the Redemption Date where the Premium reduced to 
101.094
%, for a total payment of €
361.5
 million ($
383.4
 million). Group entered into a short-term USD to Euro forward purchase agreement to mitigate the risk of foreign currency fluctuations. As a result of these transactions, the Company incurred a loss on debt extinguishment and redemption of $
11.9
 million. On the Redemption Date the 2024 Notes were valued at $
365.8
 million, resulting in a gain on foreign exchange of $
31.6
 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Issuance of the 2026 Notes
On May 7, 2021 (the “2026 Notes Closing Date”), Group completed an offering of $
500.0
 million aggregate principal amount of its 2026 Notes for issuance in a private placement exempt from registration under the Securities Act. The 2026 Notes were offered and sold only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to certain non-U.S. persons in transactions outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. The 2026 Notes were issued pursuant to, and are governed by, an indenture (the “2026 Notes Indenture”), dated the 2026 Notes Closing Date by and among Group, Holdings, the other guarantors named therein, the trustee and the collateral agent. The 2026 Notes are guaranteed on a senior secured basis, jointly and severally, by Group’s material domestic subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions (the “Subsidiary Guarantors”). In addition, the 2026 Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Holdings (together with the Subsidiary Guarantors, the “Guarantors”). Under certain circumstances, the Guarantors may be released from these guarantees without the consent of the holders of the 2026 Notes. The net proceeds from the 2026 Notes offering were $
496.9
 million after deducting the $
1.8
 million discount and $
1.3
 million of offering expenses.

 million 2024 Notes
In June 2019, Group completed an offering of €
135.0
 million of 2024 Notes. The net proceeds from the June 2019 offering, after deducting offering expenses, were $
152.1
 million. In June 2020, Group completed an offering of €
215.0
 million of 2024 Notes. The net proceeds from the June 2020 offering, after deducting offering expenses, were $
240.3
 million. The 2024 Notes were guaranteed (the “Guarantees”) on a senior unsecured basis, jointly and severally, by the Company’s material domestic subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions, and by the Company (collectively, the “Guarantors”). Under certain circumstances, the Guarantors could be released from these Guarantees without the consent of the holders of the 2024 Notes. 
The 2024 Notes bore interest at a rate of 
4.375
% per annum and was paid semi-annually in arrears on June 30 and December 30 of each year. The 2024 Notes were scheduled to mature on June 30, 2024. The 2024 Notes were issued in Euros and were reported in the Company’s reporting currency — US dollars. As of December 31, 2022, the 2024 Notes were valued at $
397.0
 million, resulting in a gain on foreign exchange of $
32.5
 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.
In June 2022, Group redeemed the 2024 Notes, as noted above.
Limitations Under the Indentures
The indentures governing the 2026 Notes, the 2027 Notes and the 2027 Mirror Notes (the “Indentures”), among other things, limit the ability of Group and its restricted subsidiaries to incur indebtedness; to pay dividends or make other distributions; to make certain investments and other restricted payments; to create liens; to consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets; to incur restrictions on the ability of a subsidiary to pay dividends or make other payments; and to enter into certain transactions with its affiliates. There are certain exceptions to the limitations on the ability to incur indebtedness under the Indentures, including IRU agreements incurred in the normal course of business and any additional indebtedness if Group’s consolidated leverage ratio, as defined in the Indentures, is less than 
6.0
 to 
1.0
 or Group’s fixed charge coverage ratio, as defined in the Indentures, is 
2.0
 to 
1.0
 or greater. Group and its subsidiaries can also incur unlimited liens (which can be used, together with capacity under the debt covenant, to incur additional secured indebtedness) if Group’s consolidated secured leverage ratio, as defined in the Indentures, 
is
 less 
than

4.0
 to 
1.0
. Under the Indentures, Group and its restricted subsidiaries can pay dividends, make other distributions, make certain investments and make other restricted payments under certain circumstances, including if, after giving pro forma effect to such restricted payment, Group could still incur $
1
 of “Ratio Debt,”, as defined (i.e., either its consolidated leverage ratio is less than 
6.0
 to 
1.0
 or its fixed charge coverage ratio is 
2.0
 to 
1.0
 or greater). As of December 31, 2024, Group’s consolidated leverage ratio was below 
6.0
, Group’s consolidated secured leverage ratio was below 
4.0
 and Group’s fixed charge coverage ratio was above 
2.0

Interest Rate Swap Agreement
As of December 31, 2024, the Company was party to the Swap Agreement that has the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest rate obligation associated with its 2026 Notes to a variable interest rate obligation based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) so that the interest payable on the 2026 Notes effectively became variable based on overnight SOFR. The critical 
Page 77 of 96

Table of Contents
terms of the Swap Agreement match the terms of the 2026 Notes, including the notional amount and the optional redemption date on February 1, 2026. The Company did not elect hedge accounting for the Swap Agreement. The Swap Agreement is recorded at its fair value at each reporting period, and the Company incurs gains and losses due to changes in market interest rates. By entering into the Swap Agreement, the Company has assumed the risk associated with variable interest rates. Changes in interest rates affect the valuation of the Swap Agreement that the Company recognizes in its consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The values that the Company reports for the Swap Agreement as of each reporting date are recognized as “interest expense including change in valuation – interest rate swap agreement” with the corresponding amounts included in assets or liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
As of December 31, 2024, the fair value of the Swap Agreement was a net liability of $
22.3
 million, of which $
18.3
 million is presented with accrued and other current liabilities and $
4.0
 million is presented with other long-term liabilities. As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of the Swap Agreement was a net liability of $
38.7
 million, of which $
21.6
 million is presented with accrued and other current liabilities and $
17.1
 million is presented with other long-term liabilities. Unrealized gains (losses) related to the Swap Agreement are included in interest expense. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has made a $
23.4
 million deposit with the counterparty to the Swap Agreement. If the fair value of the Swap Agreement exceeds a net liability of $
23.4
 million, the Company will be required to deposit additional funds with the counterparty equal to the net liability fair value. As of December 31, 2024, $
22.3
 million of the deposit was restricted and $
1.1
 million was unrestricted.
Under the Swap Agreement, the Company pays the counterparty a semi-annual payment based upon overnight 
SOFR
 plus a contractual interest rate spread, and the counterparty pays the Company a semi-annual fixed 
3.50
% interest payment. The settlement payment is made each November and May until the Swap Agreement expires in February 2026. Under the settlements paid in May and November 2024, the Company paid a total of $
24.2
 million to the counterparty for a net cash interest cost of $
24.2
 million. Under the settlements paid in May and November 2023, the Company paid a total of $
21.5
 million to the counterparty for a net cash interest cost of $
21.5
 million. Under the settlements paid in May and November 2022, the Company paid a total of $
2.1
 million to the counterparty for a net cash interest cost of $
2.1
 million.

The acquisition of Sprint was an asset acquisition for US federal income tax purposes. The Company recorded a net, deferred tax liability of $
475
 million, that represents the difference in book basis and tax basis of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Seller indemnified the Company for historical tax exposures and the estimated indemnification asset is not material.
At each balance sheet date, the Company assesses the likelihood that it will be able to realize its deferred tax assets. The Company considers all available positive and negative evidence in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. The Company maintains a full valuation allowance against certain of its deferred tax assets consisting primarily of net operating loss carryforwards related to its foreign operations in Europe, South America, Oceania and Africa.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company has combined net operating loss carry-forwards of $
1.0
 billion. This amount includes federal net operating loss carry-forwards in the United States of $
27.4
 million, net operating loss carry-forwards related to its European operations of $
956.9
 million and $
35.6
 million related to its other international operations. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code in the United States limits the utilization of net operating losses when ownership changes, as defined by that section, occur. The Company has performed an analysis of its Section 382 ownership changes and has determined that the utilization of certain of its net operating loss carryforwards in the United States is limited based on the annual Section 382 limitation and remaining carryforward period. Of the net operating losses available at December 31, 2024 in the United States $
12.8
 million are limited for use under Section 382. Net operating loss carryforwards outside of the United States totaling $
992.5
 million are not subject to limitations similar to Section 382. There are $
12.8
 million of net operating loss carryforwards in the United States that will expire, if unused, in 2025. The net operating loss carry-forwards related to the Company’s European operations include $
828.0
 million that do not expire and $
128.8
 million that expire between 2025 and 2038.
The Company has not provided for United States deferred income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on its undistributed earnings for certain non-US subsidiaries earnings or cumulative translation adjustments because these earnings and adjustments are intended to be permanently reinvested in operations outside the United States. It is not practical to determine the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability on such undistributed earnings or cumulative translation adjustments.
In the normal course of business, the Company takes positions on its tax returns that may be challenged by taxing authorities. The Company evaluates all uncertain tax positions to assess whether the position will more likely than not be sustained upon examination. If the Company determines that the tax position is not more likely than not to be sustained, the Company records a liability for the amount of the benefit that is not more likely than not to be realized when the tax position is settled. The Company did not have a material liability for uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, and does not expect that its liability for uncertain tax positions will materially increase during the year ended December 31, 2025; however, actual changes in the liability for uncertain tax positions could be different than currently expected. If recognized, changes in the Company’s total unrecognized tax benefits would impact the Company’s effective income tax rate.

6. Commitments and contingencies:
Current and potential litigation
In accordance with the accounting guidance for contingencies, the Company accrues its estimate of a contingent liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and there is a range of expected loss for which no amount in the range is more likely than any other amount, the Company accrues at the low end of the range. The Company reviews its accruals at least quarterly and adjusts them to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. The Company has taken certain positions related to its obligations for leased circuits for which it is reasonably possible to result in a loss of up to $
4.3
 million in excess of the amount accrued at December 31, 2024.
In the ordinary course of business, the Company is involved in other legal activities and claims. Because such matters are subject to many uncertainties and the outcomes are not predictable with assurance, the liability related to these legal actions and claims cannot be determined with certainty. Management does not believe that such claims and actions will have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. Judgment is required in estimating the ultimate outcome of any dispute resolution process, as well as any other amounts that may be incurred to conclude the negotiations or settle any litigation. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, and such differences could be material.

184.3
 million in future payments to be paid over periods of up to 
20 years
. These obligations begin when the related fiber is accepted, which is generally expected to occur in 2025. Future minimum payments under these dark fiber IRU obligations are $

​
7. Stockholders’ equity:
Authorized shares
The Company has 
75.0
 million shares of authorized $
0.001
 par value common stock and 
10,000
 authorized but unissued shares of $
0.001
 par value preferred stock. The holders of common stock are entitled to 
one
 vote per common share and, subject to any rights of any series of preferred stock, dividends may be declared and paid on the common stock when determined by the Company’s Board of Directors.
Common stock buybacks
The Company’s Board of Directors has approved $
50.0
 million for purchases of the Company’s common stock under a buyback program (the “Buyback Program”) through 2025. At December 31, 2024, there was $
22.4
 million remaining for purchases under the Buyback Program. In June 2024, the Company purchased 
153,322
 shares of its common stock for $
8.0
 million at an average share price of $
51.97
. There were 
no
 purchases of common stock in 2023 or 2022.
Dividends on common stock
Dividends are recorded as a reduction to retained earnings. Dividends on unvested restricted shares of common stock are paid as the awards vest. The payment of any future dividends and any other returns of capital, including stock buybacks, will be at the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors and may be reduced, eliminated or increased and will be dependent upon the Company’s financial position, results of operations, available cash, cash flow, capital requirements, limitations under the Company’s debt indentures and other factors deemed relevant by the Company’s Board of Directors. The Company is a Delaware corporation and under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware distributions may be restricted including a restriction that distributions, including stock purchases and dividends, do not result in an impairment of a corporation’s capital, as defined under Delaware law. The Indentures limit the Company’s ability to return cash to its stockholders.
8. Stock option and award plan:
Incentive award plan
The Company grants restricted stock and options for common stock under its award plan, as amended (the “Award Plan”). Stock options granted under the Award Plan generally vest over a 
four-year
 period and have a term of 
ten years
. Grants of shares of restricted stock granted under the Award Plan generally vest over periods ranging from 
three
 to 
four years
. Compensation expense for all awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period. Awards with graded vesting terms that are subject only to service conditions are recognized on a straight-line basis. Certain option and share grants provide for accelerated vesting if there is a change in control, as defined. For grants of restricted stock, when an employee terminates prior to full vesting the employee retains their vested shares, and the employees’ unvested shares are returned to the Award Plan. For grants of options for common stock, when an employee terminates prior to full vesting, the employee may elect to exercise their vested options for a period of 
ninety days
, and any unvested options are returned to the Award Plan. Shares issued to satisfy awards are provided from the Company’s authorized shares. The vesting of certain shares granted to the Company’s executives is subject to certain performance conditions determined by the Company’s Board of Directors. The vesting of certain shares granted to the Company’s CEO is subject to the total shareholder return of the Company’s common stock compared to the total shareholder return of the Nasdaq Telecommunications Index, the 
Page 81 of 96

Table of Contents
Company’s growth rate in revenue, the Company’s growth rate in cash flow from operating activities,and the Company’s growth rate in earnings before interest and depreciation, as adjusted, with each portion of the CEO’s performance-based equity award subject to a cap and no shares earned if performance with respect to a target is less than zero.
The accounting for equity-based compensation expense requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect its financial statements. These estimates for stock options include the following:
Expected Dividend Yield—The Company uses an expected dividend yield based upon expected annual dividends and the Company’s stock price.
Expected Volatility—The Company uses its historical volatility for a period commensurate with the expected term of the option.
Risk-Free Interest Rate—The Company uses the zero-coupon US Treasury rate during the quarter having a term that most closely resembles the expected term of the option.
Expected Term of the Option—The Company estimates the expected life of the option term by analyzing historical stock option exercises.
Forfeiture Rates—The Company estimates its forfeiture rate based on historical data with further consideration given to the class of employees to whom the options or shares were granted.
The weighted-average per share grant date fair value of options was $
12.95
 in 2024, $
12.81
 in 2023 and $
10.73
 in 2022. The following assumptions were used for determining the fair value of options granted in the three years ended December 31, 2024:

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
None.
ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
As required by SEC Rule 13a-15(b), an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL
OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
We are responsible for the preparation and integrity of our published financial statements. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and, accordingly, include amounts based on judgments and estimates made by our management. We also prepared the other information included in the annual report and are responsible for its accuracy and consistency with the financial statements.
We are responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of internal control over financial reporting, which is intended to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the reliability of our financial statements. The system includes but is not limited to:
●
a documented organizational structure and division of responsibility;
●
established policies and procedures, including a code of conduct to foster a strong ethical climate which is communicated throughout the company;
●
regular reviews of our financial statements by qualified individuals; and
●
the careful selection, training and development of our people.
There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Also, the effectiveness of an internal control system may change over time. We have implemented a system of internal control that was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
As required by Rule 13a-15(d) of the Exchange Act, we have assessed our internal control system in relation to criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in “Internal Control—Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework). Based upon these criteria, we believe that, as of December 31, 2024, our system of internal control over financial reporting was effective.
The independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has audited our 2024 financial statements. Ernst & Young LLP was given unrestricted access to all financial records and related data, including minutes of all meetings of stockholders, the Board of Directors and committees of the Board. Ernst & Young LLP has issued an unqualified report on our 2024 financial statements as a result of the audit and also has issued an unqualified report on our internal control over financial reporting which is attached hereto.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc., and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control— Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc., and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2 and our report dated February 28, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
