GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS
Company Overview
Reflecting the evolution and growth of our company, Lancaster Colony Corporation changed its name to The Marzetti Company effective June 27, 2025. Since the divestiture of our last non-food businesses in 2014, Lancaster Colony Corporation operated as a food-only business best-known by our customers, licensing partners, suppliers, and employees as Marzetti. While Lancaster Colony Corporation will always be an important part of our heritage, changing our company name to The Marzetti Company provides a single brand identity for our business across all stakeholders. As The Marzetti Company, we are positioned for further growth in today’s food industry with an authentic brand name rooted in quality, innovation and collaboration.
The Marzetti Company, an Ohio corporation, is a manufacturer and marketer of specialty food products for the retail and foodservice channels. Our principal executive offices are located at 380 Polaris Parkway, Suite 400, Westerville, Ohio 43082 and our telephone number is 614-224-7141.
Our vision is to be 
The Better Food Company

To Nourish Growth With All That We Do
.
Our company goals are to bring delicious food to the table and to deliver top quartile financial performance and top quartile product quality, safety and customer satisfaction while attracting, retaining and rewarding top quartile people. To achieve these goals, we are focused on the three pillars of our strategic growth plan:
1.
Accelerate our base business growth;
2.
Simplify our supply chain to reduce our costs and grow our margins; and
3.
Expand our core business with our Retail licensing program and complementary mergers and acquisitions

The vast majority of the products we sell in the Retail segment are sold through sales personnel, food brokers and distributors in the United States. We have products typically marketed in the shelf-stable section of the grocery store, which include licensed sauces and dressings, along with our own branded salad dressings and croutons. Within the frozen food section of the grocery store, we sell yeast rolls and garlic breads. We also have placement of products in grocery produce departments through our refrigerated salad dressings, licensed dressings, vegetable dips and fruit dips.
Our top five Retail customers accounted for 62%, 59% and 59% of this segment’s total net sales in 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
We continue to rely upon our strong retail brands, innovation expertise, geographic and channel expansion and customer relationships for future growth. Our category-leading retail brands and commitment to new product development help drive increased consumer demand in our Retail segment. We have also expanded Retail segment growth by leveraging our strong Foodservice customer relationships to establish exclusive licensing agreements for the retail channel. Strategic acquisitions are also part of our future growth plans, with a focus on fit and value.
Our quarterly Retail sales are affected by seasonal fluctuations, primarily in the fiscal second quarter and the Easter holiday season when sales of certain frozen retail products tend to be most pronounced. Our quarterly Retail sales can also be affected by the timing of seasonal shipments of certain fruit dips between the first and second quarters. The resulting impacts on working capital are not significant. In addition to the owned and licensed trademarked brands discussed above, we also own and operate under innumerable other intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, formulas, proprietary trade secrets, technologies, know-how processes and other unregistered rights. We consider our owned and licensed intellectual property rights to be essential to our Retail business.
Foodservice Segment
The majority of our Foodservice sales are products sold under private label to national chain restaurant accounts. We also manufacture and sell various branded Foodservice products to distributors.
The following table presents the primary Foodservice products we manufacture and sell under our brand names:

The vast majority of the products we sell in the Foodservice segment are sold through sales personnel, food brokers and distributors in the United States. Most of the products we sell in the Foodservice segment are custom-formulated sauces, salad dressings, frozen breads and yeast rolls. Finally, within this segment, for a period of up to twelve months commencing in March 2025, we are manufacturing and selling certain salad dressing and sauce products under a temporary supply agreement (“TSA”) resulting from the Atlanta plant acquisition.
Our top five Foodservice direct customers accounted for 53%, 53% and 58% of this segment’s total net sales in 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Within our Foodservice segment, typically our largest direct customers are distributors that distribute our products primarily to foodservice national chain restaurant accounts.
In the Foodservice segment, sales growth results from general volume gains or geographic expansion of our established customer base, and we also grow our business with existing and new customers by leveraging our culinary skills and experience to support the development of new products and menu offerings. Strategic acquisitions may also contribute to the future growth of the Foodservice segment, with a focus on fit and value.
The operations of this segment are not affected to any material extent by seasonal fluctuations. We own and operate under innumerable intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, formulas, proprietary trade secrets, technologies, know-how processes and other unregistered rights. We consider our owned intellectual property rights to be essential to our Foodservice business.
NET SALES ATTRIBUTED TO SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS
Net sales attributed to Walmart Inc. (“Walmart”) totaled 19%, 18% and 18% of consolidated net sales for 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Our relationship with Chick-fil-A, Inc. (“Chick-fil-A”), one of our national chain restaurant accounts, also represents a significant portion of our consolidated net sales. In Foodservice, we primarily supply Chick-fil-A indirectly through multiple distributors with the remainder supplied directly to Chick-fil-A. Chick-fil-A is also a significant contributor to our Retail sales as we sell their sauce and dressing products into the retail channel through an exclusive license agreement. Total net sales attributed to Chick-fil-A, including the Retail sales resulting from the exclusive license agreement and the Foodservice sales, totaled 29%, 28% and 26% of consolidated net sales for 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

MANUFACTURING
As of June 30, 2025, the majority of our products were manufactured and packaged at our 14 food plants located throughout the United States. Most of these plants produce products for both the Retail and Foodservice segments. Efficient and cost-effective production remains a key focus as evidenced by our cost savings initiatives. Certain items are also manufactured and packaged by third parties located in the United States, Canada and Europe.
COMPETITION
All of the markets in which we sell food products are highly competitive in the areas of price, quality and customer service. We face competition from a number of manufacturers of various sizes and capabilities. Our ability to compete depends upon a variety of factors, including the position of our branded goods within various categories, product quality, product innovation, promotional and marketing activity, pricing and our ability to service customers.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION
Our business operations are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local government entities and agencies. As a producer of food products for human consumption, our operations are subject to stringent production, packaging, quality, labeling and distribution standards, including regulations promulgated under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Food Safety Modernization Act. We are also subject to various federal, state and local environmental protection laws. Based upon available information, compliance with these laws and regulations did not have a material effect upon the level of capital expenditures, earnings or our competitive position in 2025 and is not expected to have a material impact in 2026.
HUMAN CAPITAL
As of June 30, 2025, we had 3,700 employees. Of those employees, 18% are represented under various ongoing collective bargaining contracts and 5% are represented under a collective bargaining contract that will expire within one year.
Our people are essential to our vision to be 
The Better Food Company 
— the industry leader in creating great tasting food and cultivating deep and lasting relationships with customers and consumers. The honesty, integrity and sound judgment of our people in following our Code of Conduct are what enable us to be successful and fulfill our company’s purpose 
To Nourish Growth With All That We Do
.
Consistent with this purpose, our human capital management strategy emphasizes six key areas of focus: Health and Safety; Talent Acquisition; Total Rewards; Employee Engagement; Respect and Belonging; and Community Engagement. Our Board of Directors oversees this strategy and dedicates one Board meeting each year to a full review of talent.
Health and Safety
The health and well-being of our employees is paramount to the success of our business, and we are proud to be leaders in our industry with respect to our safety record and safety initiatives. Our approach to occupational health and safety centers around three elements: training, response, and tracking. We maintain a rigorous safety training program that ensures employees throughout the organization are regularly trained in every aspect of workplace safety. Management personnel with direct responsibility for safety oversight also receive comprehensive professional training and the opportunity for certification.
Talent Acquisition
Our ability to attract, retain, and develop top talent is integral to our long-term success and sustainability. Our commitment to creating an environment that fosters growth, innovation, and excellence ensures that we remain well-positioned to meet both current and future business demands. We employ a strategic, inclusive approach to talent acquisition, which emphasizes the identification and recruitment of individuals whose skills, values, and expertise align with our corporate vision of becoming 
The Better Food Company
. In order to drive our business forward, we focus on recruiting resilient, adaptable problem solvers who demonstrate the agility required to navigate an evolving industry landscape. Additionally, we seek empowered innovators who are motivated to push boundaries and engage in continuous learning, as well as collaborative team players who contribute to the strength of our organizational culture. 
Through ongoing investments in learning, development, and leadership programs, we ensure that our workforce is equipped with the tools necessary to thrive in their roles. This commitment to professional development enables employees to pursue meaningful career paths while contributing to the achievement of our strategic objectives.
Total Rewards
We offer our employees competitive fixed and/or variable pay along with a Total Rewards package which typically includes medical, prescription, dental, vision and life insurance benefits, paid parental leave, adoption assistance, disability coverage, a 401(k) plan, and various employee assistance programs. We review external benchmarking annually to ensure our compensation and benefits offerings remain competitive.
In addition to our foundational compensation and benefits offerings, we continue to expand our Total Rewards program to strengthen our focus on work/life effectiveness and holistic well-being, which includes physical, financial, emotional, and social well-being. We genuinely want to help our people to thrive both personally and professionally and have cultivated a high-performing workplace built on trust, accountability and growth.
Employee Engagement
To keep our employees engaged and fulfilled in their roles, we have sought to establish a continuous feedback loop between our employees and company leadership. We communicate consistently with our people via a range of channels, including town hall meetings, regular updates, and key announcements. Each year, we invite our employees to respond to our annual employee engagement survey and share their views on a range of workplace questions. Based on feedback from the survey, management develops and implements plans to address the primary areas of opportunity that have been identified by employees.

Respect and Belonging
We foster a collaborative work environment where all employees can thrive and feel a sense of respect and belonging. We honor the dignity of every individual, believing that this commitment enhances our ability to attract and retain a high-performing team. Our talent management strategy includes programs to support well-being, measure performance, encourage professional development, encourage belonging, and provide technical and leadership training to grow individual and team capability. We measure the experiences of our employees to identify areas for improvement and assess the effectiveness of our efforts. Our goal is to continuously develop a workplace where respect and belonging define our culture.
Community Engagement
Our volunteering and philanthropic efforts focus on reducing poverty and food insecurity while promoting good health and quality education for all. In 2025, our teams mobilized to support Pelotonia, Ronald McDonald House Charities, and Bonzy Charities. We regularly donate funds and volunteer time to a range of other community organizations and foundations as well, including the Children’s Hunger Alliance, National Veterans Memorial and Museum, Jobs for America’s Graduates, and local food banks.
RAW MATERIALS
During 2025, we obtained adequate supplies of raw materials and packaging. We rely on a variety of raw materials and packaging for the day-to-day production of our products, including soybean oil, various sweeteners, eggs, dairy-related products, flour, various films and plastic and paper packaging materials.
We purchase the majority of these materials on the open market to meet current requirements, but we also have some fixed-price contracts with terms generally one year or less. See further discussion in the “Risk Factors” section below and the “Financial Condition” section of our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”). Although the availability and price of certain of these materials are influenced by weather, disease and the level of global demand, we anticipate that future sources of supply for 2026 will generally be available and adequate for our needs.
