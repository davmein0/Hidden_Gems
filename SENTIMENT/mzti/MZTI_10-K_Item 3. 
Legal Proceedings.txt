Item 3. 
Legal Proceedings
From time to time we are a party to various legal proceedings. While we believe that the ultimate outcome of these various proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements, litigation is always subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. An unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products or could lead to us altering the manner in which we manufacture or sell one or more products, which could have a material impact on net income for the period in which the ruling occurs and future periods.
We are required to disclose certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that we reasonably believe will be in excess of an applied threshold not to exceed $1 million. We are using a threshold of $1 million as we believe this amount is reasonably designed to result in disclosure of such proceedings that are material to our business or financial condition. Applying this threshold, there are no environmental matters to disclose in this Form 10-K.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Our fiscal year begins on July 1 and ends on June 30. Unless otherwise noted, references to “year” pertain to our fiscal year; for example, 2025 refers to fiscal 2025, which is the period from July 1, 2024 to June 30, 2025.
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The forward-looking statements in this section and other parts of this report involve risks, uncertainties and other factors, including statements regarding our plans, objectives, goals, strategies, and financial performance. Our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of factors set forth under the caption “Forward-Looking Statements” and those set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our discussion of results for 2025 compared to 2024 is included herein. For discussion of results for 2024 compared to 2023, see our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
OVERVIEW
Business Overview
The Marzetti Company is a manufacturer and marketer of specialty food products for the retail and foodservice channels.
Our financial results are presented as two reportable segments: Retail and Foodservice. Costs that are directly attributable to either Retail or Foodservice are charged directly to the appropriate segment. Costs that are deemed to be indirect, excluding corporate expenses and other unusual significant transactions, are allocated to the two reportable segments using a reasonable methodology that is consistently applied.
Over 95% of our products are sold in the United States. Foreign operations and export sales have not been significant in the past and are not expected to be significant in the future based upon existing operations. We do not have any fixed assets located outside of the United States.
Our business has the potential to achieve future growth in sales and profitability due to attributes such as:
•
leading Retail market positions in several product categories with a high-quality perception;
•
recognized innovation in Retail products;
•
a broad customer base in both Retail and Foodservice accounts;
•
well-regarded culinary expertise among Foodservice customers;
•
long-standing Foodservice customer relationships that help to support strategic licensing opportunities in Retail;
•
demonstrated success with strategic licensing programs in Retail through both new and established relationships in the foodservice industry;
•
recognized leadership in Foodservice product development;
•
experience in integrating complementary business acquisitions; and
•
historically strong cash flow generation that supports growth opportunities.
Our goal is to grow both Retail and Foodservice segment sales over time by:
•
introducing new products and expanding distribution;
•
leveraging the strength of our Retail brands to increase current product sales; 
•
expanding Retail growth through strategic licensing agreements;
•
continuing to rely upon the strength of our reputation in Foodservice product development and quality; and
•
acquiring complementary businesses.
With respect to long-term growth, we continually evaluate the future opportunities and needs for our business specific to our plant infrastructure, IT platforms and other initiatives to support and strengthen our operations. Recent examples of resulting investments include:
•
the acquisition of a sauce and dressing production facility in the Atlanta, Georgia area in February 2025;
•
a significant capacity expansion project for our Marzetti dressing and sauce facility in Horse Cave, Kentucky that was fully operational beginning in March 2023; and
•
our enterprise resource planning system (“ERP”) project and related initiatives, Project Ascent, that reached completion of the implementation phase in August 2023.
Project Ascent entailed the replacement of our primary customer and manufacturing transactional systems, warehousing systems, and financial systems with an integrated SAP S/4HANA system. Implementation of this system began in July 2022 and continued throughout fiscal 2023. Customer fulfillment levels remained strong before and after the initial system cutover with no unplanned disruptions in receiving orders, producing products or shipping orders. During fiscal 2023, we progressed through our ERP implementation with no major disruptions. We completed the final wave of the implementation phase in August 2023 as planned and have shifted our focus towards leveraging the capabilities of our new ERP system.

Net Sales
Consolidated net sales for the year ended June 30, 2025 increased 2.0% to a new record of $1,909.1 million from the prior-year record total of $1,871.8 million, reflecting higher net sales for both the Retail and Foodservice segments driven primarily by increased volume and mix. Year-over-year comparisons for the Retail segment were unfavorably impacted by prior-year sales attributed to the perimeter-of-the-store bakery product lines we exited in March 2024. Year-over-year comparisons for the Foodservice segment were favorably impacted by a temporary supply agreement (“TSA”) resulting from our acquisition of a sauce and dressing production facility located in Atlanta, Georgia (“Atlanta plant”). The acquisition was completed in February 2025. The TSA commenced in March 2025 for a period of up to 12 months. Breaking down the 2.0% increase in consolidated net sales as summarized in the table below, higher core volumes and product mix contributed approximately 220 basis points, as partially offset by approximately 90 basis points attributed to the exited perimeter-of-the-store bakery product lines. The incremental sales attributed to the TSA accounted for 80 basis points.

Table of Contents
Gross Profit
Consolidated gross profit increased 5.4% to $455.6 million in 2025 compared to $432.3 million in 2024 driven by the positive impacts of our cost savings programs, volume growth and some modest cost deflation.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses increased 5.6% to $230.2 million in 2025 compared to $218.1 million in 2024. This increase includes investments in IT to support the continued growth of our business and $3.8 million in incremental expenditures attributed to the Atlanta plant acquisition, as partially offset by prior-year expenses for Project Ascent. The incremental acquisition-related expenditures were primarily comprised of legal and professional fees.
Expenses attributed to Project Ascent, our ERP initiative, were included within Corporate Expenses and classified separately through 2024. A portion of the costs classified as Project Ascent expenses represent ongoing costs that have continued subsequent to the completion of our ERP implementation in 2024. Beginning in 2025, these ongoing costs are no longer classified separately as Project Ascent expenses.
Restructuring and Impairment Charges
In 2025, we committed to a plan to close our sauce and dressing production facility in Milpitas, California as part of our ongoing strategic initiative to better optimize our manufacturing network. Production at the facility is expected to conclude in the quarter ending September 30, 2025. In 2025, we recorded restructuring and impairment charges of $4.5 million related to this closure. These charges consisted of impairment charges for personal property and operating lease right-of-use assets, one-time termination benefits, and other closing costs. The operations of this facility were not classified as discontinued operations as the closure did not represent a strategic shift that would have a major effect on our operations or financial results.
In 2025, we transitioned our internal transportation fleet operation to an external dedicated carrier. In 2025, we recorded resulting restructuring charges of $0.6 million for one-time termination benefits.
In 2024, we committed to a plan to exit our perimeter-of-the-store bakery product lines and close our Flatout flatbread facility in Saline, Michigan and our Angelic Bakehouse sprouted grain bakery facility in Cudahy, Wisconsin. Production at these facilities ceased in March 2024, and we completed the divestiture of the real estate and manufacturing equipment at these locations during the quarter ended June 30, 2024. The operations of these facilities were not classified as discontinued operations as the closures did not represent a strategic shift that would have a major effect on our operations or financial results. In 2024, we recorded restructuring and impairment charges of $14.9 million related to these closures, as well as $2.6 million recorded in Cost of Sales for the write-down of inventories. The restructuring and impairment charges, which consisted of impairment charges for fixed assets and intangible assets, one-time termination benefits and other closing costs, were not allocated to our two reportable segments due to their unusual nature whereas the $2.6 million write-down of inventories was recorded in our Retail segment.
Operating Income
Operating income increased 10.5% to $220.3 million in 2025 compared to $199.4 million in 2024 due to the increase in gross profit and lower restructuring and impairment charges, as partially offset by the higher SG&A expenses.
The following table presents a reconciliation between operating income as reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and adjusted operating income, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted operating income excludes certain items affecting comparability that can impact the analysis of our underlying core business performance and trends. Management uses this non-GAAP measure in preparation of our annual operating plan and for our monthly analysis of operating results. The excluded items consist of costs related to restructuring or acquisition activities.

Pension Settlement Charge
Prior to November 30, 2024, we sponsored multiple defined benefit pension plans that covered certain former employees under collective bargaining contracts related to closed or sold operations. All these plans were previously frozen. In August 2024, our Board of Directors approved the merger of all five pension plans and the termination of the resulting merged plan. The merged plan was terminated effective November 30, 2024. Lump sum distributions and annuity purchases from a highly rated insurance company were completed in December 2024. As a result of the pension termination, we incurred a one-time noncash settlement charge of $14.0 million in 2025. See further discussion in Note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
Other, Net
Other, net resulted in a benefit of $7.1 million in 2025 compared to a benefit of $6.2 million in 2024. This change primarily reflects higher interest income.
Taxes Based on Income
Our effective tax rate was 21.6% and 22.8% in 2025 and 2024, respectively. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of the statutory rate to the effective rate.
Earnings Per Share
As influenced by the factors discussed above, diluted net income per share totaled $6.07 in 2025, an increase from the 2024 total of $5.76 per diluted share. Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for each of the years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024 have remained relatively stable.
In 2025, the pension settlement charge reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.39, restructuring and impairment charges reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.15 and costs related to the Atlanta plant acquisition reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.11. 
In 2024, costs related to our decision to exit our perimeter-of-the-store bakery product lines reduced diluted earnings per share by a total of $0.49. These exit costs included restructuring and impairment charges, which reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.42, and the inventory write-down, which reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.07. In 2024, expenditures for Project Ascent reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.23.

In 2025, net sales for the Retail segment reached a record $1,003.4 million, a 1.5% increase from the prior-year total of $988.4 million, reflecting higher sales volumes. Year-over-year comparisons for the Retail segment were unfavorably impacted by prior-year sales attributed to the perimeter-of-the-store bakery product lines we exited in March 2024. Excluding the exited product lines, Retail net sales increased 3.3%. Retail segment net sales growth was driven by our licensing program led by Texas Roadhouse

 frozen garlic bread also added to the growth in Retail net sales. Retail segment sales volumes, measured in pounds shipped, increased 1.6%. Excluding the impact of all sales attributed to the exited perimeter-of-the-store bakery product lines, Retail sales volumes increased 2.9%.
In 2025, Retail segment operating income increased $4.0 million, or 1.9%, to $211.7 million due to the higher sales volume and more favorable sales mix, our cost savings programs and some modest cost deflation, as partially offset by higher sales and marketing costs as we invested to support the growth of our brands.

In 2025, Foodservice segment net sales increased 2.5% to a record $905.7 million from the 2024 total of $883.3 million driven by increased demand from several of our national chain restaurant account customers and growth for our Marzetti
®
 branded Foodservice products. In the back half of the fiscal year, Foodservice segment net sales were unfavorably impacted by menu changes implemented by two of our national chain restaurant customers as they shifted their focus to value offerings. Excluding all sales attributed to the TSA resulting from the February 2025 Atlanta plant acquisition, Foodservice segment net sales increased 0.9%. Foodservice segment sales volumes, measured in pounds shipped, increased 0.9%. Excluding all TSA sales, Foodservice segment sales volumes declined 0.3%.
In 2025, Foodservice segment operating income increased 14.9% to $111.6 million driven by the beneficial impact of our cost savings programs and cost deflation, as partially offset by higher supply chain costs.
Corporate Expenses
In 2025, corporate expenses totaled $97.9 million as compared to $90.5 million in 2024. This increase primarily reflects investments in IT to support the continued growth of our business and $3.8 million in incremental expenditures attributed to the Atlanta plant acquisition, as partially offset by prior-year expenses for Project Ascent.
LOOKING FORWARD
For 2026, we anticipate Retail segment sales will continue to benefit from volume growth, with contributions from both our licensing program and our Marzetti
®
, New York Bakery
TM
, and Sister Schubert’s
®
 brands. In the Foodservice segment, we expect sales to be supported by select quick-service restaurant customers in our mix of national chain restaurant accounts, while external factors, including U.S. economic performance and consumer behavior, may impact demand. With respect to our input costs, in aggregate we anticipate a modest level of inflation in fiscal 2026 that we plan to offset through contractual pricing and our cost savings programs as we remain focused on continued margin improvement in the year ahead.
We also look forward to further incorporating our newly acquired Atlanta-based sauce and dressing plant into our manufacturing network.
While the current tariff environment entails some uncertainty, based on our understanding of currently available information for existing and proposed tariffs, we do not anticipate the performance of our business will be materially impacted by tariffs.
On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBBA”). In accordance with GAAP, the effects of changes in tax laws or rates are recognized in the period in which the legislation is enacted. We expect the OBBBA to primarily provide cash tax timing benefits with no material impact on our effective tax rate.
We will continue to periodically reassess our allocation of capital to ensure that we maintain adequate operating flexibility while providing appropriate levels of cash returns to our shareholders.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We maintain sufficient flexibility in our capital structure to ensure our capitalization is adequate to support our future internal growth prospects, acquire food businesses consistent with our strategic goals, and maintain cash returns to our shareholders through cash dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. Our balance sheet maintained fundamental financial strength during 2025 as we ended the year with $161 million in cash and equivalents, along with shareholders’ equity of $998 million and no debt.
Under our unsecured revolving credit facility (“Facility”), we may borrow up to a maximum of $150 million at any one time. We had no borrowings outstanding under the Facility at June 30, 2025. At June 30, 2025, we had $2.6 million of standby letters of credit outstanding, which reduced the amount available for borrowing under the Facility. The Facility expires in March 2029, and all outstanding amounts are then due and payable. Interest is variable based upon formulas tied to SOFR or an alternate base rate defined in the Facility. We must also pay facility fees that are tied to our then-applicable consolidated leverage ratio. Loans may be used for general corporate purposes. Due to the nature of its terms, when we have outstanding borrowings under the Facility, they will be classified as long-term debt.
26
Table of Contents
The Facility contains certain restrictive covenants, including limitations on liens, asset sales and acquisitions, and financial covenants relating to interest coverage and leverage. At June 30, 2025, we were in compliance with all applicable provisions and covenants of this facility, and we exceeded the requirements of the financial covenants by substantial margins. At June 30, 2025, there were no events that would constitute a default under this facility.
We currently expect to remain in compliance with the Facility’s covenants for the foreseeable future. However, a default under the Facility could accelerate the repayment of any then outstanding indebtedness and limit our access to $75 million of additional credit available under the Facility. Such an event could require a reduction in or curtailment of cash dividends or share repurchases, reduce or delay beneficial expansion or investment plans, or otherwise impact our ability to meet our obligations when due.
We believe that cash provided by operating activities and our existing balances in cash and equivalents, in addition to that available under the Facility, should be adequate to meet our liquidity needs over the next 12 months, including the projected levels of capital expenditures and dividend payments. If we were to borrow outside of the Facility under current market terms, our average interest rate may increase and have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Based on our current plans and expectations, we believe our capital expenditures for 2026 could total between $75 and $85 million.
Beyond the next 12 months, we expect that cash provided by operating activities will be the primary source of liquidity. This source, combined with our existing balances in cash and equivalents and amounts available under the Facility, is expected to be sufficient to meet our overall cash requirements.
We have various contractual and other obligations that are appropriately recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements, including finance lease obligations, operating lease obligations, other post-employment benefit obligations, tax liabilities, noncurrent workers compensation obligations, deferred compensation and interest on deferred compensation. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our lease obligations, including the maturities of minimum lease payments. It is not certain when the liabilities for other post-employment benefit obligations, tax liabilities, noncurrent workers compensation obligations, deferred compensation and interest on deferred compensation will become due. See Notes 8 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about these liabilities.
Certain other contractual obligations are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Examples of such obligations are commitments to purchase raw materials or packaging inventory that has not yet been received as of June 30, 2025, as well as purchase orders and longer-term purchase arrangements related to the procurement of services, including IT service agreements, and property, plant and equipment. The majority of these obligations is expected to be due within one year.

Cash provided by operating activities and our existing balances in cash and equivalents remain the primary sources for funding our investing and financing activities, as well as financing our organic growth initiatives.
Cash provided by operating activities in 2025 totaled $261.5 million, an increase of 4.0% as compared with the 2024 total of $251.6 million. The 2025 increase was primarily due to higher net income, the current-year noncash pension settlement charge and higher noncash depreciation and amortization expense, as partially offset by unfavorable year-over-year changes in net working capital and lower noncash restructuring and impairment charges. The unfavorable net working capital changes reflected the impact of a prior-year decline in accounts receivable and a prior-year increase in accounts payable, partially offset by a prior-year increase in inventories.
Cash used in investing activities totaled $148.2 million in 2025 as compared to $67.4 million in 2024. The 2025 increase primarily reflects the $78.8 million of cash paid for the February 2025 Atlanta plant acquisition, as well as prior-year proceeds from the sale of property totaling $7.0 million. Payments for property additions were $9.6 million lower in the current year.
Financing activities used net cash totaling $115.3 million and $109.2 million in 2025 and 2024, respectively. The vast majority of the cash used in financing activities is attributed to the payment of dividends, and the 2025 increase in cash used in financing activities primarily reflects higher levels of dividend payments. The regular dividend payout rate for 2025 was $3.75 per share, as compared to $3.55 per share in 2024. This past fiscal year marked the 62
nd
 consecutive year of increased regular cash dividends.
27
Table of Contents
Future levels of share repurchases and declared dividends are subject to the periodic review of our Board of Directors and are generally determined after an assessment is made of various factors, such as anticipated earnings levels, cash flow requirements and general business conditions.
Our ongoing business activities continue to be subject to compliance with various laws, rules and regulations as may be issued and enforced by various federal, state and local agencies. With respect to environmental matters, costs are incurred pertaining to regulatory compliance and, upon occasion, remediation. Such costs have not been, and are not anticipated to become, material.
We are contingently liable with respect to lawsuits, taxes and various other matters that routinely arise in the normal course of business. We do not have any related party transactions that materially affect our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.
IMPACT OF INFLATION
Our business results can be influenced by significant changes in the costs of our raw materials, packaging and freight. We attempt to mitigate the impact of inflation on our raw-material costs via longer-term fixed-price contractual commitments for a portion of our most significant market-indexed commodities, most notably soybean oil and flour. Specific to freight costs, our transportation network includes a mix of dedicated carriers and longer-term fixed-rate contracts. We also have a transportation management system in place to support our freight management processes and help us to secure more competitive freight rates. Nonetheless, we are subject to events and trends in the marketplace that will impact our costs for raw materials, packaging and freight. While we attempt to pass through sustained increases in these costs, any such price adjustments can lag the changes in the related input costs.
Although typically less notable, we are also exposed to the unfavorable effects of general inflation beyond material and freight costs, especially in the areas of labor rates, including annual wage adjustments and benefit costs. Over time, we attempt to minimize the exposure to such cost increases through ongoing improvements and greater efficiencies throughout our manufacturing operations, including benefits gained through our cost savings programs and strategic investments in plant equipment.
With regard to the impact of commodity and freight costs on Foodservice segment operating income, most of our supply contracts with national chain restaurant accounts incorporate pricing adjustments to account for changes in ingredient and freight costs. These supply contracts may vary by account specific to the time lapse between the actual change in ingredient and freight costs we incur and the effective date of the associated price increase or decrease. As a result, the reported operating margins of the Foodservice segment are subject to increased volatility during periods of rapidly rising or falling ingredient and/or freight costs because at least some portion of the change in ingredient and/or freight costs is reflected in the segment’s results prior to the impact of any associated change in pricing. In addition, the Foodservice segment has an inherently higher degree of margin volatility from changes in ingredient costs when compared to the Retail segment due to its overall lower margin profile and higher ratio of ingredient pounds to net sales. In Retail, there is an opportunity to offset the impact of inflationary costs through net price realization actions including list price increases, decreased trade spending and packaging size changes. Note that all these Retail cost-recovery options entail some inherent risks and uncertainties, and the implementation timeframe can lag the input cost changes. We also implement value engineering initiatives, such as the use of lower-cost packaging materials and alternative ingredients and/or recipes, to reduce Retail and Foodservice product costs to help offset inflation.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
This MD&A discusses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including, but not limited to, those related to accounts receivable allowances, distribution costs, asset impairments and self-insurance reserves. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Historically, the aggregate differences, if any, between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. While a summary of our significant accounting policies can be found in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect those areas in which more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
28
Table of Contents
Trade-Related Allowances
Our receivables balance is net of trade-related allowances, which consist of sales discounts, trade promotions and certain other sales incentives. We evaluate the adequacy of these allowances considering several factors including historical experience, specific trade programs and existing customer relationships. These allowances can fluctuate based on the level of sales and promotional programs as well as the timing of deductions.
Goodwill
Goodwill is not amortized. It is evaluated annually at April 30 by applying impairment testing procedures. We evaluate the future economic benefit of the recorded goodwill when events or circumstances indicate potential recoverability concerns. Carrying amounts are adjusted appropriately when determined to have been impaired.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Recent accounting pronouncements and their impact on our consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
We desire to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “PSLRA”). This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains various “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the PSLRA and other applicable securities laws. Such statements can be identified by the use of the forward-looking words “anticipate,” “estimate,” “project,” “believe,” “intend,” “plan,” “expect,” “hope” or similar words. These statements discuss future expectations; contain projections regarding future developments, operations or financial conditions; or state other forward-looking information. Such statements are based upon assumptions and assessments made by us in light of our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors we believe to be appropriate. These forward-looking statements involve various important risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ as a result of factors over which we have no, or limited, control including, without limitation, the specific influences outlined below. Management believes these forward-looking statements to be reasonable; however, one should not place undue reliance on such statements that are based on current expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update such forward-looking statements, except as required by law.
Items which could impact these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those risk factors identified in Item 1A and:
•
efficiencies in plant operations and our overall supply chain network;
•
price and product competition;
•
the success and cost of new product development efforts;
•
the lack of market acceptance of new products;
•
changes in demand for our products, which may result from changes in consumer behavior or loss of brand reputation or customer goodwill;
•
the impact of customer store brands on our branded retail volumes;
•
the impact of any laws and regulatory matters affecting our food business, including any additional requirements imposed by the FDA or any state or local government;
•
the extent to which good-fitting business acquisitions are identified, acceptably integrated, and achieve operational and financial performance objectives;
•
inflationary pressures resulting in higher input costs;
•
fluctuations in the cost and availability of ingredients and packaging;
•
adverse changes in freight, energy or other costs of producing, distributing or transporting our products;
•
the reaction of customers or consumers to pricing actions we take to offset inflationary costs;
•
adverse changes in trade policies, including increased tariffs, retaliatory trade measures, or other trade restrictions;
•
dependence on key personnel and changes in key personnel;
•
adequate supply of labor for our manufacturing facilities;
•
stability of labor relations;
•
geopolitical events that could create unforeseen business disruptions and impact the cost or availability of raw materials and energy;
•
dependence on a wide array of critical third parties to support our operations, including contract manufacturers, distributors, logistics providers and IT vendors;
•
cyber-security incidents, information technology disruptions, and data breaches;
•
the potential for loss of larger programs or key customer relationships;

•
certain other risk factors, including those discussed in other filings we have submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Item 7A. 
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We have exposure to market risks primarily from changes in raw material prices. In recent years, due to the absence of any borrowings, we have not had exposure to changes in interest rates. We also have not had exposure to market risk associated with derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments as we do not utilize any such instruments.
RAW MATERIAL PRICE RISK
We purchase a variety of commodities and other raw materials, such as soybean oil, flour, eggs and dairy-based materials, which we use as ingredients for our products. The market prices for these commodities are subject to fluctuation based upon a number of economic factors and may become volatile at times. While we do not use any derivative commodity instruments to hedge against commodity price risk, we do actively manage a portion of the risk through a structured forward purchasing program for certain key materials such as soybean oil and flour. This program, coupled with short-term fixed price arrangements on other significant raw materials, provide us more predictable input costs, which, in addition to the supply contracts with our foodservice customers that allow us to pass along price increases for commodities, help to reduce margin volatility during periods of significant volatility in the commodity markets.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of The Marzetti Company
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Marzetti Company (formerly Lancaster Colony Corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2025, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2025 and 2024 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2025, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated August 21, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Trade-Related Allowances - Refer to Note 1 in the Financial Statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company offers various trade-related allowances to their customers, which consist of sales discounts, trade promotions and certain other sales incentives. These are treated as a reduction to accounts receivable and revenue, generally when the related revenue is recognized. Depending on the specific type of trade-related allowance, the Company uses either the expected value or most likely amount method to determine the reduction to accounts receivable and revenue. The Company evaluates the adequacy of these allowances considering several factors including historical experience, specific trade programs and existing customer relationships.
We identified the trade-related allowances as a critical audit matter because of the complexity and volume of the Company's activities related to trade-related allowances. This required significant audit effort due to the various types of promotional trade programs and information systems utilized to track and record the promotional activities.
31
Table of Contents
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to trade-related allowances included the following, among others:
•
We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of relevant controls over the trade-related allowances, including automated controls within relevant systems.
•
We tested the customer promotional trade programs and related deduction data underlying the trade-related allowances to validate the nature, timing, and amounts accrued as of June 30, 2025.
•
We tested the completeness of the trade-related allowances by performing a retrospective review of selected customer deductions taken after June 30, 2025 and comparing to the Company’s trade-related allowances recorded.
•
We analyzed the trade-related allowances journal entry data to confirm our understanding of the expected relationships with revenues and accounts receivable.

THE MARZETTI COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Tabular amounts in thousands, except per share data)
Note 1 – 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Marzetti Company and our wholly-owned subsidiaries, collectively referred to as “we,” “us,” “our,” “registrant,” or the “Company.” Intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. Our fiscal year begins on July 1 and ends on June 30. Unless otherwise noted, references to “year” pertain to our fiscal year; for example, 2025 refers to fiscal 2025, which is the period from July 1, 2024 to June 30, 2025.
Subsequent Event
On July 8, 2025, we entered into a new lease agreement with an initial term of 15 years for warehousing space in Columbus, Ohio with fixed cash payments totaling approximately $
159
 million. A right-of-use asset and lease liability will be recorded based on the present value of the lease payments when the lease commences in fiscal 2027.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates included in these consolidated financial statements include allowances for customer deductions, net realizable value of inventories, useful lives for the calculation of depreciation and amortization, distribution accruals, pension and postretirement assumptions and self-insurance accruals. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Fair Value
Fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. GAAP sets forth a three-level fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The three levels are as follows:
Level 1 – defined as observable inputs, such as quoted market prices in active markets.
Level 2 – defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable.
Level 3 – defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore, requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.
Our financial assets and liabilities subject to the three-level fair value hierarchy consist principally of cash and equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and defined benefit pension plan assets. The estimated fair value of cash and equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximates their carrying value.
 See Note 11 for fair value disclosures related to our defined benefit pension plan assets. 
Impairment charges for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets resulted from nonrecurring fair value measurements. See further discussion in Note 1.
Cash and Equivalents
We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying amounts of our cash and equivalents approximate fair value due to their short maturities and are considered level 1 investments, which have quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets. As a result of our cash management system, checks issued but not presented to the banks for payment may create negative book cash balances. When such negative balances exist, they are included in Accrued Liabilities.
Receivable Allowances
Our receivables balance is net of trade-related allowances, which consist of sales discounts, trade promotions and certain other sales incentives. We evaluate the adequacy of these allowances considering several factors including historical experience, specific trade programs and existing customer relationships. These allowances can fluctuate based on the level of sales and promotional programs as well as the timing of deductions.
38
Table of Contents
THE MARZETTI COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Tabular amounts in thousands, except per share data)
We also provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our estimate of expected credit losses, which considers the aging of accounts receivable balances, historical write-off experience and on-going reviews of our trade receivables. Measurement of expected credit losses requires credit review of existing customer relationships, consideration of historical loss experience, including the need to adjust for current conditions, and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data, including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates and the economic health of customers.
 Our allowance for doubtful accounts was immaterial for all periods presented.
Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and equivalents and trade accounts receivable. By policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one institution or issuer. We maintain our cash and equivalents with high credit-quality financial institutions. Deposits with these financial institutions may exceed the amounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The majority of our excess cash is invested in AAA-rated money market funds that primarily invest in U.S. government securities. Our concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable is mitigated by our credit evaluation process and our broad Retail and Foodservice customer base.
 However, our accounts receivable balance attributable to Walmart Inc. (“Walmart”) as a percentage of consolidated accounts receivable was 
32
% at June 30, 2025. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated accounts receivable at June 30, 2025.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value and are costed by various methods that approximate actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. Due to the nature of our business, work in process inventory is not a material component of inventory. When necessary, we provide allowances to adjust the carrying value of our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value, including any costs to sell or dispose. The determination of whether inventory items are slow moving, obsolete or in excess of needs requires estimates about the future demand for our products. The estimates as to future demand used in the valuation of inventory are subject to the ongoing success of our products and may differ from actual due to factors such as changes in customer and consumer demand.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, except for those acquired as part of a business combination, which are recorded at fair value at the time of purchase. We use the straight-line method of computing depreciation for financial reporting purposes based on the estimated useful lives of the corresponding assets. Estimated useful lives for buildings and improvements range generally from 
10
 to 
40
 years, machinery and equipment, excluding technology-related equipment, range generally from 
3
 to 
15
 years and technology-related equipment range generally from 
3
 to 
5
 years. For tax purposes, we generally compute depreciation using accelerated methods.

THE MARZETTI COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Tabular amounts in thousands, except per share data)
In 2025, we recorded an impairment charge of $
1.9
 million for certain property, plant and equipment related to our sauce and dressing manufacturing facility located in Milpitas, California. This charge resulted from our plan to close this facility, which triggered impairment testing, and represents the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. The fair value was based on estimated selling prices for the real estate and manufacturing equipment, which represents a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. The impairment charge was reflected in Restructuring and Impairment Charges and was not allocated to our two reportable segments due to its unusual nature.
In 2024, we recorded an impairment charge of $
9.0
 million for certain property, plant and equipment related to Angelic Bakehouse (“Angelic”) and Flatout. This charge resulted from our decision to exit our perimeter-of-the-store bakery product lines, which triggered impairment testing, and represents the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. The fair value was based on actual selling prices for the real estate and manufacturing equipment at the Angelic sprouted grain bakery facility in Cudahy, Wisconsin and the Flatout flatbread facility in Saline, Michigan, which represents a Level 2 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. The impairment charge was reflected in Restructuring and Impairment Charges and was not allocated to our two reportable segments due to its unusual nature.
Deferred Software Costs
We capitalize certain costs related to hosting arrangements that are service contracts (cloud computing arrangements). Capitalized costs are included in Other Current Assets or Other Noncurrent Assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life.
 In 2025 and 2024, we capitalized $
0.6
 million and $
1.0
 million, respectively, of deferred software costs related to cloud computing arrangements.
Long-Lived Assets
We monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of our long-lived assets by periodically considering whether indicators of impairment are present. If such indicators are present, we determine if the assets are recoverable by comparing the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows to the assets’ carrying amounts. Our cash flows are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions. If the carrying amounts are greater, then the assets are not recoverable. In that instance, we compare the carrying amounts to the fair value to determine the amount of the impairment to be recorded.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill is not amortized. It is evaluated annually at April 30, or when events or circumstances indicate potential recoverability concerns, by applying impairment testing procedures. See further discussion regarding goodwill in Note 6.
Other intangible assets, which had a 
zero
 balance at June 30, 2025 and 2024, were amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives to Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.
 Amortization expense for our other intangible assets was $
0.4
 million and $
2.5
 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. We monitored the recoverability of the carrying value of our other intangible assets similar to our long-lived assets discussed above. Carrying amounts were adjusted appropriately when determined to have been impaired.
In 2024, we recorded an impairment charge of $
4.5
 million
 to write off the net carrying value of the intangible assets related to Angelic and Flatout based on our decision to exit our perimeter-of-the-store bakery product lines. The impairment charge was reflected in Restructuring and Impairment Charges and was not allocated to our two reportable segments due to its unusual nature.
In 2023, we recorded impairment charges of $
25.0
 million
 related to Flatout’s intangible assets due to our lowered expectations for the projected sales and profitability of the Flatout product lines. The tradename, customer relationships and technology / know-how intangible assets were written down to their fair values. These impairment charges were reflected in Restructuring and Impairment Charges and were recorded in our Retail segment.
The impairment charges discussed above represent the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of estimated discounted cash flows specific to the remaining useful lives of the related intangible assets. As the fair value measurements were based on significant inputs not observable in the market, they represented Level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy.
Leases
We record right-of-use assets and lease liabilities based on the present value of the lease payments for operating leases and finance leases with an initial term in excess of 12 months. We made an accounting policy election to exclude short-term leases from our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Table of Contents
THE MARZETTI COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Tabular amounts in thousands, except per share data)
In evaluating our contracts to determine whether a contract is or contains a lease, we consider the following:
•
Whether explicitly or implicitly identified assets have been deployed in the contract; and
•
Whether we obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of that underlying asset, and we can direct how and for what purpose the asset is used during the term of the contract.
In determining how to allocate consideration between lease and non-lease components in a contract that was deemed to contain a lease, we use judgment and consistent application of assumptions to reasonably allocate the consideration.
For leases containing options to extend or terminate, we determine whether the extension or termination should be considered reasonably certain to be exercised.
The discount rate for leases, if not explicitly stated in the lease, is the incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. We use a discount rate to calculate the present value of lease liabilities. In the development of the discount rate, we consider our internal borrowing rate, treasury security rates, collateral and credit risk specific to us, and our lease portfolio characteristics.
Accrued Distribution
We incur various freight and other related costs associated with shipping products to our customers and warehouses. We provide accruals for unbilled shipments from carriers utilizing historical or projected freight rates and other relevant information.
Accruals for Self-Insurance
Self-insurance accruals are made for certain claims associated with employee health care, workers’ compensation and general liability insurance up to stop-loss coverage. These accruals include estimates that are primarily based on historical loss development factors.
Shareholders’ Equity
We are authorized to issue 
3,050,000
 shares of preferred stock consisting of 
750,000
 shares of Class A Participating Preferred Stock with $
1.00
 par value, 
1,150,000
 shares of Class B Voting Preferred Stock with 
no
 par value and 
1,150,000
 shares of Class C Nonvoting Preferred Stock with 
no
 par value. Our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase authorization of 
2,000,000
 common shares in November 2010.
 At June 30, 2025, 
1,083,830
 common shares remained authorized for future purchase.
Revenue Recognition
When Performance Obligations Are Satisfied
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account for revenue recognition. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The singular performance obligation of our customer contracts is determined by each individual purchase order and the respective food products ordered, with revenue being recognized at a point-in-time when the obligation under the terms of the agreement is satisfied and product control is transferred to our customer. Specifically, control transfers to our customers when the product is delivered to or picked up by our customers based upon applicable shipping terms, as our customers can direct the use and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the asset at this point in time. The performance obligations in our customer contracts are generally satisfied within 30 days. As such, we have not disclosed the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations as of June 30, 2025.
Significant Payment Terms
In general, within our customer contracts, the purchase order identifies the product, quantity, price, pick-up allowances, payment terms and final delivery terms. Payment terms usually include early pay discounts. We grant payment terms consistent with industry standards. Although some payment terms may be more extended, presently the majority of our payment terms are less than 60 days. As a result, we have used the available practical expedient and, consequently, do not adjust our revenues for the effects of a significant financing component.
Distribution
Distribution fees billed to customers are included in Net Sales. All distribution costs associated with outbound freight are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in Cost of Sales; this includes distribution costs incurred after control over a product has transferred to a customer, as we have chosen to use the available practical expedient to account for these costs within our cost of sales.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Tabular amounts in thousands, except per share data)
Variable Consideration
In addition to fixed contract consideration, our contracts include some form of variable consideration, including sales discounts, returns, trade promotions and certain other sales and consumer incentives, including rebates and coupon redemptions. In general, variable consideration is treated as a reduction in revenue when the related revenue is recognized. Depending on the specific type of variable consideration, we use either the expected value or most likely amount method to determine the variable consideration. We believe there will be no significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration when any related uncertainties are resolved with our customers. We review and update our estimates and related accruals of variable consideration each period based on historical experience and any recent changes in the market.
Warranties & Returns
We provide all customers with a standard or assurance type warranty. Either stated or implied, we provide assurance the related products will comply with all agreed-upon specifications and other warranties provided under the law. No services beyond an assurance warranty are provided to our customers.
We do not grant a general right of return. However, customers may return defective or non-conforming products. Customer remedies may include either a cash refund or an exchange of the product. As a result, the right of return and related refund liability is estimated and recorded as a reduction in revenue. This return estimate is reviewed and updated each period and is based on historical sales and return experience.
Contract Balances
We do not have deferred revenue or unbilled receivable balances and thus do not have any related contract asset and liability balances as of June 30, 2025.
Contract Costs
We have identified sales commissions as an incremental cost incurred to obtain a customer contract. These costs are required to be capitalized under the new revenue recognition standard. We have chosen to use the available practical expedient to continue to expense these costs as incurred as the amortization period for such costs is one year or less. We do not incur significant fulfillment costs related to customer contracts which would require capitalization.
Disaggregation of Revenue
See Note 9 for disaggregation of our net sales by class of similar product and type of customer.
Advertising Expense
We expense advertising as it is incurred.

The following table summarizes advertising expense as a percentage of net sales in each of the years ended June 30:

Research and Development Costs
We expense research and development costs as they are incurred.
 The estimated amount spent during each of the last three years on research and development activities was less than 
1
% of net sales.
Stock-Based Employee Compensation Plans
We account for our stock-based employee compensation plans in accordance with GAAP for stock-based compensation, which requires the measurement and recognition of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The cost of the employee services is recognized as compensation expense over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award, which is typically the vesting period.
 See further discussion and disclosure in Note 10.
Income Taxes
Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in numerous domestic jurisdictions.
42
Table of Contents
THE MARZETTI COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Tabular amounts in thousands, except per share data)
Our annual effective tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the permanent tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences are temporary, reversing over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A change in tax rates may result in stranded tax effects when the effect of the change is required to be included in income even when the related income tax effects of items in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss were originally recognized in other comprehensive income rather than in income. Our accounting policy is to release stranded tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive loss.
Realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized and thus we have not recorded any valuation allowance for the years ended June 30, 2025 or 2024.
In accordance with accounting literature related to uncertainty in income taxes, tax benefits and liabilities from uncertain tax positions that are recognized in the financial statements are measured based on the largest attribute that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. See further discussion in Note 8.
Earnings Per Share
Earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents (restricted stock, stock-settled stock appreciation rights and performance units) outstanding during each period. Unvested shares of restricted stock granted to employees are considered participating securities since employees receive nonforfeitable dividends prior to vesting and, therefore, are included in the earnings allocation in computing EPS under the two-class method. Basic EPS excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, which includes the dilutive potential common shares associated with nonparticipating restricted stock, stock-settled stock appreciation rights and performance units.
Basic and diluted net income per common share were calculated as follows:

Comprehensive Income and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)
Comprehensive income includes changes in equity that result from transactions and economic events from non-owner sources. Comprehensive income is composed of two subsets – net income and other comprehensive income (loss). Included in other comprehensive income (loss) are pension and postretirement benefits adjustments.

Recent Accounting Standards
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued new accounting guidance related to the disclosure requirements for reportable segments. The new guidance requires enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. Additionally, all current annual disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets will also be required in interim periods. The new guidance also requires disclosure of the title and position of the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) and explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The amendments should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. We adopted this guidance for our annual disclosures in fiscal 2025, and this guidance will be effective for our interim-period disclosures in fiscal 2026. As the guidance only relates to disclosures, there was no impact on our financial position or results of operations. See segment disclosures in Note 9.
In December 2023, the FASB issued new accounting guidance related to the disclosure requirements for income taxes. The new guidance requires annual disclosures in the rate reconciliation table to be presented using both percentages and reporting currency amounts, and this table must include disclosure of specific categories. Additional information will also be required for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. The new guidance also requires enhanced disclosures of income taxes paid, including the amount of income taxes paid disaggregated by federal, state and foreign taxes and the amount of income taxes paid disaggregated by individual jurisdictions that exceed a quantitative threshold. The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis, but retrospective application is permitted. This guidance will be effective for our annual disclosures in fiscal 2026. As the guidance only relates to disclosures, there will be no impact on our financial position or results of operations.
In November 2024, the FASB issued new accounting guidance requiring disclosure of disaggregated income statement expenses. For each relevant expense caption presented on the face of the income statement, the following expense components must be presented in a tabular format within the notes to the financial statements at each interim and annual reporting period: purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, intangible asset amortization and depletion expense. Certain amounts already required to be disclosed under current GAAP requirements must also be presented in the same disclosure as the new disaggregation requirements. The new guidance also requires disclosure of a qualitative description of the amounts remaining in relevant expense captions that are not separately disaggregated quantitatively. Additionally, the total amount of selling expenses must be disclosed, and, in annual reporting periods, our definition of selling expenses must also be provided.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Tabular amounts in thousands, except per share data)
The amendments should be applied either prospectively to financial statements issued for reporting periods after the effective date or retrospectively to any or all prior periods presented in the financial statements. This guidance will be effective for our annual disclosures in fiscal 2028 and for our interim-period disclosures in fiscal 2029. As the guidance only relates to disclosures, there will be no impact on our financial position or results of operations.
Note 2 – 
Acquisition
On February 18, 2025, we completed the acquisition of a sauce and dressing production facility and related real estate in the Atlanta, Georgia area (“Atlanta plant”) along with certain equipment and assets contained in the facility from Winland Foods, Inc. This facility will benefit our core sauce and dressing operations through improved operational efficiency, incremental capacity, and closer proximity to certain core customers while enhancing our manufacturing network from a business continuity standpoint. The purchase price of $
78.8
 million, which included inventory adjustments and is subject to future post-closing adjustments, was funded with cash on hand. The results of operations for this facility have been included in our condensed consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. This acquisition is not significant to our financial position or results of operations.
The following table summarizes the preliminary purchase price allocation based on the fair value of the net assets acquired.

Further adjustments may occur to the allocation above as certain aspects of the transaction, most notably final inventory adjustments, are finalized during the measurement period.
The goodwill recognized above arose because the purchase price for the Atlanta plant reflected a number of factors, including the production capabilities of the facility and the potential to expand production in the future. Goodwill also resulted from the workforce acquired. As this facility is expected to primarily produce products for our Foodservice segment, all goodwill from this acquisition was recorded to the Foodservice segment. We did not identify any intangible assets apart from goodwill.
Pro forma results of operations have not been presented herein as the acquisition was not material to our results of operations.
Note 3 – 
Long-Term Debt
At June 30, 2025 and 2024, we had an unsecured credit facility (“Facility”) under which we could borrow, on a revolving credit basis, up to a maximum of $
150
 million at any one time, with potential to expand the total credit availability to $
225
 million based on consent of the issuing banks and certain other conditions. The Facility expires on 
March 6, 2029
, and all outstanding amounts are then due and payable. Interest is variable based upon formulas tied to SOFR or an alternate base rate defined in the Facility. We must also pay facility fees that are tied to our then-applicable consolidated leverage ratio. Loans may be used for general corporate purposes. Due to the nature of its terms, when we have outstanding borrowings under the Facility, they will be classified as long-term debt. 
The Facility contains certain restrictive covenants, including limitations on liens, asset sales and acquisitions. There are two principal financial covenants: an interest expense test that requires us to maintain an interest coverage ratio not less than 
2.5
 to 1 at the end of each fiscal quarter; and an indebtedness test that requires us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio not greater than 
3.5
 to 1, subject to certain exceptions. The interest coverage ratio is calculated by dividing Consolidated EBIT by Consolidated Interest Expense, and the leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Consolidated Net Debt by Consolidated EBITDA. All financial terms used in the covenant calculations are defined more specifically in the Facility.
At June 30, 2025 and 2024, we had 
no
 borrowings outstanding under the Facility. At June 30, 2025 and 2024, we had $
2.6
 million and $
2.2
 million, respectively, of standby letters of credit outstanding, which reduced the amount available for borrowing under the Facility. We paid 
no
 interest in 2025 and 2024.

Commitments and Contingencies
At June 30, 2025, we were a party to various claims and litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Such matters did not have a material effect on the current-year results of operations and, in our opinion, their ultimate disposition is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
18
% of our employees are represented under various ongoing collective bargaining contracts. The labor contract for our Vineland, New Jersey plant facility, which produces frozen bread products, will expire on December 31, 2025. 
5
% of our employees are represented under this collective bargaining contract. There is also a labor contract for our Milpitas, California plant facility, which is expected to close in the quarter ending September 30, 2025. None of our other collective bargaining contracts will expire within one year.

Note 9 – 
Business Segment Information
Our financial results are presented as two reportable segments: Retail and Foodservice. Costs that are directly attributable to either Retail or Foodservice are charged directly to the appropriate segment. Costs that are deemed to be indirect, excluding corporate expenses and other unusual significant transactions, are allocated to the two reportable segments using a reasonable methodology that is consistently applied.
Retail - The vast majority of the products we sell in the Retail segment are sold through sales personnel, food brokers and distributors in the United States. We have products typically marketed in the shelf-stable section of the grocery store, which include licensed sauces and dressings, along with our own branded salad dressings and croutons. Within the frozen food section of the grocery store, we sell yeast rolls and garlic breads. We also have placement of products in grocery produce departments through our refrigerated salad dressings, licensed dressings, vegetable dips and fruit dips.
Foodservice - The vast majority of the products we sell in the Foodservice segment are sold through sales personnel, food brokers and distributors in the United States. Most of the products we sell in the Foodservice segment are custom-formulated sauces, salad dressings, frozen breads and yeast rolls. The majority of our Foodservice sales are products sold under private label to national chain restaurant accounts. We also manufacture and sell various branded Foodservice products to distributors. Finally, within this segment, for a period of up to twelve months commencing in March 2025, we are manufacturing and selling certain salad dressing and sauce products under a temporary supply agreement (“TSA”) resulting from the Atlanta plant acquisition.
Our Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) is our Chief Executive Officer. Our CODM evaluates segment performance based on net sales and operating income. On a monthly basis, our CODM reviews results in comparison to the annual operating plan (“AOP”), the latest forecast and prior-year results. Resource allocation decisions are primarily made through the forecasting process, including development of the AOP. As many of our products are similar between our two segments, our procurement, manufacturing, warehousing and distribution activities are substantially integrated across our operations in order to maximize efficiency and productivity. Consequently, we do not prepare, and our CODM does not review, separate balance sheets or property additions for the reportable segments. As such, our external reporting does not include the presentation of identifiable assets or depreciation and amortization separately by reportable segment.

Long-lived assets are predominately domestic. Retail and Foodservice identifiable assets include those assets used in our operations and other intangible assets allocated to purchased businesses, most notably goodwill. The increase in Retail and Foodservice identifiable assets from June 30, 2024 to June 30, 2025 reflects the acquisition of the Atlanta plant. The increase in Retail and Foodservice identifiable assets from June 30, 2023 to June 30, 2024 reflected a new operating lease right-of-use asset for a warehouse in Union City, Georgia. Corporate assets consist principally of cash and equivalents. The increase in Corporate assets from June 30, 2023 to June 30, 2024 reflected higher cash and equivalents.

Our relationship with Chick-fil-A, Inc. (“Chick-fil-A”), one of our national chain restaurant accounts, represents a significant portion of our consolidated net sales. In Foodservice, we primarily supply Chick-fil-A indirectly through multiple distributors with the remainder supplied directly to Chick-fil-A. None of these individual customers amounts to more than 10% of our consolidated net sales. Chick-fil-A is also a significant contributor to our Retail sales as we sell their sauce and dressing products into the retail channel through an exclusive license agreement. Retail segment net sales attributed to Walmart also represent a significant portion of our consolidated net sales. Total net sales attributable to Chick-fil-A, including the Retail sales resulting from the exclusive license agreement and the Foodservice sales, and Retail segment net sales attributable to Walmart for each of the years ended June 30 were as follows:

Stock-Based Compensation
Our shareholders previously approved the Lancaster Colony Corporation 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2015 Plan”). The 2015 Plan reserved 
1,500,000
 common shares for issuance to our employees and directors. All awards granted under this plan will be exercisable at prices not less than fair market value as of the date of the grant. The vesting period for awards granted under this plan varies as to the type of award granted, and the maximum term of these awards is 
seven years
.
We recognize compensation expense over the requisite service period of the grant. Compensation expense is reflected in Cost of Sales or Selling, General and Administrative Expenses based on the grantees’ salaries expense classification. We estimate a forfeiture rate based on historical experience.
Stock-Settled Stock Appreciation Rights
Prior to 2022, we used periodic grants of stock-settled stock appreciation rights (“SSSARs”) as a vehicle for rewarding certain employees with long-term incentives for their efforts in helping to create long-term shareholder value. Our policy is to issue shares upon SSSARs exercise from new shares that had been previously authorized. The SSSARs we granted generally vested over a 3-year period whereby one-third vested on the first anniversary of the grant date, one-third vested on the second anniversary of the grant date and one-third vested on the third anniversary of the grant date. At June 30, 2025, there were no unvested SSSARs outstanding.

Restricted Stock
We use periodic grants of restricted stock as a vehicle for rewarding our nonemployee directors and certain employees with long-term incentives for their efforts in helping to create long-term shareholder value.
In 2025, 2024 and 2023, we granted shares of restricted stock to various employees under the terms of the plan. The following table summarizes information relating to these grants:

Performance Units
Beginning in 2022, we use periodic grants of performance units as a vehicle for rewarding certain employees with long-term incentives for their efforts in helping to create long-term shareholder value. These performance units are based on two performance metrics, with equal weightings, as follows:
•
a market condition based on relative total shareholder return versus the S&P 1500 Packaged Foods & Meats Index; and
•
a performance condition based on revenue growth over the applicable performance period.
These performance units vest 
3
 years after the grant date and are settled in shares of common stock equal to the number of performance units granted multiplied by a percentage between 
0
% and 
200
% depending on the achievement of the above-noted performance metrics over the 
3
-year performance period. Our policy is to issue shares upon the vesting of performance units from new shares that had been previously authorized. Dividend equivalents earned during the vesting period are paid at the time the awards vest.
In 2025, 2024 and 2023, we granted performance units to various employees under the terms of the plan. The following table summarizes information relating to these grants:

Note 11 – 
Pension Benefits
Defined Benefit Pension Plans
Prior to November 30, 2024, we sponsored multiple defined benefit pension plans that covered certain former employees under collective bargaining contracts related to closed or sold operations. All these plans were previously frozen. In August 2024, our Board of Directors approved the merger of all five pension plans and the termination of the resulting merged plan. The merged plan was terminated effective November 30, 2024. Lump sum distributions and annuity purchases from a highly rated insurance company were completed in December 2024. No additional pension plan contributions were required. As a result of the pension termination, we incurred a one-time noncash settlement charge of $
14.0
 million in 2025.
Prior to the termination of the merged plan discussed above, we discounted our plan liabilities at the end of the year using an assumed discount rate. In estimating this rate, we, along with our third-party actuaries, reviewed the timing of future benefit payments, bond indices, yield curve analysis results and the past history of discount rates.
The actuarial present value of benefit obligations summarized below was based on the following assumption:

Multiemployer Plans
In the three years ended June 30, 2025, one of our subsidiaries participated in a multiemployer plan that provides pension benefits to retiree workers under a collective bargaining contract. This plan generally provides for retirement, death and/or termination benefits for eligible employees within the collective bargaining contract, based on specific eligibility/participation requirements, vesting periods and benefit formulas. The risks of participating in a multiemployer plan are different from single-employer plans in the following aspects: (1) assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers, (2) if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers and (3) if a participating employer chooses to stop participating in the multiemployer plan, it may be required to pay the plan an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability.
Our participation in this multiemployer pension plan for the three years ended June 30, 2025 is reflected in the following table. All information in the table is as of December 31 of the relevant year, except contributions which are based on our fiscal year, or except as otherwise noted. The EIN/PN column provides the Employer Identification Number (“EIN”) and the Plan Number (“PN”). The pension protection act zone status is based on information that we received from the plan. Among other factors, generally, plans in critical status (red zone) are less than 65 percent funded, plans in endangered or seriously endangered status (yellow zone or orange zone, respectively) are less than 80 percent funded, and plans at least 80 percent funded are said to be in the green zone. The FIP/RP status pending/implemented column indicates plans for which a funding improvement plan (“FIP”) or a rehabilitation plan (“RP”) is either pending or has been implemented by the trustees of each plan. There have been no significant changes that affect the comparability of 2025, 2024 or 2023 contributions.

Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management must apply its judgment in evaluating the cost–benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
As required by SEC Rule 13a-15(b), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of June 30, 2025.
REPORT OF MANAGEMENT
Internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that:
1.
Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;
2.
Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our directors; and
3.
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of an unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is only possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework
 (2013) published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the most recent year. 
Our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. Their opinion, as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, is stated in their report, which is set forth on the following page.
There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of The Marzetti Company
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Marzetti Company (formerly Lancaster Colony Corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of June 30, 2025, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by COSO
.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2025, of the Company and our report dated August 21, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
