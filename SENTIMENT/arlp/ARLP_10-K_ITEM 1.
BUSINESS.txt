ITEM 1.
BUSINESS
​
Introduction
​
We are a diversified natural resource company that generates operating and royalty income from the production and marketing of coal to major domestic utilities, industrial users and international customers, as well as royalty income from oil & gas mineral interests located in strategic producing regions across the United States. The primary focus of our business is to maximize the value of our existing mineral assets, both in the production of coal from our mining assets and the leasing and development of our coal and oil & gas mineral ownership. Our strategy is to provide our customers with reliable, baseload fuel for electricity generation to meet load expectations. In addition, we continue to position ourselves as a reliable energy provider for the future as we pursue opportunities that support the growth and development of energy and related infrastructure. We intend to pursue strategic investments that leverage our core competencies and relationships with electric utilities, industrial customers, and federal and state governments. We believe that our diverse and rich resource base and strategic investments will allow us to continue to create long-term value for unitholders.
​
We are the second largest coal producer in the eastern United States with seven operating underground mining complexes in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia as well as a coal-loading terminal in Indiana on the Ohio River. We manage and report our coal operations under two regions, Illinois Basin and Appalachia. We market our coal production to major domestic and international utilities and industrial users.
​
We own mineral and royalty interests in approximately 70,000 net royalty acres, including approximately 4,000 net royalty acres attributable to our equity interest in AllDale III, in premier oil & gas producing regions in the United States, primarily the Permian, Anadarko, and Williston Basins. While we own both oil & gas mineral and royalty interests, we refer to them collectively as mineral interests throughout our discussions of our business as the majority of our holdings are mineral interests. We market our oil & gas mineral interests for lease to operators in those regions and generate royalty income from the leasing and development of those mineral interests. Reserve additions and the associated cash flows are expected to increase from the development of our existing mineral interests and through acquisitions of additional mineral interests. 
​
We hold coal mineral reserves and resources in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Substantially all of our coal mineral resources and a majority of our coal mineral reserves are owned or leased by Alliance Resource Properties, which are (a) leased or subleased to internal mining complexes or (b) near other internal and external coal mining operations but not yet leased. We generate royalty income from the leasing and development of our coal mineral reserves and resources.
​
We also have other growth investments such as our technology company, Matrix Group, which develops and markets industrial, mining and technology products and services worldwide and Bitiki, which mines bitcoin to monetize already paid for, yet underutilized, electricity load. We have also invested in energy and infrastructure opportunities including Ascend, Francis, Infinitum, and NGP ET IV. 
​
ARLP, a Delaware limited partnership, completed its initial public offering on August 19, 1999, and is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “ARLP.” We are managed by our sole general partner, MGP, a Delaware limited liability company, which holds a non-economic general partner interest in ARLP. 

​
Joint Development Agreement
​
On January 16, 2024, Matrix Design entered into an agreement with Infinitum to jointly develop and distribute high-efficiency motors and advanced motor controllers designed specifically for the mining industry. Under the agreement, Matrix Design will integrate Infinitum’s motor technology into mining equipment of our operating subsidiaries to provide performance validation in production environments for jointly developed products and to improve our operational efficiency, and market the jointly developed technology and products to third parties worldwide. During the latter half of 2024, we began using in certain of our mine complexes mining equipment that incorporate Infinitum’s components. Please see “Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence—

Coal Mining Operations
​
Coal is used primarily for the generation of electric power and the production of steel but is also used for chemical, food, and cement processing. We produce bituminous coal from our underground mines that is sold to customers principally for electric power generation (thermal) and the production of steel (metallurgical). We have established long-term relationships with customers through exemplary and consistent performance.
​
At December 31, 2024, our mining operations, which are held by Alliance Coal, had access to approximately 631.7 million tons of coal mineral reserves and 1.07 billion tons of coal mineral resources in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. Substantially, all of our coal mineral resources and 535.9 million tons of our coal mineral reserves are owned or leased by Alliance Resource Properties and are currently leased or subleased or held for lease or sublease to our mining operations or others. We produce a diverse range of thermal and metallurgical coal with varying sulfur and heat contents, which enables us to satisfy the broad range of specifications required by our customers. In 2024, we sold 33.3 million tons of coal and produced 32.2 million tons. Of the 33.3 million tons sold, 63% were leased from Alliance Resource Properties. The coal we sold in 2024 was approximately 20.4% low-sulfur coal, 47.4% medium-

sulfur coal, and 32.3% high-sulfur coal. In 2024, 80.3% of our tons sold were purchased by domestic electric utilities and 17.3% were sold into the international markets through brokered transactions. The balance of our tons sold was to third-party resellers and industrial consumers domestically. For tons sold to domestic electric utilities, 100.0% were sold to utility plants with installed pollution control devices. The Btu content of our coal ranges from 11,450 to 13,200.

We lease most of our coal mineral reserves and resources from Alliance Resource Properties or private parties and generally have the right to maintain leases in force until the exhaustion of mineable and merchantable coal located within the leased premises or a larger coal mineral reserve or resource area. These leases provide for royalties to be paid to the lessors at a fixed amount per ton or as a percentage of the sales price. Many leases require payment of minimum royalties, payable either at the time of the execution of the lease or in periodic installments, even if no mining activities have begun. These minimum royalties are normally credited against the production royalties owed to a lessor once coal production has commenced.
​
Illinois Basin Operations
​
Our Illinois Basin mining operations are located in western Kentucky, southern Illinois, and southern Indiana. As of December 31, 2024, we have 2,266 employees and we operate four active mining complexes in the Illinois Basin.

MC Mining coal production in 2024 was 0.9 million tons. 
​
Coal Marketing and Sales
​
We sell coal to an established customer base through existing business relationships or through formal bidding processes. As is customary in the coal industry, we have entered into long-term coal supply agreements with many of our customers. These arrangements are mutually beneficial to our customers and us in that they provide greater predictability of sales volumes and sales prices. Although some utility customers have appeared to favor a shorter-term contracting strategy, during 2024 approximately 83.6% and 87.7% of our sales tonnage and total coal sales, respectively, were sold under long-term contracts with committed term expirations ranging from 2025 to 2030. The contractual time commitments for customers to nominate future purchase volumes under these contracts are typically sufficient to allow us to balance our sales commitments with prospective production capacity. 
​

Table of Contents
The provisions of long-term contracts are the results of both bidding procedures and extensive negotiations with each customer. As a result, the provisions of these contracts vary significantly in many respects, including, among other factors, price adjustment features, price, and contract reopener terms, permitted sources of supply, force majeure provisions, and coal qualities and quantities. A portion of our long-term contracts is subject to price adjustment provisions, which periodically permit an increase or decrease in the contract price, typically to reflect changes in specified indices or changes in production costs resulting from regulatory changes, or both. These provisions, however, may not ensure that the contract price will reflect every change in production or other costs. The failure of the parties to agree on a price pursuant to an adjustment or a reopener provision can, in some instances, lead to the early termination of a contract. Some of our long-term contracts also permit the contract to be reopened for renegotiation of terms and conditions other than pricing terms, and where a mutually acceptable agreement on terms and conditions cannot be concluded, either party may have the option to terminate the contract. Long-term contracts typically stipulate the method for the transportation of coal, and procedures for quality control, sampling, and weighing. Most contain provisions requiring us to deliver coal within stated ranges for specific coal characteristics such as heat, sulfur, ash, moisture, grindability, volatility, and other qualities. Failure to meet these specifications can result in economic penalties, rejection or suspension of shipments, or termination of the contracts. While most of the contracts specify the approved seams and/or approved locations from which the coal is to be mined, some contracts allow the coal to be sourced from more than one mine or location. Although the volume to be delivered pursuant to a long-term contract is stipulated, the buyers often have the option to vary the volume within specified limits. Coal contracts typically contain force majeure provisions allowing for the suspension of performance by either party for the duration of specified events. Force majeure events include but are not limited to unexpected significant geological conditions and weather events that may disrupt transportation. Depending on the language of the contract, some contracts may terminate upon an event of force majeure that extends for a certain period.
​
The international coal market has been a part of our business with indirect sales to end-users in Europe, Africa, Asia, North America, and South America. Our sales into the international coal market are considered exports and the majority are made through brokered transactions. During the year ended December 31, 2024, export tons represented approximately 17.3% of tons sold. Because title on our export shipments typically transfers to our brokerage customers at a point that does not necessarily reflect the end-delivery point, we attribute export tons to the country with the end-delivery point, if known.
​
Reliance on Major Customers
​
In 2024, we derived more than 10% of our total revenue from each of American Electric Power Company Inc., Louisville Gas and Electric Company, and Tennessee Valley Authority. We did not derive 10% or more of our revenues from any other single customer. For more information about these customers, please read “Item 8. Financial Statement and Supplemental Data—Note 20 – Concentration of Credit Risk and Major Customers.”
​
Coal Competition
​
The coal industry is intensely competitive. The most important factors on which we compete are coal price, coal quality (including sulfur and heat content), reliability and diversity of supply, and transportation costs from the mine to the customer. We are the second largest coal producer in the eastern United States. Our principal competitors include American Consolidated Natural Resources Inc., Core Natural Resources, Inc., Alpha Metallurgical Resources, Inc., Foresight Energy LP, and Peabody Energy Corporation. We also compete directly with smaller producers in the Illinois Basin and Appalachian regions. In addition, we seek to export a portion of our coal into international coal markets and we compete with companies that produce coal from one or more foreign countries.
​
The price per ton for our export coal sales is influenced by many factors, such as global economic conditions, weather patterns, and global supply and demand, among others. The price per ton for our domestic coal sales are primarily linked to coal consumption patterns of domestic electricity-generating utilities, which in turn are influenced by economic activity, government regulations, weather, and technological developments, as well as the location, quality, price and availability of competing sources of fuel and alternative energy sources such as natural gas, nuclear energy, petroleum and renewable energy sources for electrical power generation.
