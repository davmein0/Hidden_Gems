ITEM 3.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
​
From time to time, we are party to litigation matters incidental to the conduct of our business. It is the opinion of management that the ultimate resolution of our pending litigation matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation or liquidity. However, we cannot assure you that disputes or litigation will not arise or that we will be able to resolve any such future disputes or litigation in a satisfactory manner. From time to time, we are also a party to certain environmental legal proceedings involving governmental authorities. Our threshold for disclosing material environmental legal proceedings involving a governmental authority where potential monetary sanctions are involved is $1.0 million. The information under “General Litigation” and “Other” in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 16 – Commitments and Contingencies” is incorporated herein by this reference.
​
Litigation was initiated in November 2019 in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky 
(Branson v. Webster County Coal, LLC, et al.)
 against certain of our subsidiaries in which the plaintiffs allege violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and state law due to alleged failure to compensate for time “donning” and “doffing” equipment and to account for certain bonuses in the calculation of overtime rates and pay. A similar lawsuit was initiated in March 2020 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky 
(Brewer v. Alliance Coal, LLC, et al.).
 Subsequently, four additional lawsuits making similar allegations were initiated against certain of our subsidiaries: filed March 4, 2021 in the Circuit Court for Hopkins County, Kentucky 
(Johnson v. Hopkins County Coal, LLC, et al.)
; filed April 6, 2021 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia 
(Rettig v. Mettiki Coal WV, LLC, et al.);
 filed April 9, 2021 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois 
(Cates v. Hamilton County Coal, LLC, et al.)
; and filed April 13, 2021 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana 
(Prater v. Gibson County Coal, LLC, et al.).
 The plaintiffs in these cases sought class and collective action certification, which we opposed. The plaintiffs sought to recover alleged compensatory, liquidated and/or exemplary damages for the alleged underpayment, and costs and fees that potentially may be recoverable under applicable law. In April 2024, we entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs pursuant to which we agreed to settle all six cases for $15.3 million. The settlement is subject to and awaiting court approval. If the settlement is not approved by the court, we believe our ultimate exposure, if any should litigation resume, will not be material to our results of operations or financial position; however, if our current belief as to the merit of the claims in these lawsuits is not upheld if litigation were to resume, it is reasonably possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters could result in a potential loss that may be material to our results of operations.

The common units representing limited partners’ interests are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “ARLP.” The common units began trading on August 20, 1999. There were approximately 57,137 record holders of common units at December 31, 2024.
​
Available cash with respect to each quarter may, at the discretion of our general partner, be distributed to the limited partners as of a record date selected by the general partner. “Available cash,” as defined in our partnership agreement, generally means, with respect to any quarter, all cash on hand at the end of each quarter, plus working capital borrowings after the end of the quarter, less cash reserves in the amount necessary or appropriate in the reasonable discretion of our general partner to (a) provide for the proper conduct of our business, (b) comply with applicable law or any debt instrument or other agreement of ours or any of our affiliates, and (c) provide funds for distributions to unitholders for any one or more of the next four quarters.

​
Unit Repurchase Program
​
On May 31, 2018, ARLP announced that the Board of Directors approved the establishment of a unit repurchase program authorizing ARLP to repurchase up to $100.0 million of its outstanding limited partner common units. In January 2023, the Board of Directors authorized a $93.5 million increase to the unit purchase program, which had $6.5 million of available capacity at the time, authorizing us to be able to repurchase up to a total of $100.0 million of ARLP common units from that date. The unit repurchase program is intended to enhance ARLP’s ability to achieve its goal of creating long-term value for its unitholders and provides another means, along with quarterly cash distributions, of returning cash to unitholders. The program has no time limit and ARLP may repurchase units from time to time in the open market or other privately negotiated transactions. The unit repurchase program authorization does not obligate ARLP to repurchase any dollar amount or number of units, and repurchases may be commenced or suspended from time to time without prior notice. 
​
During the three months ended December 31, 2024, we did not repurchase and retire any units. Since the inception of the unit repurchase program, we have repurchased and retired 6,390,446 units at an average unit price of $17.67 for an aggregate purchase price of $112.9 million. The remaining authorized amount for unit repurchases under this program was $80.6 million as of December 31, 2024.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
 OPERATIONS
​
The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and notes thereto included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” where you can find more detailed information in “Note 1 – Organization and Presentation” and “Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” regarding the basis of presentation supporting the following financial information.
​
Executive Overview
​
Organization 
​
We are a diversified natural resource company that generates operating and royalty income from the production and marketing of coal to major domestic utilities, industrial users and international customers, as well as royalty income from oil & gas mineral interests located in strategic producing regions across the United States. Our strategy is to provide our customers with reliable, baseload fuel for electricity generation to meet load expectations. The primary focus of our business is to maximize the value of our existing mineral assets, both in the production of coal from our mining assets and the leasing and development of our coal and oil & gas mineral ownership. In addition, we continue to position ourselves as a reliable energy provider for the future as we pursue opportunities that support the growth and development of energy and related infrastructure. We intend to pursue strategic investments that leverage our core competencies and relationships with electric utilities, industrial customers, and federal and state governments. We believe that our diverse and rich resource base and strategic investments will allow us to continue to create long-term value for unitholders.
​
We are the second largest coal producer in the eastern United States with seven operating underground mining complexes near many of the major eastern utility generating plants and on major coal hauling railroads in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia, as well as a coal-loading terminal in Indiana. Two of our mines also have loading facilities located on the Ohio River. 
​
In addition to our mining operations, Alliance Resource Properties owns or leases substantially all of our coal mineral resources and the majority of our coal mineral reserves in the Illinois and Appalachia Basins that are (a) leased to our internal mining complexes or (b) near our coal mining operations but not yet leased. 
​
We currently own minerals interests in approximately 70,000 net royalty acres in premier oil & gas producing regions of the United States, primarily in the Permian (Delaware and Midland), Anadarko (SCOOP/STACK) and Williston (Bakken) basins providing us with diversified exposure to industry-leading operators consistent with our general strategy to grow our oil & gas mineral interest business. 
​
We have invested in energy and infrastructure opportunities including our investments in Francis, Infinitum, NGP ET IV, and Ascend which are in the businesses of, respectively, electric vehicle charging stations, electric motor manufacturing, private equity investments in renewable energy, the electrification of our economy or the efficient use of energy, and the manufacturing and recycling of sustainable, engineered battery materials for electric vehicles.
