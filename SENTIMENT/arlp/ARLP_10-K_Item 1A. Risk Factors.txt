Unit Repurchase Program
​
In January 2023, the Board of Directors authorized a $93.5 million increase to the unit repurchase program, which had $6.5 million of available capacity as of December 31, 2022. As a result, we were authorized to repurchase up to a total of $100.0 million of ARLP’s limited partner common units. No units were repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2024. The remaining authorized amount for unit repurchases under this program was $80.6 million at December 31, 2024. Please read “Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Unitholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” for more information on the unit repurchase program. 
​
February 2024 Equipment Financing
​
On February 28, 2024, Alliance Coal entered into an equipment financing arrangement, wherein Alliance Coal received $54.6 million in exchange for conveying its interest in certain equipment owned indirectly by Alliance Coal and entering into a master lease agreement for that equipment. For additional information on the February 2024 Equipment Financing, please see “Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 12 – Long-Term Debt.”
​
Securitization Facility
​
In January 2025, we extended the term of the Securitization Facility to January 2026 and decreased the borrowing availability under the facility to $75.0 million. For additional information on the Securitization Facility please read “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 12 – Long-Term Debt”.
​

8.625% Senior Notes due 2029
​
On June 12, 2024, the Intermediate Partnership and Alliance Finance (as co-issuer) issued an aggregate principal amount of $400 million of senior unsecured notes due 2029 in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers. A portion of the proceeds were used to redeem the outstanding balance of $284.6 million of our 7.5% Senior Notes due 2025, and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. For additional information on the 8.625% Senior Notes due 2029 and the redemption of our 7.5% Senior Notes due 2025, please see “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 12 – Long-Term Debt.”
​
Mine Development Project

​
In 2022, we began development of the Henderson County mine which continued through 2023 and into 2024. We have deployed capital of $114.3 million through 2024 and currently anticipate deploying capital of approximately $6.6 million in 2025 to complete the project. We have funded our capital expenditures and expect to fund our remaining capital expenditures for the project with cash from operations or borrowings under our credit facilities. We anticipate the new mine will enable us to access an additional 109.5 million clean recoverable tons of coal.
​
Cash Flows
​
Cash provided by operating activities was $803.1 million for 2024 compared to $824.2 million for 2023. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the decrease in net income adjusted for non-cash items and

unfavorable working capital changes primarily related to accounts payable. These decreases were partially offset by favorable working capital changes primarily related to trade receivables, inventories, and miscellaneous other changes.
​
Net cash used in investing activities was $440.7 million for 2024 compared to $553.3 million for 2023. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to acquisitions of oil & gas reserves including the JC Resources Acquisition and purchase of investments in 2023 as well as an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities for property, plant and equipment. These decreases were partially offset by increased capital expenditures during 2024. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 4 – Acquisitions” for more information on the Belvedere, Jase, JC Resources and Skyland Acquisitions.
​
Net cash used in financing activities was $285.3 million for 2024 compared to $507.1 million for 2023. The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to the issuance of our 8.625% Senior Notes due 2029, borrowings under our February 2024 Equipment Financing and the purchase of units under our repurchase program in 2023. These decreases were partially offset by the redemption of our remaining 7.5% Senior Notes due 2025 and cash settlement of grants under our deferred compensation plans. 
​
Cash Requirements 
​
We currently estimate our 2025 annual cash requirements, including capital expenditures, scheduled payments on long-term debt, lease obligations, asset retirement obligation costs and workers’ compensation and pneumoconiosis, to be in a range of $519.0 million to $554.0 million. Management anticipates having sufficient cash flow to meet 2024 cash requirements with our December 31, 2024 cash and cash equivalents of $137.0 million and cash flows from operations, or borrowings under revolving credit and securitization facilities or other sources of financing that we expect to have available if necessary. We currently project average estimated annual maintenance capital expenditures over the next five years of approximately $7.28 per ton produced. For additional information on our future cash requirements other than capital expenditures, please see “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 12 – Long-Term Debt,” “—Note 11 – Leases,” “—Note 14 – Employee Benefit Plans,” “—Note 15 – Asset Retirement Obligations,” “—Note 13 – Accrued Workers’ Compensation and Pneumoconiosis Benefits” and “—Note 16 – Commitments and Contingencies.” We will continue to have significant cash requirements over the long term, which may require us to incur debt or seek additional equity capital. The availability and cost of additional capital will depend upon prevailing market conditions, the market price of our common units and several other factors over which we have limited control, as well as our financial condition and results of operations.
​
We use a combination of surety bonds and letters of credit to secure our financial obligations for reclamation, workers’ compensation and other obligations as follows as of December 31, 2024:

Insurance
​
Effective October 1, 2024, we renewed our property and casualty insurance program through September 30, 2025. Our property insurance was procured from our wholly owned captive insurance company, Wildcat Insurance. Wildcat Insurance charged certain of our subsidiaries for the premiums on this program and in return purchased reinsurance for the program in the standard market. The maximum limit in the commercial property program is $100.0 million per occurrence, excluding a $1.5 million deductible for property damage, a 75- or 90-day waiting period for underground business interruption depending on the mining complex and an additional $25.0 million overall aggregate deductible. We retained a 2.50% participating interest in our current commercial property insurance program. We can make no assurances that we will not experience significant insurance claims in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to purchase property insurance in the future. Also, exposures exist for which no insurance may be available and for which we have not reserved. In addition, the insurance industry has been subject to efforts by environmental activists to restrict coverages available for fossil-fuel companies.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
​
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We discuss these estimates and judgments with the Audit Committee periodically. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We have provided a description of all significant accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. The following critical accounting policies are materially impacted by judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
​
Business Combinations 
​
We account for business acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 4 – Acquisitions” for more information on the Belvedere, Jase and Skyland Acquisitions. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, if any, is recorded as goodwill. Given the time it takes to obtain pertinent information to finalize the acquired business’ balance sheet, it may be several quarters before we are able to finalize those initial fair value estimates. Accordingly, it is not uncommon for the initial estimates to be subsequently revised. The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in the consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date.
​
For the Belvedere, Jase and Skyland Acquisitions, we determined a fair value for the acquired mineral interests using an income approach consisting of discounted cash flow models. The assumptions used in the discounted cash flow models included estimated production, projected cash flows, forward oil & gas prices and risk adjusted discount rates.
​
Oil & Gas Reserve Values
​
Estimated oil & gas reserves and estimated market prices for oil & gas are a significant part of our depletion calculations, impairment analyses, and other estimates. Following are examples of how these estimates affect financial results:
​
●
an increase (decrease) in estimated proved oil & gas reserves can reduce (increase) our units of production depreciation, depletion and amortization rates; and
●
changes in oil & gas reserves and estimated market prices both impact projected future cash flows from our mineral interests. This in turn can impact our periodic impairment analysis.
​
The process of estimating oil & gas reserves is very complex, requiring significant judgment in the evaluation of all available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. After being estimated internally, our proved reserves estimates are compared to proved reserves that are audited by independent experts in connection with our required year-end reporting. The data may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including the historical 12 month average price, additional development cost and activity, evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions. As a result, material revisions to existing reserve estimates could occur from time to time. Such changes could trigger an impairment of our oil & gas mineral interests and have an impact on our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense prospectively. 
​
Estimates of future commodity prices utilized in our impairment analyses consider market information including published forward oil & gas prices. The forecasted price information used in our impairment analyses is consistent with that generally used in evaluating third-party operator drilling decisions and our expected acquisition plans, if any. Prices for future periods will impact the production economics underlying oil & gas reserve estimates. In addition, changes in the price of oil & gas also impact certain costs associated with our expected underlying production and future capital costs.

Table of Contents
The prices of oil & gas are volatile and change from period to period, thus are expected to impact our estimates. Significant unfavorable changes in the estimated future commodity prices could result in an impairment of our oil & gas mineral interests. 
​
Workers
’
 Compensation and Pneumoconiosis (Black Lung) Benefits
​
We provide income replacement and medical treatment for work-related traumatic injury claims as required by applicable state laws. We generally provide for these claims through self-insurance programs. Workers’ compensation laws also compensate survivors of workers who suffer employment related deaths. Our liability for traumatic injury claims is the estimated present value of current workers’ compensation benefits, based on our actuary estimates. Our actuarial calculations are based on a blend of actuarial projection methods and numerous assumptions including claim development patterns, mortality, medical costs and interest rates. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 13 – Accrued Workers’ Compensation and Pneumoconiosis Benefits” for additional discussion. We had accrued liabilities for workers’ compensation of $47.9 million and $48.0 million for these costs at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. A one-percentage-point reduction in the discount rate would have increased operating expense by approximately $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. We limit our exposure to traumatic injury claims by purchasing a high deductible insurance policy that starts paying benefits after deductibles for a particular claim year have been met. Our receivables for traumatic injury claims under this policy as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $3.7 million and $4.1 million, respectively.
​
Coal mining companies are subject to FMSHA and various state statutes for the payment of medical and disability benefits to eligible recipients related to coal worker’s pneumoconiosis, or black lung. We provide for these claims through self-insurance programs. Our pneumoconiosis benefits liability is calculated using the service cost method based on the actuarial present value of the estimated pneumoconiosis benefits obligation. Our actuarial calculations are based on numerous assumptions including disability incidence, medical costs, mortality, death benefits, dependents and discount rates. We had accrued liabilities of $124.3 million and $132.4 million for the pneumoconiosis benefits at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. A one-percentage-point reduction in the discount rate would have increased the expense recognized for the year ended December 31, 2024 by approximately $2.0 million. Under the service cost method used to estimate our pneumoconiosis benefits liability, actuarial gains or losses attributable to changes in actuarial assumptions, such as the discount rate, are amortized over the remaining service period of active miners.
​
The discount rate for workers’ compensation and pneumoconiosis is derived by applying the Financial Times Stock Exchange Pension Discount Curve to the projected liability payout. Other assumptions, such as claim development patterns, mortality, disability incidence and medical costs, are based on standard actuarial tables adjusted for our actual historical experiences whenever possible. We review all actuarial assumptions periodically for reasonableness and consistency and update such factors when underlying assumptions, such as discount rates, change or when sustained changes in our historical experiences indicate a shift in our trend assumptions are warranted.
​
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
​
In addition to oil & gas reserves discussed above in the 
Oil & Gas Reserve Values
 section, we review the carrying value of long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows. Long-lived assets and certain intangibles are not reviewed for impairment unless an impairment indicator is noted. Several examples of impairment indicators include:
​
●
A significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset;
●
A significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used or in its physical condition;
●
A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long-lived asset, including an adverse action of assessment by a regulator;
●
An accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long-lived asset;
●
A current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset; or
90

Table of Contents
●
A current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. The term more likely that not refers to a level of likelihood that is more than 50 percent.
​
The above factors are not all inclusive, and management must continually evaluate whether other factors are present that would indicate a long-lived asset may be impaired. If there is an indication that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recovered, we compare our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset to the carrying value of the asset group. Individual assets are grouped for impairment review purposes based on the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets, generally on a by-mine basis. Assumptions about sales, operating margins, capital expenditures and sales prices are based on our budgets, business plans, economic projections, and anticipated future cash flows. 
If the carrying value of an asset group exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset group, t
he amount of impairment is measured by the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset group. The fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on various factors, including cost replacement, the present values of expected future cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate, the marketability of the assets and the estimated fair value of assets that could be sold or used at other operations. We recorded an asset impairment of $31.1 million in 2024. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 9 – Long-Lived Asset Impairments”.
​
Asset Retirement Obligations
​
SMCRA and similar state statutes require that mined property be restored in accordance with specified standards and an approved reclamation plan. A liability is recorded for the estimated cost of future mine asset retirement and closing procedures on a present value basis when incurred or acquired and a corresponding amount is capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. Those costs relate to permanently sealing portals at underground mines and to reclaiming the final pits and support surface acreage for both our underground mines and past surface mines. Examples of these types of costs, common to both types of mining, include, but are not limited to, removing or covering refuse piles and settling ponds, water treatment obligations, and dismantling preparation plants, other facilities and roadway infrastructure. Accrued liabilities of $158.8 million and $150.4 million for these costs are recorded at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 15 – Asset Retirement Obligations” for additional information. The liability for asset retirement and closing procedures is sensitive to changes in cost estimates, estimated mine lives and timing of post-mine reclamation activities. As changes in estimates occur (such as mine plan revisions, changes in estimated costs or changes in timing of the performance of reclamation activities), the revisions to the obligation and asset are recognized at the appropriate credit-adjusted, risk-free interest rate.
​
Accounting for asset retirement obligations also requires depreciation of the capitalized asset retirement cost and accretion of the asset retirement obligation over time. Depreciation is generally determined on a units-of-production basis and accretion is generally recognized over the life of the producing assets.
​
On at least an annual basis, we review our entire asset retirement obligation liability and make necessary adjustments for permit changes approved by state authorities, changes in the timing of reclamation activities, and revisions to cost estimates and productivity assumptions, to reflect current experience. Adjustments to the liability associated with these assumptions resulted in a increase of $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. Adjustments to the liability associated with these assumptions resulted in a decrease of $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.  
​
While the precise amount of these future costs cannot be determined with certainty, we have estimated the costs and timing of future asset retirement obligations escalated for inflation, then discounted and recorded at the present value of those estimates. Discounting resulted in reducing the accrual for asset retirement obligations by $120.1 million and $116.2 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023. We estimate that the aggregate undiscounted cost of final mine closure is approximately $278.9 million and $266.6 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. If our assumptions differ from actual experiences, or if changes in the regulatory environment occur, our actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different than currently estimated.

Accruals of Other Liabilities
​
We had accruals for other liabilities, including current obligations, totaling $415.1 million and $398.4 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These accruals were chiefly comprised of workers’ compensation benefits, pneumoconiosis benefits, and costs associated with asset retirement obligations. These obligations are self-insured except for certain excess insurance coverage for workers’ compensation. The accruals of these items were based on estimates of future expenditures based on current legislation, related regulations and other developments. Thus, from time to time, our results of operations may be significantly affected by changes to these liabilities. Please see “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 15 – Asset Retirement Obligations” and “—Note 13 – Accrued Workers’ Compensation and Pneumoconiosis Benefits.”

We have significant long-term sales contracts as evidenced by approximately 83.6% of our sales tonnage being sold under long-term sales contracts in 2024. Many of the long-term sales contracts are subject to price adjustment provisions, which periodically permit an increase or decrease in the contract price, typically to reflect changes in specified indices or changes in production costs resulting from regulatory changes, or both.
