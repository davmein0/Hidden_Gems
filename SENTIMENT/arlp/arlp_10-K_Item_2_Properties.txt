Item 2. Properties” for a more detailed discussion of our various businesses. 
​
As of December 31, 2024, we had four reportable segments: Illinois Basin Coal Operations, Appalachia Coal Operations, Oil & Gas Royalties and Coal Royalties. We also have an “all other” category referred to as Other, Corporate and Elimination. Our two coal operations reportable segments correspond to major coal producing regions in the eastern United States with similar economic characteristics including coal quality, geology, coal marketing opportunities, mining and transportation methods and regulatory issues. Our Oil & Gas Royalties reportable segment includes our oil & gas mineral interests. Our Coal Royalties reportable segment includes coal mineral reserves and resources owned or leased by Alliance Resource Properties.
