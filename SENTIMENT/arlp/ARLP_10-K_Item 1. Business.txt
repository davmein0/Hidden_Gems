Item 1. Business—Coal Marketing and Sales” and “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 20 – Concentration of Credit Risk and Major Customers.” 
​
Our results of operations are highly dependent upon the prices we receive for our coal, oil and natural gas. Regarding coal, the short-term sales contracts favored by some of our coal customers leave us more exposed to risks of declining coal price periods. Also, a significant decline in oil & gas prices would have a significant impact on our oil & gas royalty revenues.   
​
We have exposure to coal and oil & gas sales prices and price risk for supplies that are used directly or indirectly in the normal course of coal and oil & gas production such as steel, electricity and other supplies. We manage our risk for these items through strategic sourcing contracts for normal quantities required by our operations. Historically, we have not utilized any commodity price-hedges or other derivatives related to either our sales price or supply cost risks but may do so in the future.
​
Credit Risk
​
In 2024, approximately 80.3% of our tons sold were purchased by U.S. electric utilities and 17.3% were sold into the international markets through brokered transactions. Therefore, our credit risk is primarily with domestic electric power generators and reputable global brokerage firms. Our policy is to independently evaluate each customer’s creditworthiness prior to entering into transactions and to constantly monitor outstanding accounts receivable. When deemed appropriate by our credit management department, we will take steps to reduce our credit exposure to customers that do not meet our credit standards or whose credit has deteriorated. These steps may include obtaining letters of credit or cash collateral, requiring prepayments for shipments or establishing customer trust accounts held for our benefit in the event of a failure to pay. Such credit risks from customers may impact the borrowing capacity of our Securitization Facility. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 12 – Long-Term Debt” for more information on our Securitization Facility.
​
Exchange Rate Risk
​
The vast majority of our transactions are denominated in United States dollars, and as a result, we do not have material exposure to currency exchange-rate risks. However, because coal is sold internationally in United States dollars, general economic conditions in foreign markets and changes in foreign currency exchange rates may provide our foreign competitors with a competitive advantage. If our competitors’ currencies decline against the United States dollar or against foreign purchasers’ local currencies, those competitors may be able to offer lower prices for coal to these purchasers. Furthermore, if the currencies of overseas purchasers were to significantly decline in value in comparison to the United States dollar, those purchasers may seek decreased prices for the coal we sell to them. Consequently, currency fluctuations could adversely affect the competitiveness of our coal in international markets.
​
Interest Rate Risk
​
Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan and Securitization Facility are at variable rates and, as a result, we have interest rate exposure. Historically, our earnings have not been materially affected by changes in interest rates and we have not utilized interest rate derivative instruments related to our outstanding debt. We had $45.7 million in borrowings under Term Loan at December 31, 2024. We did not have any outstanding borrowings on either the Revolving Credit Facility or the Securitization Facility at December 31, 2024. A one percentage point increase in the interest rates related to the Term Loan would result in an annualized increase in interest expense of $0.5 million, based on borrowing levels at December 31, 2024. With respect to our fixed-rate borrowings, we had $400.0 million in borrowings under our 2029 Senior Notes and $44.7 million in borrowings under our equipment financings at December 31, 2024. A one

percentage point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $16.9 million in the estimated fair value of these borrowings.
​
The table below provides information about our market sensitive financial instruments and constitutes a “forward-looking statement.” The fair values of long-term debt are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on our incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
​
Board of Directors of Alliance Resource Management GP, LLC and
Unitholders of Alliance Resource Partners, L.P.
​
Opinion on the financial statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Alliance Resource Partners, L.P. (a Delaware limited partnership) and subsidiaries (the “Partnership”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and partners’ capital for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule included under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Partnership as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
​
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), and our report dated February 27, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion.
​
Basis for opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Partnership’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Partnership’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Partnership in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
​
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
​
Critical audit matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
​
Valuation of workers’ compensation and pneumoconiosis benefit obligations
​
As described further in Note 13 to the financial statements, the Partnership provides income replacement and medical treatment for work-related traumatic injury claims and compensation to survivors of workers who suffer employment-related deaths. The Partnership is also liable to pay benefits for black lung disease (or pneumoconiosis) to eligible employees and former employees and their dependents. As of December 31, 2024, the Partnership’s aggregate workers’ compensation and pneumoconiosis benefit obligations were approximately $172 million. We identified valuation of workers’ compensation and pneumoconiosis benefit obligations as a critical audit matter.  
​
The principal considerations for our determination that the valuation of workers’ compensation and pneumoconiosis benefit obligations is a critical audit matter are the high level of estimation uncertainty related to determining the frequency and severity of these types of claims, as well as the inherent subjectivity in management’s judgment in estimating eligible benefits and the total cost to settle or dispose of these claims. Workers’ compensation and pneumoconiosis benefit obligations are determined using actuarial projection methods and numerous assumptions including claim development

patterns, costs, and mortality. The estimates rely on the assumption that historical claim patterns are an accurate representation for future claims.  
​
Our audit procedures related to the valuation of workers’ compensation and pneumoconiosis benefit obligations included the following, among others.
​
●
We tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls relating to the workers’ compensation and pneumoconiosis benefit obligations process including testing controls over management’s review of actuarial specialists' liability calculations and the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data.
●
We tested management’s process for determining the worker’s compensation and pneumoconiosis benefit obligation accruals, including evaluating the reasonableness of the methods and significant assumptions used in the calculations with the assistance of actuarial specialists.
●
We tested the claims data used in the actuarial calculations by inspecting source documents to test key attributes of the claims data.
●
We compared claim development patterns and cost assumptions used in the actuarial calculations for consistency with historical experience and current trends.
●
We compared the mortality tables used in the actuarial calculations to publicly available information.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
​
Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”)
​
VIEs are primarily entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities without additional financial support from other parties or whose equity holders, as a group, lack one or more of the following characteristics: (a) direct or indirect ability to make decisions, (b) obligation to absorb expected losses or (c) right to receive expected residual returns. A VIE must be evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively to determine the primary beneficiary, which is the reporting entity that has (a) the power to direct activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The primary beneficiary is required to consolidate the VIE for financial reporting purposes.
​
To determine a VIE’s primary beneficiary, we perform a qualitative assessment to determine which party, if any, has the power to direct activities of the VIE and the obligation to absorb losses and/or receive its benefits. This assessment involves identifying the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and determine whether it, or another party, has the power to direct those activities. When evaluating whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE, we perform a qualitative analysis that considers the design of the VIE, the nature of our involvement and the variable interests held by other parties. 
​
Business Combinations
​
A business consists of inputs and processes applied to those inputs that have the ability to contribute to the creation of outputs. We account for the acquisition of a business as a business combination, where we record the assets acquired, including identified intangible assets and liabilities assumed at their fair value, which in many instances involves estimates based on third-party valuations, such as appraisals, or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques. However, if substantially all the fair value of the assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets with the same risk profile, the acquisition is accounted for as an asset acquisition and recorded at cost.
​
Estimates
​
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates and assumptions include:
​
●
Asset retirement obligations;
●
Pension obligations;
●
Workers’ compensation and pneumoconiosis obligations; 
●
Acquisition related purchase price allocations; 
●
Life of mine assumptions;
●
Oil & gas reserve quantities and carrying amounts;
●
Determination of oil & gas revenue accruals; and
●
Contingent consideration liability
​
Fair Value Measurements
​
We apply fair value measurements to certain assets and liabilities. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is based on assumptions that market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and risks inherent in valuation techniques and inputs to valuations. Fair value measurements assume that the transaction occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a 
105

Table of Contents
principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset or liability (the market for which the reporting entity would be able to maximize the amount received or minimize the amount paid). Valuation techniques used in our fair value measurements are based on observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our own market assumptions.
​
We use the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels:
​
●
Level 1 
–
 Quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets that we have the ability to access at the measurement date.
​
●
Level 2 
–
 Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.
​
●
Level 3 
–

Unobservable inputs 
for the asset or liability including situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability.
​
The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable data (Level 3). In some cases, the inputs used to measure fair value might fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. The lowest level input that is significant to a fair value measurement determines the applicable level in the fair value hierarchy. Assessing the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, considering factors specific to the asset or liability. Significant fair value measurements are used in our significant estimates and are discussed throughout these notes.
​
Cash and Cash Equivalents
​
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit, including highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less. At times the ARLP Partnership maintains deposits in federally insured financial institutions in excess of stated federally insured limits.
​
Cash Management
​
The cash flows from operating activities section of our consolidated statements of cash flows reflects adjustments of $
3.3
 million and $
6.7
 million representing book overdrafts at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We did not have material book overdrafts at December 31, 2022.
​
Inventories
​
Coal inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a first-in, first-out basis. Supply, finished goods, work in process and raw materials inventories are stated at an average cost basis, less a reserve for obsolete and surplus items.
​
Advance Royalties
​
Rights to coal mineral leases are often acquired and/or maintained through advance royalty payments. Where royalty payments represent prepayments recoupable against future production, they are recorded as an asset, with amounts expected to be recouped within one year classified as a current asset. As mining occurs on these leases, the royalty prepayments are charged to operating expenses. We assess the recoverability of royalty prepayments based on estimated

future production. Royalty prepayments estimated to be nonrecoverable are expensed. Our advance royalties are summarized as follows:

Digital Assets
​
We began our crypto-mining activities during the second half of 2020 as we started mining bitcoin as a pilot project to monetize already paid for, yet underutilized, electricity load. We continue to periodically be awarded digital assets through our crypto-mining activities. The awards are accounted for as revenue and valued at the exchange quoted price at the time they are awarded. Beginning January 1, 2024, with our adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-08, 
Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60) 
(“ASU 2023-08”), the digital assets we hold are subsequently remeasured to fair value based on the exchange quoted price as of the balance sheet date and included on our consolidated balance sheets within the 
Digital assets
 line item. The activity from remeasurement of digital assets to fair value is reflected in our consolidated statements of income within the 
Change in fair value of digital assets
 line item. Digital assets sold for cash nearly immediately after they are awarded to us for mining activities are presented as cash flows from operating activities, while other sales are reflected as cash flows from investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Our realized gains or losses are determined as the difference between the proceeds received when the digital assets are sold and our cost basis in the digital assets. Our cost basis is the value of the digital assets when they are awarded less any impairment recognized prior to our adoption of ASU 2023-08. We use a first-in, first-out methodology to assign costs to our digital assets in the calculation of our realized gains or losses. See Note 7 – Digital Assets for additional information.  
​
​
Property, Plant and Equipment
​
Expenditures which extend the useful lives of existing plant and equipment assets are capitalized. Interest costs associated with major asset additions are capitalized during the construction period. Maintenance and repairs that do not extend the useful life or increase productivity of the asset are charged to operating expense as incurred. Exploration expenditures are charged to operating expense as incurred, including costs related to drilling and study costs incurred to convert or upgrade mineral resources to reserves. Processing facilities and mineral rights, assuming current production estimates, are depreciated or depleted using the units-of-production method. Mining equipment and other plant and equipment assets are depreciated principally using the straight-line method over the remaining estimated life of each mine. Buildings, office equipment and improvements are amortized straight line over their estimated useful lives. Gains or losses arising from retirements are included in operating expenses. Depletion of coal mineral rights is provided on the basis of tonnage mined in relation to estimated recoverable tonnage, which equals estimated proven and probable coal mineral reserves. Therefore, our coal mineral rights are depleted based on only proven and probable coal mineral reserves. See 
Oil & Gas Reserve Quantities and Carrying Amounts
 below for a discussion of our accounting policies for oil & gas properties.
​
Mine Development Costs
​
Mine development costs are capitalized until production, other than production incidental to the mine development process, commences and are amortized on a units of production method based on the estimated proven and probable coal mineral reserves. Mine development costs represent costs incurred in establishing access to coal mineral reserves and include costs associated with sinking or driving shafts and underground drifts, permanent excavations, roads and tunnels. The end of the development phase and the beginning of the production phase takes place when construction of the mine for economic extraction is substantially complete. Coal extracted during the development phase is incidental to the mine’s production capacity and is not considered to shift the mine into the production phase. 
​

Table of Contents
Long-Lived Asset Impairment
​
We review the carrying value of long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows. To the extent the carrying amount of an asset group is not recoverable based on undiscounted cash flows, the amount of impairment is measured by the difference between the carrying value and the fair value (See Note 9 – Long-Lived Asset Impairments). 
​
Oil & Gas Reserve Quantities and Carrying Amounts
​
We are wholly dependent on third-party operators to explore, develop, produce and operate the properties associated with our mineral interests. We follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil & gas mineral interests. Under this method, costs to acquire mineral interests in oil & gas properties are capitalized when incurred. The costs of mineral interests in unproved properties are capitalized pending the results of exploration and leasing efforts by operators. As mineral interests in unproved properties are determined to be proved, the related costs are transferred to proved oil & gas properties. 
​
Mineral interests in oil & gas properties are grouped using a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition, which we may also refer to as a depletable group. Mineral interests in proved oil & gas properties are depleted based on the units-of-production method. Proved reserves are quantities of oil & gas that can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in the future from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. Proved developed resources are the quantities expected to be recovered through the operators’ existing wells with existing equipment, infrastructure and operating methods.
​
We evaluate impairment of our oil & gas mineral interests in proved properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. This evaluation is performed on a depletable group basis. We compare the undiscounted projected future cash flows expected in connection with a depletable group to its unamortized carrying amount to determine recoverability. When the carrying amount of a depletable group exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, the carrying amount is written down to its fair value, which is measured as the present value of the projected future cash flows of such properties. The factors used to determine fair value include estimates of proved reserves, future commodity prices, timing of future production, future expenditures, and a risk-adjusted discount rate.
​
Our oil & gas mineral interests in unproved properties are also assessed for impairment periodically but at least annually when facts and circumstances indicate that the unproved property will not be transferred to proved properties. Impairment of individual unproved properties whose acquisition costs are relatively significant are assessed on a property-by-property basis, and an impairment loss is recognized if we determine that the unproved property will not be transferred to proved properties. Impairment of unproved properties whose acquisition costs are not individually significant are assessed on a group basis. Any amount of loss to be recognized and the amount of a valuation allowance needed to provide for impairment of those properties is determined by amortizing those properties in the aggregate on the basis of historical experience and other relevant information, such as the relative proportion of such properties on which proved reserves have been found in the past. 
​
Upon the sale of a complete depletable group, the book value thereof, less proceeds or salvage value, are charged to income. Upon the sale or retirement of an aggregation of interests which make up less than a complete depletable group, the proceeds are credited to accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization, unless doing so would significantly alter the depreciation, depletion and amortization rate of the depletable group, in which case a gain or loss would be recorded.
​

Equity Investments
​
Our investments and ownership interests in equity securities without readily determinable fair values in entities in which we do not have a controlling financial interest or significant influence are accounted for using a measurement alternative other than fair value which is historical cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same entity. Distributions received on those investments are recorded as income unless those distributions are considered a return on investment, in which case the historical cost is reduced. We account for our ownership interests in Infinitum and Ascend as equity securities without readily determinable fair values. See Note 10 – Equity Investments for further discussion of these investments.   
​
Our investments and ownership interests in entities in which we do not have a controlling financial interest are accounted for under the equity method of accounting if we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the entity. Investments accounted for under the equity method are initially recorded at cost, and the difference between the basis of our investment and the underlying equity in the net assets of the joint venture at the investment date, if any, is amortized over the lives of the related assets that gave rise to the difference. 
​
In the event our ownership requires a disproportionate sharing of income or loss, we use the hypothetical liquidation at book value (“HLBV”) method to determine the appropriate allocation of income or loss. Under the HLBV method, income or loss of the investee is allocated based on hypothetical amounts that each investor would be entitled to receive if the net assets held were liquidated at book value at the end of each period, adjusted for any contributions made and distributions received during the period.
​
We hold equity method investments in AllDale III, Francis and NGP ET IV. See Note 3 – Variable Interest Entities and Note 10 – Equity Investments for further discussion of our equity method investments. 
​
We review our investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a loss in the value of the investment may be other-than-temporary.
​
Leases
​
We lease buildings and equipment under operating lease agreements that provide for the payment of minimum rentals. We also have noncancelable lease agreements with third parties for land and equipment under finance lease obligations. Some of our arrangements within these agreements have both lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. We have elected a practical expedient to account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for leases of buildings and office equipment. Our leases have approximate lease terms of 
1
 to 
32 years
, some of which include automatic renewals up to 
ten years
, which are likely to be exercised and some of which include options to terminate the lease within 
one year
. We also hold numerous mineral reserve leases with both related parties as well as third parties, none of which are accounted for as an operating lease or as a finance lease. 
​
We review each agreement to determine if an arrangement within the agreement contains a lease at the inception of an arrangement. Once an arrangement is determined to contain an operating or finance lease with a term greater than 12 months, we recognize a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The lease term includes all noncancelable periods defined in the lease as well as periods covered by options to extend the lease that we are reasonably certain to exercise. As an implicit borrowing rate cannot be determined under most of our leases, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.
​
Expenses related to leases determined to be operating leases will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term including any reasonably assured renewal periods, while those determined to be finance leases will be recognized following a front-loaded expense profile in which interest and amortization are presented separately in the income statement. The determination of whether a lease is accounted for as a finance lease or an operating lease requires management to make estimates primarily about the fair value of the asset and its estimated economic useful life.

Common Unit-Based Compensation
​
We maintain the Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) for certain key employees and executive officers. Pursuant to the LTIP, unit awards of non-vested “phantom” or notional units, also referred to as “restricted units,” may be granted, which, upon satisfaction of time and performance-based vesting requirements, entitle the LTIP participant to receive ARLP common units. Certain awards may also contain a minimum-value guarantee payable in ARLP common units or cash that would be paid regardless of whether the awards vest, as long as service requirements are met. Annual grant levels, vesting provisions and minimum-value guarantees of restricted units for designated participants are recommended by Mr. Craft, subject to review and approval by the compensation committee of our general partner (“Compensation Committee”). The vesting of all restricted units is subject to the satisfaction of certain financial tests. If it is not probable that the financial tests will be achieved for a particular grant of restricted units, any previously expensed amounts for that grant are reversed, and no future expense will be recognized for that grant other than amounts provided for under minimum-value guarantees. Assuming the financial tests are met, restricted units issued to LTIP participants generally cliff vest on January 1st of the third year following the issuance of such restricted units. We expect to settle restricted unit grants by issuing ARLP common units, except for the portion of the restricted units that will satisfy our tax withholding obligations. We account for forfeitures of non-vested restricted unit grants as they occur. As provided under the distribution equivalent rights (“DERs”) provisions of the LTIP and the terms of the restricted unit awards, all currently outstanding non-vested restricted units include contingent rights to receive quarterly distributions in cash or, at the discretion of the Compensation Committee, phantom units in lieu of cash credited to a bookkeeping account with a value equal to the cash distributions we make to unitholders during the vesting period. If it is not probable the financial tests for a particular grant of restricted units will be met, any previously paid DER amounts for that grant are reversed from Partners’ Capital and recorded as compensation expense and any future DERs, for that grant, if any, will be recognized as compensation expense when paid.
​
The fair value of restricted common unit grants under the LTIP are determined on the grant date of the award and recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period. The corresponding liability is classified as equity and included in limited partners’ capital in the consolidated financial statements. 
​
We utilized the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (“SERP”) to provide deferred compensation benefits for certain executive officers. All allocations made to participants under the SERP were made in the form of “phantom” ARLP units. The SERP was administered by the Compensation Committee.
​
Our directors participated in the MGP Amended and Restated Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors (“Directors’ Deferred Compensation Plan”). Pursuant to the Directors’ Deferred Compensation Plan, for amounts deferred either automatically or at the election of the director, a notional account was established and credited with notional common units of ARLP, described in the Directors’ Deferred Compensation Plan as “phantom” units. 
​
For both the SERP and Directors’ Deferred Compensation Plan, when quarterly cash distributions were made with respect to ARLP common units, an amount equal to such quarterly distribution was credited to each participant’s notional account as additional phantom units and recorded as compensation expense. All grants of phantom units under the SERP and Directors’ Deferred Compensation Plan vested immediately. 
​
On December 16, 2024, the SERP and Directors’ Deferred Compensation Plan were terminated, and final distributions of applicable plan accounts were settled in cash. As of December 31, 2024, we had no further obligations under the SERP or the Directors’ Deferred Compensation Plan. 
​
Workers
’ 
Compensation and Pneumoconiosis (Black Lung) Benefits
​
We are liable for workers’ compensation benefits for traumatic injuries and benefits for black lung disease (or pneumoconiosis). Both traumatic claims and pneumoconiosis benefits are covered through our self-insured programs. 
​
We provide income replacement and medical treatment for work-related traumatic injury claims as required by applicable state laws. Workers’ compensation laws also compensate survivors of workers who suffer employment related deaths. Our liability for traumatic injury claims is the estimated present value of current workers’ compensation benefits, based on our actuarial estimates. Our actuarial calculations are based on a blend of actuarial projection methods and numerous assumptions including claim development patterns, mortality, medical costs and interest rates. 
​
110

Table of Contents
Our pneumoconiosis benefits liability is calculated using the service cost method based on the actuarial present value of the estimated pneumoconiosis obligation. Our actuarial calculations are based on numerous assumptions including claim development patterns, medical costs and mortality. Actuarial gains or losses are amortized over the remaining service period of active miners. 
​
Pension Benefits
​
The funded status of our pension benefit plan is recognized separately in our consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or liability. The funded status is the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the plan’s benefit obligation. Pension obligations and net periodic benefit costs are actuarially determined and impacted by various assumptions and estimates including expected return on assets, discount rates, mortality assumptions, employee turnover rates and retirement dates. We evaluate our assumptions periodically and make adjustments to these assumptions and the recorded liability as necessary. 
​
The discount rate is determined for our pension benefit plan based on an approach specific to our plan. The year end discount rate is determined considering a yield curve comprised of high-quality corporate bonds and the timing of the expected benefit cash flows.
​
The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined based on broad equity and bond indices, the investment goals and objectives, the target investment allocation and on the average annual total return for each asset class. 
​
Unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and unrecognized prior service costs and credits are deferred and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss until amortized as a component of net periodic benefit cost. Unrecognized actuarial gains and losses in excess of 
10
% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets are amortized over the participants’ average remaining future years of service. 
​
Asset Retirement Obligations
​
Our coal mining operations are governed by various state statutes and the Federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, which establish reclamation and mine closing standards. These regulations require, among other things, restoration of property in accordance with specified standards and an approved reclamation plan. We record a liability for the fair value of an asset retirement obligation in the period incurred or acquired and a corresponding amount is capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated on a units-of-production basis. As changes in estimates occur (such as mine plan revisions, changes in estimated costs or changes in anticipated timing of reclamation activities), adjustments to the obligation and asset are recognized at the present value of the change in obligation. For locations that have been fully depleted or closed, the present value of the change in obligation is recorded to operating expense. Accretion of the asset retirement obligation is recognized over time and until reclamation obligations are satisfied.
​
Asset retirement obligations primarily relate to mine site reclamation activities, which includes permanently sealing portals at underground mines, reclaiming the final pits for both our underground mines and past surface mines, removing or covering refuse piles and settling ponds, water treatment, and dismantling preparation plants, other facilities and roadway infrastructure. Federal and state laws require bonds to secure our obligations to reclaim lands used for mining and are typically renewed on an annual basis. 
​
Coal Revenue Recognition
​
Revenues from coal supply contracts with customers, which primarily relate to sales of thermal coal, are recognized at the point in time when control of the coal passes to the customer. We have determined that each ton of coal represents a separate and distinct performance obligation. Our coal supply contracts and other revenue contracts vary in length from short-term to long-term sales contracts and do not typically have significant financing components. Transportation revenues represent the fulfillment costs incurred for the services provided to customers through third-party carriers and for which we are directly reimbursed. Other revenues primarily consist of transloading fees, administrative service revenues from our affiliates, mine safety services and products, other coal contract fees and other handling and service fees. Performance obligations under these contracts are typically satisfied upon transfer of control of the goods or services to our customer which is determined by the contract and could be upon shipment or upon delivery. 
​
111

Table of Contents
The estimated transaction price from each of our contracts is based on the total amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to under the contract. Included in the transaction price for certain coal supply contracts is the impact of variable consideration, including quality price adjustments, handling services, government imposition claims, per ton price fluctuations based on certain coal sales price indices and anticipated payments in lieu of shipments. We have constrained the expected value of variable consideration in our estimation of transaction price and only included this consideration to the extent that it is probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur. The estimated transaction price for each contract is allocated to our performance obligations based on relative standalone selling prices determined at contract inception. Variable consideration is allocated to a specific part of the contract in many instances, such as if the variable consideration is based on production activities for coal delivered during a certain period or the outcome of a customer’s ability to accept coal shipments over a certain period. 
​
Contract assets are recorded as trade receivables and reported separately in our consolidated balance sheet from other contract assets as title passes to the customer and our right to consideration becomes unconditional. Payments for coal shipments are typically due within 
two
 to 
four weeks
 of performance. We typically do not have material contract assets that are stated separately from trade receivables as our performance obligations are satisfied as control of the goods or services passes to the customer thereby granting us an unconditional right to receive consideration. Contract liabilities relate to consideration received in advance of the satisfaction of our performance obligations. Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue at the point in time when control of the good or service passes to the customer.
​
Oil & Gas Revenue Recognition
​
Oil & gas royalty revenues are recognized at the point in time when control of the product is transferred to the purchaser by the lessee and collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured. Oil & gas are priced on the delivery date based on prevailing market prices with certain adjustments related to oil quality and physical location. The royalty we receive is tied to a market index, with certain adjustments based on, among other factors, whether a well connects to a gathering or transmission line, quality and heat content of the product, and prevailing supply and demand conditions.
​
We also periodically earn revenue from lease bonuses. We recognize lease bonus revenue when we execute a lease of our mineral interests to exploration and production companies. A lease agreement represents our contract with an operator, which is generally an exploration and production company. The contract will (a) generally transfer the rights to any oil or gas discovered, (b) grant us a right to a specified royalty interest from the operator, and (c) require the operator to commence drilling and complete operations within a specified time period. Control of the minerals transfers to the operator when the lease agreement is executed. At the time we execute the lease agreement, we expect to receive the lease bonus payment within a reasonable time, though in no case more than one year, such that we do not adjust the expected amount of consideration for the effects of any significant financing component. 
​
As a non-operator, we have limited visibility into the timing of when new wells start producing. In addition, production statements may not be received for 30 to 90 days or more after the date production is delivered. As a result, we are required to estimate the amount of production delivered to the purchaser and the price that will be received for the sale of the product. The expected sales volumes and prices from our properties are estimated and recorded within the 
Trade receivables
 line item in our consolidated balance sheets. The difference between our estimates and the actual amounts received for oil & gas royalty revenue are immaterial and recorded in the month that payment is received from the third-party purchaser unless new production information is received prior to the payment allowing us to update the estimate recorded.
​
Income Taxes
​
We are not a taxable entity for federal or state income tax purposes; the tax effect of our activities accrues to our unitholders. Although publicly traded partnerships as a general rule are taxed as corporations, we qualify for an exemption because at least 90% of our income consists of qualifying income, as defined in Section 7704(c) of the Internal Revenue Code. Net income for financial statement purposes may differ significantly from taxable income reportable to unitholders as a result of differences between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities and the taxable income allocation requirements under our partnership agreement. Individual unitholders have different investment bases depending upon the timing and price of acquisition of their partnership units. Furthermore, each unitholder’s tax accounting, which is partially dependent upon the unitholder’s tax position, differs from the accounting followed in our consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, the aggregate difference in the basis of our net assets for financial and tax 
112

Table of Contents
reporting purposes cannot be readily determined because information regarding each unitholder’s tax attributes in our partnership is not available to us. 
​
Our subsidiary Alliance Minerals within our Oil & Gas Royalties segment and certain other subsidiaries within our Other, Corporate and Elimination category are subject to federal and state income taxes. We use the liability method of accounting for income taxes, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of (i) temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities and (ii) operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on enacted rates applicable to the future period when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax status or a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the period the change in status is elected or rate change is enacted. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 
​
New Accounting Standards Issued and Adopted
​
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
 (“ASU 2023-07”). ASU 2023-07 primarily requires enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), the amount and composition of other segment items, and the title and position of the CODM. We adopted ASU 2023-07 beginning with our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. The adoption of ASU 2023-07 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements but did change the presentation of the results of our reportable segments. See Note 25 – Segment Information. 
​
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-08, 
Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60) 
(“ASU 2023-08”), which requires an entity to measure certain digital assets at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized in net income. In addition, the guidance requires additional disclosures related to digital assets once adopted. We adopted ASU 2023-08, effective January 1, 2024, which resulted in a cumulative-effect adjustment to increase the opening balance of Partners’ Capital by $
6.2
 million. See Note 6 – Digital Assets for more information on our digital assets.
​
New Accounting Standards Issued and Not Yet Adopted
​
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
 (“ASU 2023-09”). ASU 2023-09 primarily requires enhanced disclosures to (1) disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation, (2) disclose the amount of income taxes paid and expensed disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign taxes, with further disaggregation by individual jurisdictions if certain criteria are met, and (3) disclose income (loss) from continuing operations before income tax (benefit) disaggregated between domestic and foreign. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2023-09. We do not expect ASU 2023-09 to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements but could result in additional disclosure.

​
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03,
 Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40
) (“ASU 2024-03”). ASU 2024-03 requires the disclosure of additional information about specific expense categories in the notes to the financial statements to provide enhanced transparency into the nature and function of expenses. ASU 2024-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact ASU 2024-03 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES
​
AllDale I & II and Cavalier Minerals
​
We own the general partner interests and, including the limited partner interests we hold through our ownership in Cavalier Minerals JV, LLC (“Cavalier Minerals”), approximately 
97
% of the limited partner interests in AllDale Minerals LP (“AllDale I”) and AllDale Minerals II, LP (“AllDale II”, and collectively with AllDale I, “AllDale I & II”). As the general partner of AllDale I & II, we are entitled to receive 
20.0
% of all distributions from AllDale I & II with the remaining 
80.0
% allocated to limited partners based upon ownership percentages.
113

Table of Contents
​
Cavalier Minerals owns approximately 
72
% of the limited partner interests in AllDale I & II. We own the managing member interest and a 
96
% member interest in Cavalier Minerals. Bluegrass Minerals Management, LLC (“Bluegrass Minerals”) owns a 
4
% member interest in Cavalier Minerals and a profits interest which entitles it to receive distributions equal to 
25
% of all distributions (including in liquidation) after all members have recovered their investment. All members have recovered their investment and Bluegrass Minerals began receiving its profits interest distributions in late 2022. 
​
We have concluded that AllDale I, AllDale II and Cavalier Minerals are VIEs which we consolidate as the primary beneficiary because we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of AllDale I, AllDale II and Cavalier Minerals in addition to having substantial equity ownership.
​
Our share of Cavalier Minerals’ investment in AllDale I & II is eliminated in consolidation and Bluegrass Minerals’ investment in Cavalier Minerals is accounted for as noncontrolling ownership interest in our consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, earnings attributable to Bluegrass Minerals are recognized as noncontrolling interest in our consolidated statements of income. 
​
The following table presents the carrying amounts and classification of AllDale I & II’s assets and liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheets:

AllDale III
​
AllDale III owns oil & gas mineral interests in areas around the oil & gas mineral interests we own. Alliance Minerals owns a 
13.9
% limited partner interest in AllDale III. Alliance Minerals’ investment in AllDale III is subject to a 
25
% profits interest for the general partner that is subject to a return hurdle equal to the greater of 
125
% of cumulative capital contributions and a 
10
% internal rate of return, and following an 80/20 “catch-up” provision for the general partner. 
​
We have concluded that AllDale III is a VIE that we do not consolidate. AllDale III is structured as a limited partnership with the limited partners (1) not having the ability to remove the general partner and (2) not participating significantly in the operational decisions. We are not the primary beneficiary of AllDale III because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact AllDale III’s economic performance. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our investment in AllDale III was $
22.5
 million.
​
Francis
​
On April 5, 2022, we invested $
20
 million in Francis, in the form of a convertible note. Our convertible note matured on April 1, 2023 and was converted into a preferred equity interest in Francis. Prior to conversion, we had determined the note more closely represented equity as opposed to debt. Therefore, we accounted for the convertible note as an equity contribution even though we did not participate in Francis’ earnings or losses and were not eligible to receive distributions during the term of the note. Subsequent to the conversion on April 1, 2023, we participate in earnings and losses and are eligible to receive distributions. As of December 31, 2024, we held approximately 
16.7
% of Francis’ equity. 
​
We have concluded that Francis is a VIE that we do not consolidate. Francis’ management structure is similar to a limited partnership with the non-managing members (i) not having the ability to remove the managing member and (ii) not participating significantly in the operational decisions. We are not the primary beneficiary of Francis because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact Francis’s economic performance. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our investment in Francis was $
4.3
 million.

ACQUISITION
S
​
Belvedere
​
On September 9, 2022 (the “Belvedere Acquisition Date”), we acquired approximately 
394
 oil & gas net royalty acres in the Delaware Basin from Belvedere for a cash purchase price of $
11.4
 million, which was funded with cash on hand. This acquisition gives us additional exposure to a productive area of the Delaware Basin and is within close proximity to reserves that we currently own. Because the mineral interests acquired in the Belvedere Acquisition include royalty interests in both developed properties and undeveloped properties with different risk profiles, we have determined that the acquisition should be accounted for as a business combination and the underlying assets should be recorded at fair value as of the Belvedere Acquisition Date on our consolidated balance sheet. 
​
The following table summarizes the fair value allocation of assets acquired as of the Belvedere Acquisition Date:

Certain assumptions used are not observable in active markets; therefore, the fair value measurements represent Level 3 fair value measurements.

Jase
​
On October 26, 2022 (the “Jase Acquisition Date”), we acquired approximately 
3,928
 oil & gas net royalty acres in the Midland and Delaware Basins from Jase for a cash purchase price of $
81.2
 million which was funded with cash on hand. This acquisition further enhanced our ownership position in the Permian Basin. Because the mineral interests acquired in the Jase Acquisition include royalty interests in both developed properties and undeveloped properties with different risk profiles, we have determined that the acquisition should be accounted for as a business combination and the underlying assets should be recorded at fair value as of the Jase Acquisition Date on our consolidated balance sheet.

The fair value of the receivables was determined using estimated production during the period between the Jase Acquisition Date and the effective date of the agreement and observable sales prices during the period. Certain assumptions used are not observable in active markets; therefore, the fair value measurements represent Level 3 fair value measurements.

JC Resources
​
On February 22, 2023, we completed the JC Resources Acquisition, which gives us increased exposure to a prolific area of the Delaware Basin that is within close proximity to reserves that we currently own. This acquisition was approved by the conflicts committee of MGP’s board of directors, which is comprised entirely of independent directors. Because JC Resources is under common control with us, we recorded the acquisition at JC Resources’ carrying value for each period presented. The carrying value of the mineral interests as well as related receivables and payables at February 22, 2023 was $
65.0
 million inclusive of $
25.4
 million and $
37.8
 million of mineral interests in proved and unproved properties, respectively. 
​
Acquisition Agreement
​
During 2023 and 2024, we were party to a collaborative agreement with a third party for the acquisition of oil & gas mineral interests in the Midland and Delaware Basins. Under the agreement, the third party assists us in the identification, evaluation, and acquisition of target oil & gas mineral interests. In exchange for these services, the third party receives a participation share, partially funded by the third party, and is paid a periodic management fee. Pursuant to this agreement, we purchased $
5.8
 million and $
10.7
 million of oil & gas mineral interests in proved and unproved properties, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2024 and $
6.5
 million and $
6.7
 million in proved and unproved properties, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2023. Management fees paid under this agreement have been immaterial. 
​
Skyland Acquisition
​
On December 7, 2023 (the “Skyland Acquisition Date”), we acquired approximately 
2,372
 oil & gas net royalty acres in the Anadarko, Williston and Delaware Basins from Skyland and Haymaker for a cash purchase price of $
14.5
 million which was funded with cash on hand. This acquisition further enhanced our ownership position in these basins. Because the mineral interests acquired in the Skyland Acquisition include royalty interests in both developed properties and undeveloped properties with different risk profiles, we have determined that the acquisition should be accounted for as a business combination and the underlying assets should be recorded at fair value as of the Skyland Acquisition Date on our consolidated balance sheet.

The carrying amounts for cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities, approximate fair value due to the short maturity of those instruments.
​
The fair value of our digital assets is based on an exchange quoted price. See Note 7 – Digital Assets for more information on our digital assets.
​
The fair value measurement of our contingent consideration liability is determined using an option approach methodology simulation based on significant inputs not observable in active markets representing a Level 3 fair value measurement under the fair value hierarchy. Our contingent consideration liability is associated with our acquisition of 
118

Table of Contents
our Hamilton mine in 2015 wherein we agreed to pay the seller additional consideration for the acquisition if the average quarterly sales price exceeds a defined threshold price in any future quarters subject to a maximum of $
110.0
 million reduced for any payments made under an overriding royalty agreement with the sellers relating to mineral interests controlled by our Hamilton mine. We have paid $
9.6
 million under this contingent consideration agreement and nothing under the overriding royalty agreement as of December 31, 2024.  
​
The estimated fair value of our long-term debt, including current maturities, is based on interest rates that we believe are currently available to us in active markets for issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. See Note 12 – Long-Term Debt for additional information on our long-term debt. 
​
Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements
​
Our option approach methodology simulation generates an expected payment for each quarter in Hamilton’s mine life by using proprietary internal estimates of our uncommitted coal sales prices and generating a simulated uncommitted coal sales price by applying unobservable inputs through a million simulations. This simulated coal sales price is then used in a calculation of the expected future payments using our proprietary committed coal sales prices and production for each quarter. We then calculate the present value of the estimated future payments. The following table presents quantitative information about certain significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement for our contingent consideration liability. The use of significant unobservable inputs results in uncertainty as of the reporting date, as changes in these unobservable inputs could significantly raise or lower the estimated fair value.

The above balances reflect lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments of $
24.6
 million to our coal inventories. These adjustments are a result of lower coal sale prices and higher cost per ton primarily due to a longwall move at the Hamilton County Coal, LLC (“Hamilton”) mining complex, lower production at Mettiki Coal , LLC and Mettiki Coal (WV), LLC (collectively “Mettiki”) and MC Mining, LLC (“MC Mining”) mining complexes, and ongoing development activities at the Henderson County mine at our River View Coal, LLC (“River View”) mining complex.
​
Certain of our subsidiaries, primarily consisting of Matrix Design Group, LLC, its subsidiaries, and Alliance Design Group, LLC (collectively referred to as “Matrix Group”), manufacture a variety of products for our mining operations and third parties. Historically, these products were primarily consumed by our mining operations with the associated inventory presented as supplies inventory. Recently Matrix Group has been increasing its sales to third-parties. As a result, we have presented our manufactured goods inventories in the table above separately from our historical presentation of supplies inventory.

All of our property, plant and equipment have depreciable lives of

. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense related to property, plant and equipment was $
287.1
 million, $
276.4
 million and $
273.8
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
​
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, land and coal mineral rights above include $
14.1
 million and $
13.4
 million, respectively, of carrying value associated with coal mineral reserves and resources attributable to properties where we or a third party to which we lease coal mineral reserves and resources are not currently engaged in mining operations or leasing to third parties, and therefore, the coal mineral reserves are not currently being depleted. We believe that the carrying value of these coal mineral reserves will be recovered. 
​
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, our oil & gas mineral interests noted in the table above include the carrying value of our unproved oil & gas mineral interests totaling $
377.5
 million and $
411.6
 million, respectively. We generally do not record depletion expense for our unproved oil & gas mineral interests; however, we do review for impairment as needed throughout the year. 
​
We incurred $
67.2
 million and $
44.4
 million in mine development costs, primarily related to Tunnel Ridge, LLC (“Tunnel Ridge”) mining complex and the Henderson County mine at River View for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 respectively. All past capitalized mine development costs are associated with other mines that shifted to the production phase in past years and we are amortizing these costs accordingly. We believe that the carrying value of the past development costs will be recovered.
​
9.
LONG-LIVED ASSET IMPAIRMENTS
​
On November 15, 2024, we issued Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notices to the employees of our MC Mining, LLC (“MC Mining”) mining complex, which is primarily included in our Appalachia Coal Operations reportable segment. The notices were issued primarily in response to market uncertainty, challenging geology and higher costs which has led to the decision to reduce production at the mine. Accordingly, we adjusted the carrying value of MC Mining’s assets from $
101.3
 million to its fair value of $
70.2
 million resulting in an impairment charge of $
31.1
 million.
​
The fair value of the impaired assets was determined using a cost replacement approach, which represents a Level 3 fair value measurement under the fair value hierarchy. The fair value analysis used quoted prices obtained from external sources as adjusted to account for the remaining useful life of the assets.

​
Infinitum
​
During 2022, we purchased $
42.0
 million of Series D Preferred Stock in Infinitum, a Texas-based startup developer and manufacturer of electric motors featuring printed circuit board stators. On September 8, 2023, we purchased $
24.6
 million of Series E Preferred Stock in Infinitum. The Infinitum Preferred Stock provides for non-cumulative dividends when and if declared by Infinitum’s board of directors. Each share of Infinitum Preferred Stock is convertible, at any time, at our option, into shares of common stock of Infinitum. We account for our ownership interest in Infinitum as an equity investment without a readily determinable fair value. Absent an observable price change, it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of our investment in Infinitum because of the lack of a quoted market price for our ownership interests. Therefore, we use a measurement alternative other than fair value to account for our investment. 
​
Ascend
​
On August 22, 2023, we purchased $
25.0
 million of Ascend Preferred Stock in Ascend, a U.S.-based manufacturer and recycler of sustainable, engineered battery materials for electric vehicles. The Ascend Preferred Stock provides for non-cumulative dividends when and if declared by Ascend’s board of directors. Each share is convertible, at any time, at our option, into shares of common stock of Ascend. We account for our ownership interest in Ascend as an equity investment without a readily determinable fair value. Absent an observable price change, it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of our investment in Ascend because of the lack of a quoted market price for our ownership interests. Therefore, we use a measurement alternative other than fair value to account for our investment.

Credit Facility
​
On January 13, 2023, Alliance Coal, as borrower, entered into a Credit Agreement with various financial institutions which was amended on June 12, 2024 (the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement provides for a $
425.0
 million revolving credit facility which includes a sublimit of $
15.0
 million for swingline borrowings and permits the issuance of letters of credit up to the full amount of the Credit Facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), and for a term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $
75.0
 million (the “Term Loan”). The Revolving Credit Facility also includes an incremental facility providing for an increase of $
100.0
 million at our option subject to lenders agreeing to participate in such incremental facility. The Credit Agreement matures on March 9, 2028, at which time the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Revolving Credit Facility advances and all Term Loan advances are required to be repaid in full. Interest is payable quarterly, with principal on the Term Loan due in quarterly installments equal to 
6.25
% of the outstanding balance of the Term Loan on the Credit Agreement amendment date beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 2024. We incurred debt issuance costs during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 of $
1.8
 million and $
12.4
 million, respectively, in connection with the Credit Agreement. These debt issuance costs are deferred and amortized as a component of interest expense over the term of the Revolving Credit Facility.

The Credit Agreement is guaranteed by ARLP and certain of its subsidiaries, including the Intermediate Partnership and most of the direct and indirect subsidiaries of Alliance Coal (the “Subsidiary Guarantors”). The Credit Agreement also is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Subsidiary Guarantors and Alliance Coal. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at our option, at either (i) an adjusted one-month, three-month or six-month term rate based on the secured overnight financing rate published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus the applicable margin or (ii) the base rate plus the applicable margin. The base rate is the highest of (i) the Overnight Bank Funding Rate plus 
0.50
%, (ii) the Administrative Agent’s prime rate, and (iii) the Daily Simple Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 
100
 basis points. The applicable margin for borrowings under the Credit Agreement are determined by reference to the Consolidated Debt to Consolidated Cash Flow Ratio. For borrowings under the Term Loan, we elected the one-month term rate, with applicable margin, which was 
7.71
% as of December 31, 2024. At December 31, 2024, we had $
41.0
 million of letters of credit outstanding with $
384.0
 million available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility. We incur an annual commitment fee of 
0.50
% on the undrawn portion of the Revolving Credit Facility. We utilize the Credit Agreement, as appropriate, for working capital requirements, capital expenditures and investments, scheduled debt payments and distribution payments.
​
The Credit Agreement contains various restrictions affecting Alliance Coal and its subsidiaries, including, among other things, restrictions on incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens, sale of assets, investments, mergers and consolidations and transactions with affiliates. In each case, these restrictions are subject to various exceptions. In addition, restrictions apply to cash distributions by Alliance Coal to the Intermediate Partnership if such distribution would result in exceeding the debt of Alliance Coal to cash flow ratio (as determined in the Credit Agreement) being more than 
1.0
 to 1.0 or in Alliance Coal having liquidity of less than $
200
 million. The Credit Agreement requires us to maintain (a) a debt of Alliance Coal to cash flow ratio of not more than 
1.5
 to 1.0, (b) a consolidated debt of Alliance Coal and the Intermediate Partnership to cash flow ratio of not more than 
2.5
 to 1.0 and (c) an interest coverage ratio of not less than 
3.0
 to 1.0, in each case, during the four most recently ended fiscal quarters. The debt of Alliance Coal to cash flow ratio, consolidated debt of Alliance Coal and the Intermediate Partnership to cash flow ratio, and interest coverage ratio were 
0.17
 to 1.0, 
0.91
 to 1.0 and 
37.97
 to 1.0, respectively, for the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2024. We were in compliance with the covenants of the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2024 and anticipate remaining in compliance with the covenants.

​
Net restricted assets, as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, refers to the amount of our consolidated subsidiaries’ net assets for which the ability to transfer funds to ARLP in the form of cash dividends, loans, advances, or transfers is restricted. As a result of the restrictions contained in the Credit Facility and its associated compliance ratios, the amount of our net restricted assets at December 31, 2024 was $
649.2
 million. 
​
8.625% Senior Notes due 2029
​
On June 12, 2024, the Intermediate Partnership and Alliance Resource Finance Corporation (as co-issuer), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Intermediate Partnership (“Alliance Finance”), issued an aggregate principal amount of $
400.0
 million of senior unsecured notes due 2029 (the “2029 Senior Notes”) in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers. The 2029 Senior Notes have a term of 
five years
, maturing on June 15, 2029 and accrue interest at an annual rate of 
8.625
%. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on each June 15 and December 15. The 2029 Senior Notes are guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by ARLP, certain of ARLP’s wholly owned oil and gas and coal royalties subsidiaries and each of ARLP’s subsidiaries that guarantee obligations under the Credit Agreement. The indenture governing the 2029 Senior Notes contains customary terms, events of default and covenants relating to, among other things, the incurrence of debt, the payment of distributions or similar restricted payments, undertaking transactions with affiliates and limitations on asset sales. 
​
At any time prior to June 15, 2026, the issuers may redeem up to 
35
% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 
108.625
% of the principal amount redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, with an amount of cash not greater than the net proceeds from one or more equity offerings. The issuers may also redeem all or a part of the 2029 Senior Notes at any time on or after June 15, 2026, at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. At any time prior to June 15, 2026, the issuers may redeem the 2029 Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to the principal amount plus a “make-whole” premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.
​

Table of Contents
In addition, if prior to June 15, 2026, a Specified Minerals Disposition (as defined in the indenture governing the 2029 Senior Notes and which involves oil and gas mineral interests) occurs, the issuers will be required to make an offer to purchase up to 
40
% of the aggregate principal amount of 2029 Senior Notes then outstanding at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to 
108.625
% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase. We incurred debt issuance costs during the year ended December 31, 2024 of $
9.7
 million in connection with the 2029 Senior Notes. These debt issuance costs are deferred and amortized as a component of interest expense over the term of the 2029 Senior Notes.
​
7.5% Senior Notes due 2025
​
On April 24, 2017, the Intermediate Partnership and Alliance Finance (as co-issuer) issued an aggregate principal amount of $
400.0
 million of senior unsecured notes due 2025 in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers. The 7.5% Senior Notes due 2025 had a term of 
eight years
, maturing on May 1, 2025 and accrued interest at an annual rate of 
7.5
%. In June 2024, we used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering of the 2029 Senior Notes to redeem the outstanding balance of the 7.5% Senior Notes due 2025.
​
Accounts Receivable Securitization
​
Certain direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of our Intermediate Partnership were party to a $
90.0
 million accounts receivable securitization facility (“Securitization Facility”) that was scheduled to mature in January 2025. Under the Securitization Facility, certain subsidiaries sell certain trade receivables on an ongoing basis to our Intermediate Partnership, which then sells the trade receivables to AROP Funding, LLC (“AROP Funding”), a wholly owned bankruptcy-remote special purpose subsidiary of our Intermediate Partnership, which in turn borrows on a revolving basis up to $
90.0
 million secured by the trade receivables. After the sale, Alliance Coal, as servicer of the assets, collects the receivables on behalf of AROP Funding. The Securitization Facility bears interest based on a short-term bank yield index. On December 31, 2024, we had $
14.8
 million of letters of credit outstanding with $
73.0
 million available for borrowing under the Securitization Facility. The agreement governing the Securitization Facility contains customary terms and conditions, including limitations with regards to certain customer credit ratings. In January 2025, we extended the term of the Securitization Facility to January 2026 and decreased the borrowing availability under the facility up to $
75.0
 million. At December 31, 2024, we did 
no
t have any outstanding borrowings under the Securitization Facility.
​
June 2020 Equipment Financing
​
On June 5, 2020, the Intermediate Partnership entered into an equipment financing arrangement accounted for as debt, wherein the Intermediate Partnership received $
14.7
 million in exchange for conveying its interest in certain equipment owned indirectly by the Intermediate Partnership and entering into a master lease agreement for that equipment (the “June 2020 Equipment Financing”). The June 2020 Equipment Financing contained customary terms and events of default and provided for 
forty-eight month
ly payments with an implicit interest rate of 
6.1
%. The June 2020 Equipment Financing matured on June 5, 2024 and the equipment reverted back to the Intermediate Partnership. 
​
February 2024 Equipment Financing
​
On February 28, 2024, Alliance Coal entered into an equipment financing arrangement accounted for as debt, wherein Alliance Coal received $
54.6
 million in exchange for conveying its interest in certain equipment owned indirectly by Alliance Coal and entering into a master lease agreement for that equipment (the “February 2024 Equipment Financing”). The February 2024 Equipment Financing contains customary terms and events of default and provides for 
forty-eight month
ly payments with an implicit interest rate of 
8.29
%, maturing on February 28, 2028. Upon maturity, the equipment will revert to Alliance Coal. 
​
Other
​
We also have an agreement with a bank to provide additional letters of credit in an amount of $
5.0
 million to maintain surety bonds to secure certain asset retirement obligations and our obligations for workers’ compensation benefits. At December 31, 2024, we had $
5.0
 million in letters of credit outstanding under this agreement.

The discount rate used to calculate the estimated present value of future obligations for workers’ compensation was 
5.17
% and 
4.66
% at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
​
The valuation gain in 2024 was primarily attributable to a favorable change in claims development and an increase in the discount rate used to calculate the estimated present value of the future obligations. The valuation gain in 2023 was primarily attributable to a favorable change in claims development partially offset by a decrease in the discount rate used to calculate the estimated present value of the future obligations.
​
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $
106.8
 million and $
99.4
 million, respectively, in surety bonds and letters of credit outstanding to secure workers’ compensation obligations.
​
We limit our exposure to traumatic injury claims by purchasing a high deductible insurance policy that starts paying benefits after deductibles for the particular claim year have been met. Our workers’ compensation liability above is presented on a gross basis and does not include our expected receivables on our insurance policy. Our receivables for traumatic injury claims under this policy as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $
3.7
 million and $
4.1
 million, respectively. Our receivables are included in 
Other long-term assets

The actuarial gain component of the change in benefit obligations in 2024 was primarily attributable to a) favorable changes in the discount rate, b) favorable demographics in the at-risk population, and c) favorable assumption changes related to Federal and State benefit levels. These favorable changes were partially offset by unfavorable assumption changes regarding future average medical benefits and adjustment based on new hires or re-hires. The actuarial loss component of the change in benefit obligations in 2023 was primarily attributable to a) unfavorable changes in the discount rate, b) unfavorable demographics in the at-risk population, c) unfavorable black lung claims experience, d) unfavorable assumption changes regarding future average medical benefits, and e) unfavorable assumption changes related to Federal and State benefit levels.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
​
Defined Contribution Plans
​
All regular full-time employees are eligible to participate in a defined contribution profit sharing and savings plan (“PSSP”) that we sponsor. PSSP participants may elect to make voluntary contributions to this plan up to a specified amount of their compensation. We make matching contributions based on a percent of an employee’s eligible compensation and also make an additional non-matching contribution. Our contribution expense for the PSSP was approximately $
25.5
 million, $
21.8
 million and $
19.4
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
​
Defined Benefit Plan
​
Eligible employees and former employees of certain of our mining operations participate in a defined benefit plan (the “Pension Plan”) that we sponsor. The Pension Plan is closed to new applicants. Participants in the Pension Plan are no longer receiving benefit accruals for service. The benefit formula for the Pension Plan is a fixed-dollar unit based on years of service.

The Compensation Committee has appointed an investment manager with full investment authority with respect to Pension Plan investments subject to investment guidelines and compliance with Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or other applicable laws. The investment manager employs an asset allocation strategy through investment in certain investment types such as equity securities and fixed income securities. The asset allocation process provides that the total portfolio allocation will be adjusted as the funded ratio of the plan changes and market conditions warrant, consistent with managing risks in accordance with plan objectives and time horizon. As the funded ratio improves, more assets may be allocated to the core fixed income portfolio to reduce volatility. The objective of the allocation policy is to

achieve an average annual return greater than the actuarial discount rate over the specified time horizon. General asset allocation guidelines at December 31, 2024 are as follows:

Equity investments - Individual securities include investments in publicly traded common stock

and American Depository Receipts. Publicly traded common stocks are traded on a national securities exchange and investments in common stocks are valued using quoted market prices multiplied by the number of shares owned.

American Depository Receipts are negotiable securities issued by a bank representing shares in a foreign company and traded on a national securities exchange.
(b)
Fixed income - investments include investments in preferred stock, mutual funds and exchange traded funds that are traded on a national securities exchange and valued using quoted market prices multiplied by the number of shares owned.
(c)
Equity investments - Mutual funds are valued daily in actively traded markets. For purposes of calculating the value, portfolio securities and other assets for which market quotes are readily available are valued at market value. 
132

Table of Contents
Investments initially valued in currencies other than the U.S. dollars are converted to the U.S. dollar using exchange rates obtained from pricing services.
(d)
Equity investments – Exchange traded funds are funds that own financial assets and trade on exchanges, generally tracking a specific index. Investments in exchange traded funds are valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices.
(e)
Accrued income represents dividends or interest declared, but not received, on equity securities owned at December 31, 2024.
(f)
Investments measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) have not been classified within the fair value hierarchy. The fair values of all commingled investment funds are determined based on the net asset values per unit of each of the funds. The net asset values per unit represent the aggregate value of the fund’s assets at fair value less liabilities, divided by the number of units outstanding

For the year ended December 31, 2024, the allocation of liability associated with mine development and change in assumptions increased by $
5.6
 million. The increase was largely attributable to higher cost assumptions.
​
For the year ended December 31, 2023, the allocation of liability associated with mine development and change in assumptions decreased by $
1.5
 million. The decrease was largely attributable to lower cost assumptions.
​
The impact of discounting our estimated cash flows resulted in reducing the accrual for asset retirement obligations by $
120.1
 million and $
116.2
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Estimated payments of asset retirement obligations as of December 31, 2024 are as follows:

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
​
Commitments
​
We lease buildings and equipment under operating lease agreements that provide for the payment of both minimum and contingent rentals. We also have noncancelable coal mineral reserve and resource leases as discussed in Note 21 – Related-Party Transactions. We have contractual commitments of approximately $
140.7
 million at December 31, 2024.
​
General Litigation
​
Certain of our subsidiaries are party to litigation in which the plaintiffs allege violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and state law due to alleged failure to compensate for time “donning” and “doffing” equipment and to account for certain bonuses in the calculation of overtime rates and pay. The plaintiffs in these cases sought class and collective action certification, which we opposed. In April 2024, we entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs pursuant to which we agreed to settle such litigation for $
15.3
 million. As a result of reaching this settlement, which is subject to and awaiting court approval, we have accrued $
15.3
 million as of December 31, 2024. Our $
15.3
 million accrual is included in the 
Other current liabilities 
line item on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. We believe our ultimate exposure, if any should litigation resume, will not be material to our results of operations or financial position; however, if our current belief as to the merit of the claims is not upheld if litigation were to resume, it is reasonably possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters could result in a potential loss that may be material to our results of operations.
​
We also have various other lawsuits, claims and regulatory proceedings incidental to our business that are pending against the ARLP Partnership. We record an accrual for a potential loss related to these matters when, in management’s opinion, such loss is probable and reasonably estimable. Based on known facts and circumstances, we believe the ultimate outcome of these outstanding lawsuits, claims and regulatory proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, if the results of these matters are different from management’s current expectations and in amounts greater than our accruals (if any), such matters could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.
​
Other
​
Effective October 1, 2024, we renewed our property and casualty insurance program through September 30, 2025. Our property insurance was procured from our wholly owned captive insurance company, Wildcat Insurance, LLC (“Wildcat Insurance”). Wildcat Insurance charged certain of our subsidiaries for the premiums on this program and in return purchased reinsurance for the program in the standard market. The maximum limit in the commercial property program is $
100.0
 million per occurrence, excluding a $
1.5
 million deductible for property damage, a 
75
- or 
90-day
 waiting period for underground business interruption depending on the mining complex and an additional $
25.0
 million overall aggregate deductible. We retained a 
2.50
% participating interest in our current commercial property insurance program. We can make no assurances that we will not experience significant insurance claims in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to purchase property insurance in the future. Also, exposures exist for which no insurance may be available and for which we have not reserved. In addition, the insurance industry has been subject to efforts by environmental activists to restrict coverages available for fossil-fuel companies.

PARTNERS’ CAPITAL
​
Distributions
​
Our available cash that is not used for unit repurchases may, at the discretion of our general partner, be distributed within 
45 days
 after the end of each quarter to unitholders of record. Available cash is generally defined in the partnership agreement as all cash and cash equivalents on hand at the end of each quarter less reserves established by MGP in its reasonable discretion for future cash requirements. These reserves are retained to provide for the conduct of our business, the payment of debt principal and interest and to provide funds for future distributions. The following table summarizes the quarterly per unit distribution paid during each quarter of 2022 through 2024:

Unit Repurchase Program
​
In January 2023, the board of directors of MGP authorized a $
93.5
 million increase to the unit repurchase program, which had $
6.5
 million of available capacity as of December 31, 2022. As a result, we were authorized to repurchase up to a total of $
100.0
 million of ARLP common units. The program has no time limit and we may repurchase units from time to time in the open market or in other privately negotiated transactions. The unit repurchase program authorization does not obligate us to repurchase any dollar amount or number of units. 
No
 units were repurchased during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we repurchased and retired 
929,842
 units at an average unit price of $
20.90
 for an aggregate purchase price of $
19.4
 million, leaving $
80.6
 million remaining under the current authorization. Since inception of the unit repurchase program, we have repurchased and retired 
6,390,446
 units at an average unit price of $
17.67
 for an aggregate purchase price of $
112.9
 million.

During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we issued 
936,544
 and 
860,060
 unrestricted common units, respectively, to the LTIP participants. The remaining vested units were settled in cash to satisfy tax withholding obligations.
​
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, our LTIP expense for grants of restricted units was $
8.3
 million, $
10.4

9.4
 million, respectively. The total obligation associated with LTIP grants of restricted units as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $
16.9
 million and $
19.5
 million, respectively, and is included in the partners’ capital 
Limited partners-common unitholders
 line item in our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2024, there was $

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK AND MAJOR CUSTOMERS
​
The international coal market has been a part of our business with indirect sales to end-users in Europe, Africa, Asia, North America and South America. Our sales into the international coal market are considered exports and are made through brokered transactions. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, export tons represented approximately 
17.3
%, 
15.7
% and 
12.5
% of tons sold, respectively. 
​
137

Table of Contents
Because title to our export shipments typically transfers to our brokerage customers at a point that does not necessarily reflect the end-usage point, we attribute export tons to the country with the end-usage point, if known. No individual country was attributed greater than 10% of total domestic and export tons sold during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. 
​
We have significant long-term coal supply agreements, some of which contain prospective price adjustment provisions designed to reflect changes in market conditions, labor and other production costs and, in the infrequent circumstance when the coal is sold other than free on board the mine, changes in transportation rates. A major customer is defined as a customer from which we derive at least 10% of our total revenues, including transportation revenues. Total revenues from major customers are as follows:

 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our credit loss experience has historically been insignificant. Financial conditions of our customers could result in a material change to our credit loss expense in future periods. The coal supply agreements with Customers A, B and C expire in 2025, 2030 and 2029, respectively.

RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS
​
We have continuing related-party transactions with MGP and its affiliates. The Board of Directors and its conflicts committee (“Conflicts Committee”) review our related-party transactions that involve a potential conflict of interest between our general partner or its affiliates and ARLP or its subsidiaries or any other partner of ARLP to determine that such transactions are fair and reasonable to ARLP. As a result of these reviews, the Board of Directors and the Conflicts Committee approved each of the transactions described below that had such potential conflict of interest as fair and reasonable to ARLP.

Craft Foundations
​
In January 2005, we acquired Tunnel Ridge from ARH. In connection with this acquisition, we assumed a coal lease with Alliance Resource GP, LLC, an entity indirectly wholly owned by Mr. Craft and Kathleen S. Craft until it was dissolved in December 2020. In December 2018, the property subject to the lease was transferred to the Joseph W. Craft III Foundation and the Kathleen S. Craft Foundation, which each hold an undivided 
one
-
half
 interest (the “Craft Foundations”). Under the terms of the lease, Tunnel Ridge is required to pay an annual minimum royalty of $
3.0
 million. The lease expires the earlier of January 1, 2033 or upon the exhaustion of the mineable and merchantable leased coal. Tunnel Ridge incurred $
9.4
 million, $
12.1
 million and $
12.3
 million in earned royalties in 2024, 2023 and 2022 respectively. 
​
Tunnel Ridge has a surface land lease with an annual payment of $
0.2
 million, payable in January of each year with the Craft Foundations.
​
WKY CoalPlay
​
In February 2015, WKY CoalPlay, LLC (“WKY CoalPlay”), an entity owned by the Craft Foundations and two limited liability companies owned by irrevocable trusts established by Mr. Craft and his children, entered into a coal lease agreement with Alliance Resource Properties regarding coal mineral resources located in Henderson and Union Counties, Kentucky. The lease has an initial term of 
20 years
 and provides for earned royalty payments to WKY CoalPlay of 
4.0
% of the coal sales price and annual minimum royalty payments of $
2.1
 million. All annual minimum royalty payments are recoupable from future earned royalties. 
​
In December 2014, WKY CoalPlay’s subsidiaries, Towhead Coal Reserves, LLC and Henderson Coal Reserves, LLC entered into coal lease agreements with Alliance Resource Properties. The leases have initial terms of 
20 years
 and provide for earned royalty payments of 
4.0
% of the coal sales price and annual minimum royalty payments of $
3.6
 million and $
2.5
 million, respectively. All annual minimum royalty payments under each agreement are recoupable from future earned royalties payable under that agreement.

Alliance Minerals’ Tax Election resulted in the recognition of an initial deferred tax liability of $
37.3
 million with a corresponding increase to income tax expense and reduction of net income for the year ended December 31, 2022. Recognition of the initial deferred tax liability and expense is primarily the result of the $
177.0
 million non-cash acquisition gain recognized in 2019 related to the acquisition of the remaining interests in AllDale I & II (the “Acquisition Gain”). The Acquisition Gain was recognized to step up to fair value the financial reporting basis of the interests we already owned at the time of acquisition. The tax basis of the underlying properties of AllDale I & II did not include the Acquisition Gain.

The effective income tax rates for our income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 are less than the federal statutory rate, primarily due to the portion of income not subject to income taxes. The effective income tax rate for our income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 is less than the federal statutory rate, primarily due to the portion of income not subject to income taxes, partially offset by the effect of the Tax Election previously discussed.

​
Deferred tax liabilities for property, plant and equipment are primarily the result of the Alliance Minerals’ Tax Election and associated impact of the Acquisition Gain discussed above. Deferred tax liabilities for digital assets are due to the remeasurement of our digital assets to fair value, which is not taxable until the digital asset is sold. 
​
Federal and state loss carryovers and credits are primarily due to net operating losses and research and development credits associated with the operations of other subsidiaries that are taxable for federal income tax purposes. Research and development expenses are required to be capitalized and amortized for U.S. tax purposes, resulting in a deferred tax asset. These expenses are primarily associated with the operations of other subsidiaries that are taxable for federal income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets for federal loss carryovers and credits generally do not have an expiration date. Deferred tax assets for state loss carryovers and credits generally expire between 2027 and 2044 with some carryovers having indefinite carryforward periods.
​
Our 2020 through 2023 tax years remain open to examination by tax authorities, and lower-tier partnership income tax returns for the tax years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021 are being audited by the Internal Revenue Service. 
​

EARNINGS PER LIMITED PARTNER UNIT
​
We utilize the two-class method in calculating basic and diluted earnings per limited partner unit (“EPU”). Subsequent to the JC Resources Acquisition, net income attributable to ARLP is allocated to limited partners and participating securities with nonforfeitable distributions or distribution equivalents, while net losses attributable to ARLP are allocated only to limited partners but not to participating securities. Prior to the JC Resources Acquisition, in addition to limited partners and participating securities allocations, amounts were also allocated to our general partner for historical earnings from the mineral interests acquired in the JC Resources Acquisition. Our participating securities are outstanding restricted unit awards under our LTIP and phantom units in notional accounts under our SERP and the Directors’ Deferred Compensation Plan. The SERP and Directors’ Deferred Compensation Plan was terminated in December 2024 and will subsequently no longer receive an allocation of income.

SEGMENT INFORMATION
​
We operate in the United States as a diversified natural resource company that generates operating and royalty income from the production and marketing of coal to major domestic and international utilities and industrial users as well as royalty income from oil & gas mineral interests. We aggregate multiple operating segments into 
four
 reportable segments, Illinois Basin Coal Operations, Appalachia Coal Operations, Oil & Gas Royalties and Coal Royalties. We also have an “all other” category referred to as Other, Corporate and Elimination. Our 
two
 coal operations reportable segments correspond to major coal producing regions in the eastern United States with similar economic characteristics including coal quality, geology, coal marketing opportunities, mining and transportation methods and regulatory issues. The 
two
 coal operations reportable segments include 
seven
 mining complexes operating in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia and a coal loading terminal in Indiana on the Ohio River. Our Oil & Gas Royalties reportable segment includes our oil & gas mineral interests which are located primarily in the Permian (Delaware and Midland), Anadarko (SCOOP/STACK) and Williston (Bakken) basins. The operations within our Oil & Gas Royalties 
142

Table of Contents
reportable segment primarily include receiving royalties and lease bonuses for our oil & gas mineral interests. Our Coal Royalties reportable segment includes coal mineral reserves and resources owned or leased by Alliance Resource Properties, which are either (a) leased to our mining complexes or (b) near our coal mining operations but not yet leased. 
​
The Illinois Basin Coal Operations reportable segment includes (a) the Gibson County Coal, LLC’s mining complex, (b) the Warrior Coal, LLC mining complex, (c) the River View mining complex and (d) the Hamilton mining complex. The segment also includes our Mt. Vernon Transfer Terminal, LLC coal loading terminal in Indiana which operates on the Ohio River, Mid-America Carbonates, LLC and other support services, and our non-operating mining complexes. 
​
The Appalachia Coal Operations reportable segment includes (a) the Mettiki mining complex, (b) the Tunnel Ridge mining complex and (c) the MC Mining mining complex. 
​
The Oil & Gas Royalties reportable segment includes oil & gas mineral interests held by Alliance Minerals’ through its consolidated subsidiaries as well as equity interests held in AllDale III (Note 3 – Variable Interest Entities). 
​
Coal Royalties reportable segment includes coal mineral reserves and resources owned or leased by Alliance Resource Properties that are (a) leased to certain of our mining complexes in both the Illinois Basin Coal Operations and Appalachia Coal Operations reportable segments or (b) located near our operations and external mining operations. Approximately 
63
% of the coal sold by our coal operations’ mines is leased from our Coal Royalties entities. 
​
Other, Corporate and Elimination includes marketing and administrative activities, the Matrix Group, Bitiki, which holds our crypto-mining activities (see Note 7 – Digital Assets), our investments in Francis, Infinitum, NGP ET IV and Ascend (see Note 3 – Variable Interest Entities and Note 10 – Equity Investments), Wildcat Insurance, which assists the ARLP Partnership with its insurance requirements, and AROP Funding and Alliance Finance (both discussed in Note 12 – Long-Term Debt). The eliminations included in Other, Corporate and Elimination primarily represent the intercompany coal royalty transactions described above between our Coal Royalties reportable segment and our coal operations’ mines.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense includes operating expenses, coal purchases, if applicable, and other income or expense as adjusted to remove certain items from operating expenses that we characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations such as certain litigation accruals. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense is used as a financial measure by our management to assess the operating performance of our segments. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense is a key component of Segment Adjusted EBITDA in addition to coal sales, royalty revenues and other revenues. The exclusion of corporate general and administrative expenses from Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense allows management to focus solely on the evaluation of segment operating performance as it primarily relates to our operating expenses. 
​
(3)
Other segment items for each reportable segment includes:
Appalachia Coal Operations
 – a settlement gain at our Tunnel Ridge mine during 2022
Oil & Gas Royalties
 – equity method investment income from AllDale III and income allocated to noncontrolling interest
​
(4)
Segment Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to ARLP before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization and general and administrative expenses modified for certain items that we characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations, such as the change in fair value of digital assets and certain litigation accruals. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is used as a financial measure by Mr. Craft, the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of MGP, who is also our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), other management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others. Our CODM uses Segment Adjusted EBITDA in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. Segment Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to our CODM and investors regarding our performance and results of operations because Segment Adjusted EBITDA (i) provides additional information about our core operating performance and ability to generate and distribute cash flow, (ii) provides investors with the financial analytical framework upon which we base financial, operational, compensation and planning decisions, (iii) presents a measurement that investors, rating agencies and debt holders have indicated is useful in assessing us and our results of operations and (iv) allows our CODM and management to focus solely on the evaluation of segment operating profitability as it relates to our revenues and operating expenses, which are primarily controlled by our segments.

SUBSEQUENT EVENT
​
In February 2025, we committed to invest up to $
25.0
 million in a limited partnership sponsored by a private equity firm, which partnership vehicle intends to own, indirectly, an interest in a joint venture holding company formed with a third party that plans to indirectly acquire, own and operate a coal-fired electric generating plant. As of February 27, 2025, we have not funded any portion of our capital commitment.

Natural gas reserves are converted to BOE based on a 6:1 ratio: six Mcf of natural gas converts to one BOE.
​
Notable changes in proved reserves during the year ended December 31, 2022, included:
​
●
Net change due to extensions and discoveries -
 The increases are a result of additional development by the operators of the properties under which we own mineral interests. In 2022, a net addition of 4,598 MBOE occurred primarily from the completion of 1,212 new wells on our acreage and from the addition of 878 new proved undeveloped locations due to permitting and drilling activity.
​
●
Revisions -
 Increases in oil & gas are also due to changes in the underlying commodity prices during the year and revisions of previous quantity estimates.
​
Notable changes in proved reserves during the year ended December 31, 2023, included:

​
Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows 
​
Future cash inflows represent expected revenues from production of period-end quantities of proved reserves based on the 12-month unweighted average of first-of-the-month commodity prices for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. All prices are adjusted for quality, transportation fees, energy content and regional basis differentials. Future cash inflows are computed by applying applicable prices relating to our proved reserves to the year-end quantities of those reserves. Future production costs are derived based on current costs assuming continuation of existing economic conditions. 
​
While due care was taken in preparation of the following cash flow projections, we do not represent that this data is the fair value of our oil & gas properties, or a fair estimate of the present value of cash flows to be obtained from their development and production. Material revisions to estimates of proved reserves may occur in the future; development and production of the reserves may not occur in the periods assumed; actual prices are expected to vary significantly from those used and actual costs may vary.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL INFORMATION (PARENT)
​
1.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
​
In these parent-company-only financial statements, our investment in consolidated subsidiaries is stated at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings of subsidiaries and reduced by distributions received from subsidiaries since the date of acquisition. These parent-company-only financial statements should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
​
2.
GUARANTEES
​
As the parent of Alliance Coal and the Intermediate Partnership, ARLP is a guarantor of the Credit Facility and the 2029 Senior Notes discussed in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 12 – Long-Term Debt” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to these guarantees, ARLP has provided guarantees on surety indemnity agreements and financially guaranteed certain coal supply agreements. The duration of these guarantees varies. The maximum undiscounted potential future payment obligation for our guarantees of certain coal supply agreements as of December 31, 2024 is approximately $
21.9
 million. These guarantees provide for compensation to customers based on additional cost to the customer to replace any contracted tons that our subsidiaries fail to deliver. We do not expect to make any payments under these guarantees. 
​
3.
CASH DISTRIBUTIONS RECEIVED
​
We received distributions of $
363.4
 million, $
364.6
 million and $
196.3
 million from our consolidated subsidiaries during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

ITEM 9.
CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANT ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
​
None.
​
ITEM 9A.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
​
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
. We maintain controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosures. As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the CEO and CFO, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2024. Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that these controls and procedures are effective as of December 31, 2024.
​
Our management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the ARLP Partnership have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that simple errors or mistakes can occur. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based, in part, upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. We monitor our disclosure controls and internal controls and make modifications as necessary; our intent in this regard is that the disclosure controls and the internal controls will be maintained as systems change and conditions warrant.
​
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
. Management of the ARLP Partnership is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The ARLP Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors of our general partner regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Our controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the ARLP Partnership’s assets are protected from unauthorized use and that transactions are executed in accordance with established authorizations and properly recorded. The internal controls are supported by written policies and are complemented by a staff of competent business process owners and an internal auditor supported by competent and qualified external resources used to assist in testing the operating effectiveness of the ARLP Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting. Management concluded that the design and operations of our internal controls over financial reporting at December 31, 2024 are effective and provide reasonable assurance the books and records accurately reflect the transactions of the ARLP Partnership.
​
Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
​
Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by COSO in 
Internal Control
—
Integrated Framework (2013)
. Based on its assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, the ARLP Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria, and management believes that we have no material internal control weaknesses in our financial reporting process.

​
Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting
. There have not been any changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or Rule 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) in the three months ended December 31, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
​
Board of Directors of Alliance Resource Management GP, LLC
and Unitholders of Alliance Resource Partners, L.P.
​
Opinion on internal control over financial reporting 
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Alliance Resource Partners, L.P. (a Delaware limited partnership) and subsidiaries (the “Partnership”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, the Partnership maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by COSO.
​
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements of the Partnership as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, and our report dated February 27, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
​
Basis for opinion
The Partnership’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Partnership in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
​
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
​
Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
​
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

​
Board of Directors
​
Mr. Craft, who has been President and CEO and a member of the Board of Directors since ARLP’s inception, assumed the Chairman role effective January 1, 2019. We believe this leadership structure of the Board of Directors is appropriate for the Partnership given Mr. Craft’s extensive knowledge of our industries, significant ownership position, and proven leadership of the Partnership. 
​
In 2024, Mr. Vining was elected to the Board of Directors and serves in the capacity as Lead Director. In such capacity, Mr. Vining assists the Board of Directors and management on planning and other initiatives as directed from time to time by the Board of Directors or Mr. Craft.
​
The Board of Directors generally administers its risk oversight function through the board as a whole. The Chairman, President and CEO, who reports to the Board of Directors, and the other executives named above, who report to the Chairman, President and CEO or, in the case of Mrs. Cordle, the CFO, have day-to-day risk management responsibilities. At the Board of Directors’ request, each of these executives attends the meetings of the Board of Directors, where the Board of Directors routinely receives reports on our financial results, the status of our operations and our safety performance, and other aspects of the implementation of our business strategy, with ample opportunity for specific inquiries of management. In addition, management provides periodic reports of the Partnership’s financial and operational performance to each member of the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee provides additional risk oversight through its quarterly meetings, where it receives a report from the Partnership’s internal auditor, who reports directly to the Audit Committee, and reviews the Partnership’s contingencies, significant transactions and subsequent events, among other matters, with management and our independent auditors.

​
The Board of Directors has selected as director nominees individuals with experience, skills and qualifications relevant to the business of the Partnership, such as experience in energy or related industries or with financial markets or in regulatory affairs, expertise in mining, engineering or finance, and a history of service in senior leadership positions. The Board of Directors has not established a formal process for identifying director nominees but has endeavored to assemble a talented group of individuals with the qualities and attributes required to provide effective oversight of the Partnership.
​
Audit Committee
​
The Audit Committee comprises four of five non-employee members of the Board of Directors (Messrs. Carter, Druten and Torrence and Ms. McDaniel). After reviewing the qualifications of the current members of the Audit Committee, and any relationships they may have with us that might affect their independence, the Board of Directors has determined that all current Audit Committee members are “independent” as that concept is defined in Section 10A of the Exchange Act, all current Audit Committee members are “independent” as that concept is defined in the applicable rules of NASDAQ Stock Market, LLC, all current Audit Committee members are financially literate, and Mr. Torrence qualifies as an “audit committee financial expert” under the applicable rules promulgated pursuant to the Exchange Act.
​
Report of the Audit Committee
​
The Audit Committee oversees our financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors. Management has primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process including the systems of internal controls. The Audit Committee has responsibility for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of our independent registered public accounting firm and assists the Board of Directors by conducting its own review of our:
​
●
filings with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act and the Exchange Act (
e.g.
, Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K);
​
●
press releases and other communications by us to the public concerning earnings, financial condition and results of operations, including changes in distribution policies or practices affecting the holders of our units, if such review is not undertaken by the Board of Directors;
​
●
systems of internal controls regarding finance and accounting that management and the Board of Directors have established; and
​
●
auditing, accounting and financial reporting processes generally.
​
In fulfilling its oversight and other responsibilities, the Audit Committee met nine times during 2024. The Audit Committee’s activities included, but were not limited to: (a) selecting the independent registered public accounting firm, (b) meeting periodically in executive session with the independent registered public accounting firm, (c) reviewing the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, June 30, and September 30, 2024, (d) performing a self-assessment of the committee, (e) reviewing the Audit Committee charter, and (f) reviewing the overall scope, plans and findings of our internal auditor. Based on the results of the annual self-assessment, the Audit Committee believes that it satisfied the requirements of its charter. A copy of the Audit Committee charter is publicly available on our website under “Investor Relations” at 
www.arlp.com
 and is available in print without charge to any unitholder who requests it. Such requests should be directed to Investor Relations at (918) 295-7673. The Audit Committee also reviewed and discussed with management and the independent registered public accounting firm this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the audited financial statements.
​
Our independent registered public accounting firm, Grant Thornton, is responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of the audited financial statements with GAAP. The Audit Committee reviewed with Grant Thornton its judgment as to the quality, not just the acceptability, of our accounting principles and such other matters as are required to be discussed with the Audit Committee pursuant to the applicable requirements of the PCAOB and the SEC.
​
The Audit Committee received written disclosures and the letter from Grant Thornton required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB Rule 3526, “Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence,” and has discussed with Grant Thornton its independence from management and the ARLP Partnership.

​
Code of Ethics
​
We have adopted a code of ethics with which the Chairman, President and CEO and the senior financial officers (including the principal financial officer and the principal accounting officer) are expected to comply. The code of ethics is publicly available on our website under “Investor Relations” at 
www.arlp.com
 and is available in print without charge to any unitholder who requests it. Such requests should be directed to Investor Relations at (918) 295-7673. If any substantive amendments are made to the code of ethics or if there is a grant of a waiver, including any implicit waiver, from a provision of the code to the President and CEO, Chief Financial Officer, or Chief Accounting Officer, we will disclose the nature of such amendment or waiver on our website or in a report on Form 8-K. There were no such amendments or waivers during the year ended December 31, 2024.
​
Insider Trading Policy
​
We have an 
insider trading policy
 governing transactions in ARLP’s securities and derivative securities relating to ARLP’s units that applies to any employee, officer, or director of the Partnership as well as to the Partnership. We believe that our insider trading policy is reasonably designed to promote compliance with insider trading laws, rules and regulations, and listing standards applicable to the Partnership. A copy of the Partnership’s insider trading policy is filed as Exhibit 19.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
​
Communications with the Board
​
Unitholders or other interested parties can contact any director or committee of the Board of Directors by writing to them c/o Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, P.O. Box 22027, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74121-2027. Comments or complaints relating to our accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters will also be referred to members of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee has procedures for (a) receipt, retention and treatment of complaints received by us regarding accounting, internal accounting controls, or auditing matters and (b) the confidential, anonymous submission by our employees of concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters.
​
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
​
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, as amended, requires directors, executive officers and persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of a registered class of our equity securities to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports or changes in ownership of such equity securities. Based on a review of the copies of the forms furnished to us and written representations from certain reporting persons, we believe that during 2024 none of our directors or executive officers or persons who beneficially owned more than ten percent of a registered class of our equity securities were delinquent with respect to any of the filing requirements under Section 16(a), with the following exception: D. Andrew Woodward, former Senior Vice President - New Ventures, filed a Form 4 on February 12, 2024 that included a transaction occurring on January 24, 2024.

​
Reimbursement of Expenses of our General Partner and its Affiliates

ITEM 11.
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
​
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
​
Introduction
​
The Compensation Committee oversees the compensation of our general partner’s executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers, each of whom is named in the Summary Compensation Table. Our Named Executive Officers are employees of our operating subsidiary, Alliance Coal. 
​
Compensation Objectives and Philosophy
​
The compensation of our Named Executive Officers is designed to achieve three key objectives: (i) provide a competitive compensation opportunity to allow us to recruit and retain key management talent, (ii) align executive officers’ interests with unitholder interests and (iii) motivate and reward the executive officers for creating sustainable, capital-efficient growth in available cash to maximize unitholder returns. In making decisions regarding executive compensation, the Compensation Committee reviews current compensation levels of peer company executives in similar roles as the Named Executive Officers, considers the Chairman, President and CEO’s assessment of each of the other executives, and uses its discretion to determine an appropriate total compensation package of base salary and short-term and long-term incentives. The Compensation Committee intends for each executive officer’s total compensation to be competitive in the marketplace and to effectively motivate the officer. Based on its review of our overall executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee believes the program is appropriately applied to our general partner’s executive officers and is necessary to attract and retain the executive officers who are essential to our continued development and success, to compensate those executive officers for their contributions and to enhance unitholder value. Moreover, the Compensation Committee believes the total compensation opportunities provided to our general partner’s executive officers create alignment with our long-term interests and those of our unitholders. As a result, we do not maintain unit ownership requirements for our Named Executive Officers.
​
Setting Executive Compensation
​
Role of the Compensation Committee
​
The Compensation Committee discharges the Board of Directors’ responsibilities relating to our general partner’s executive compensation program. The Compensation Committee oversees our compensation and benefit plans and policies, administers our incentive bonus and equity participation plans, and reviews and approves annually all compensation decisions relating to our Named Executive Officers. The Compensation Committee is empowered by the Board of Directors and by the Compensation Committee’s charter to make all decisions regarding compensation for our Named Executive Officers without ratification or other action by the Board of Directors. The Compensation Committee has the authority to secure services for executive compensation matters, legal advice, or other expert services, both from within and outside the company. While the Compensation Committee is empowered to delegate all or a portion of its duties to a subcommittee, it has not done so.
​
The Compensation Committee comprises all of our directors who have been determined to be “independent” by the Board of Directors in accordance with applicable NASDAQ Stock Market, LLC and SEC regulations, presently Messrs. Carter, Druten and Torrence and Ms. McDaniel.
​
Role of Executive Officers
​
Each year, the Chairman, President and CEO submits recommendations to the Compensation Committee for adjustments to the salary, bonuses and long-term equity incentive awards payable to our Named Executive Officers, excluding himself. The Chairman, President and CEO bases his recommendations on his assessment of each executive’s performance, experience, demonstrated leadership, job knowledge and management skills. The Compensation Committee considers the recommendations of the Chairman, President and CEO as one factor in making compensation decisions regarding our Named Executive Officers. Historically, and in 2024, the Compensation Committee and the Chairman, President and CEO have been substantially aligned on decisions regarding the compensation of the Named Executive Officers. As executive officers are promoted or hired during the year, the Chairman, President and CEO makes 
164

Table of Contents
compensation recommendations to the Compensation Committee and works closely with the Compensation Committee to ensure that all compensation arrangements for executive officers are consistent with our compensation philosophy and are approved by the Compensation Committee. At the direction of the Compensation Committee, the Chairman, President and CEO and the Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary attend certain meetings of the Compensation Committee.
​
Use of Peer Group Comparisons
​
The Compensation Committee believes that it is important to review and compare our performance with that of peer companies and reviews the composition of the peer group annually. The peer group represents organizations of such size and complexity of operations in the coal industry and the oil & gas minerals industry as deemed relevant to the Compensation Committee. For 2024, the peer group consisted of the following companies: Alpha Metallurgical Resources, Inc., Black Stone Minerals, L.P., Arch Resources, Inc., Consol Energy, Inc., Dorchester Minerals, L.P., Kimbell Royalty Partners, LP, Natural Resource Partners L.P., Peabody Energy Corporation, Sitio Royalties Corp., and Warrior Met Coal, Inc. In assessing the competitiveness of our executive compensation program for 2024, the Compensation Committee, with the assistance of the Chairman, President and CEO, collected and analyzed publicly available data from the peer group, including proxy information, annual reports, and other disclosures, and developed a comparative analysis of base salaries, short-term incentives, total cash compensation, long-term incentives, and total compensation to align with the role performed by each of our Named Executive Officers. The Compensation Committee uses the peer group data as a point of reference for comparative purposes, but it is not the determinative factor for the compensation of our Named Executive Officers. The Compensation Committee exercises discretion in determining the nature and extent of the use of comparative pay data.
​
Consideration of Equity Ownership and CEO Compensation
​
Mr. Craft, the Chairman, President and CEO, is evaluated and treated differently with respect to compensation than our other Named Executive Officers. Mr. Craft and related entities own significant equity positions in ARLP and Mr. Craft indirectly owns our general partner. Because of these ownership positions, the interests of Mr. Craft are directly aligned with those of our unitholders. Mr. Craft has not received an increase in base salary since 2002, has not received a bonus under our STIP since 2005 and did not receive any grants of LTIP awards from 2005 through 2015. On January 22, 2016, the Compensation Committee approved an LTIP award for Mr. Craft that vested on January 1, 2019. Mr. Craft has not received any subsequent LTIP awards. Beginning in February 2016, at Mr. Craft’s request, his annual base salary was reduced to $1.
​
Employment Agreements
​
We have not historically maintained employment agreements with any of our Named Executive Officers. However, we provided an employment letter to our Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, Mr. Schnitzer, in connection with his hiring in March 2024 setting forth the terms of his employment, which we determined was necessary to successfully hire Mr. Schnitzer and in the best interests of the Partnership. The Schnitzer Employment Letter provides for, among other things, (i) an initial annual base salary of $400,000, (ii) participation in our short-term incentive plan at 75% of annual base salary, (iii) an initial award in 2024 under the LTIP having value on the grant date of $640,000, and (iv) a signing bonus of $1.408 million, payable over eight quarters of $184,000 for each of the first four quarters and $168,000 for each of the last four quarters, in each case subject to Mr. Schnitzer’s continued employment through the applicable payment dates. The Schnitzer Employment Letter also provides for the payment of severance if Mr. Schnitzer’s employment is terminated on or before March 1, 2027 (as more fully described below).  The foregoing description of the Schnitzer Employment Letter does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full and complete text of the Schnitzer Employment Letter, which is filed as Exhibit 10.28 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a more complete description of the Schnitzer Employment Letter with respect to severance payments, see “Item 11. Executive Compensation—
Potential Payments Upon a Termination or Change in Control
.”
​
Compensation Components
​
Overview
​
The principal components of compensation for our Named Executive Officers (other than Mr. Craft) include:
​
●
base salary;
165

Table of Contents
​
●
annual cash incentive bonus awards under the STIP; and
​
●
awards of restricted units under the LTIP, including DERs.
​
The relative amount of each component is not based on any formula, but rather is based on the recommendation of the Chairman, President and CEO, subject to the discretion of the Compensation Committee to make any modifications it deems appropriate.
​
All executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers, are entitled to customary benefits available to our employees generally, including group medical, dental, and life insurance and participation in our PSSP. Our PSSP is a defined contribution plan and includes an employer matching contribution of 75% on the first 3% of eligible compensation contributed by the employee, an employer non-matching contribution of 0.75% of eligible compensation, and an employer supplemental contribution of 5% of eligible compensation. The PSSP provides an additional means of attracting and retaining qualified employees by providing tax-advantaged opportunities for employees to save for retirement. We previously maintained a SERP for each of our Named Executive Officers, but in December 2023, our Board took action to terminate that SERP, which became effective in 2024.  Each of our Named Executive Officers (including Mr. Craft but excluding Mr. Schnitzer, who became employed after the Board of Directors determined to terminate the SERP) also received supplemental retirement benefits through the SERP in 2024, which are described in more detail below. 
​
Base Salary
​
When reviewing base salaries, the Compensation Committee’s policy is to consider the individual’s experience, tenure and performance, the individual’s level of responsibility, the position’s complexity and its importance to us in relation to other executive positions, our financial performance, and competitive pay practices. The Compensation Committee also considers comparative compensation data of companies in our peer group and the recommendation of the Chairman, President and CEO of our general partner. Base salaries are reviewed annually to ensure continuing consistency with market levels, and adjustments to base salaries are made as needed to reflect movement in the competitive market as well as individual performance. None of our Named Executive Officers received an increase in salary during the 2024 year.
​
Annual Cash Incentive Bonus Awards 
​
The STIP is designed to assist us in attracting, retaining and motivating qualified personnel by rewarding management, including our Named Executive Officers, and selected other salaried employees with cash awards for our achievement of an annual financial performance target. The annual performance target is recommended by the Chairman, President and CEO and approved by the Compensation Committee, typically in January of each year. The performance measure is subject to equitable adjustment in the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee to reflect the occurrence of any significant events during the year.
​
The performance target historically has been EBITDA-based, with items added or removed from the EBITDA calculation to ensure that the performance target reflects the operating results of our core businesses. (EBITDA is defined as net income of ARLP before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization and net income attributable to noncontrolling interest.) The aggregate cash available for awards under the STIP each year is dependent on our actual financial results for the year compared to the annual performance target, and it increases in relation to our EBITDA, as adjusted, exceeding the minimum threshold. Our STIP Guidelines provide that achieving the minimum threshold is the minimum acceptable result for a performance pay-out to occur under the STIP, although the Compensation Committee may determine satisfactory results and adjust the size of the pay-out pool in its sole discretion. In 2024, the Compensation Committee approved a minimum financial performance target of $745.7 million in EBITDA from current operations, normalized by excluding any charges for unit-based and directors’ compensation as well as other equitable adjustments determined to be appropriate by the Compensation Committee. For 2024, we met the minimum performance target. 
​
Individual awards to our Named Executive Officers each year are determined by the Compensation Committee. However, the Compensation Committee does not establish individual target payout amounts for the Named Executive Officers’ STIP awards. As it does when reviewing base salaries, in determining individual awards under the STIP, the Compensation Committee considers its assessment of the individual’s performance, our financial performance, comparative compensation data of companies in our peer group and the recommendation of the Chairman, President and 
166

Table of Contents
CEO, although EBITDA-based performance targets described above are given significant weight. The compensation expense associated with STIP awards is recognized in the year earned, with the cash awards generally payable in the first quarter of the following calendar year. Termination of employment of an executive officer for any reason prior to payment of a cash award will result in forfeiture of any right to the award, unless and to the extent waived by the Compensation Committee in its discretion.
​
The performance measure for the STIP in 2025 will be based on adjusted EBITDA for current operations, excluding charges for unit-based and directors’ compensation. As discussed above, the Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, make equitable adjustments to the performance criteria under the STIP and adjust the amount of the aggregate pay-out. The Compensation Committee believes the STIP performance criteria for 2025 will be reasonably difficult to achieve and therefore support our key compensation objectives discussed above.
​
The Compensation Committee maintains discretion to grant cash bonus awards outside of the STIP to address special situations. 
​
Equity Awards under the LTIP
​
Equity compensation pursuant to the LTIP is a key component of our executive compensation program. Our LTIP is sponsored by Alliance Coal. Under the LTIP, grants may be made of either (a) restricted units, (b) options to purchase common units (although to date, no grants of options have been made) or (c) cash awards. The Compensation Committee has the authority to determine the participants to whom restricted units are granted, the number of restricted units to be granted to each such participant, and the conditions under which the restricted units may become vested, including the duration of any vesting period. Annual grant levels for designated participants (including our Named Executive Officers) are recommended by our general partner’s Chairman, President and CEO, subject to review and approval by the Compensation Committee. Grant levels are intended to support the objectives of the comprehensive compensation package described above. The LTIP grants provide our Named Executive Officers with the opportunity to achieve a meaningful ownership stake in the Partnership, thereby assuring that their interests are aligned with our success. Even though Mr. Craft has not been granted an award under the LTIP since 2005, with the exception of one grant in 2016, the Compensation Committee believes Mr. Craft’s interests are directly aligned with the interests of our unitholders as a result of his ownership positions. There is no formula for determining the size of awards to any individual recipient and, as it does when reviewing base salaries and individual STIP payments, the Compensation Committee considers its assessment of the individual’s performance, our financial performance, compensation levels at peer companies in the coal industry and the recommendation of the Chairman, President and CEO. Amounts realized from prior grants, including amounts realized due to changes in the value of our common units, are not considered in setting grant levels or other compensation for our Named Executive Officers.
​
Restricted Units.
 Restricted units granted under the LTIP are “phantom” or notional units that upon vesting entitle the participant to receive an ARLP common unit. Restricted units granted under the LTIP vest at the end of a stated period from the grant date, provided we achieve an aggregate performance target for that period. However, if a grantee’s employment is terminated for any reason prior to the vesting of any restricted units, those restricted units will generally be forfeited, (i) unless the Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, determines otherwise or (ii) except as provided otherwise in the LTIP or under any written compensatory agreement. The number of units distributed upon satisfaction of the applicable vesting requirements is reduced to cover the income tax withholding requirement for each individual participant based on the fair market value of the common units as of the date of distribution. At the Compensation Committee’s discretion, grants of restricted units under the LTIP may include the contingent right to receive quarterly distributions in an amount equal to the cash distributions we make to unitholders during the vesting period. DERs are payable, in the discretion of the Compensation Committee, either in cash or in the form of additional Restricted Units credited to a book-keeping account subject to the same vesting restrictions as the tandem award.
​
The performance target applicable to restricted unit awards under the LTIP is based on a normalized EBITDA measure and requires achieving an aggregate performance level for the vesting period. We typically issue grants under the LTIP at the beginning of each year, with the exceptions of new employees who begin employment with us at some other time and job promotions that may occur at some other time. The compensation expense associated with LTIP grants is recognized over the vesting period in accordance with FASB ASC 718, 
Compensation — Stock Compensation
.
​
Our general partner’s policy is to grant restricted units pursuant to the LTIP to serve as a means of incentive compensation for performance. Therefore, no consideration will be payable by the LTIP participants upon receipt of the common units. Common units to be delivered upon the vesting of restricted units may be common units we already own, 
167

Table of Contents
common units we acquire in the open market or from any other person, newly issued common units, or any combination of the foregoing. If we issue new common units upon payment of the restricted units instead of purchasing them, the total number of common units outstanding will increase.
​
The LTIP provides the Compensation Committee with the discretion to determine the conditions for vesting (as well as all other terms and conditions) associated with any award under the plan, and to amend any of those conditions so long as an amendment does not materially reduce the benefit to the participant. The Compensation Committee believes the performance-related vesting conditions of all outstanding awards under the LTIP will be reasonably difficult to satisfy and therefore support our key compensation objectives discussed above.   
​
Grants for 2024 under the LTIP, authorized on January 24, 2024, will cliff vest on January 1, 2027, provided we achieve a target level of aggregate EBITDA for current operations, excluding any charges for unit-based and directors’ compensation, for the period January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2026. Regardless of achieving the EBITDA target, the 2024 grants have a minimum value guarantee of either $15.95 or $10.63 per unit (as the case may apply to a grant recipient based on such recipient’s seniority level). Grants for 2025 under the LTIP, authorized on January 28, 2025, will cliff vest on January 1, 2028, provided we achieve a target level of aggregate EBITDA for current operations, excluding any charges for unit-based and directors’ compensation, for the period January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2027. Regardless of achieving the EBITDA target, the 2025 grants have a minimum value guarantee of either $19.99 or $13.33 per unit (as the case may apply to a grant recipient based on such recipient’s seniority level). 
​
Unit Options
. We have not made any grants of unit options. The Compensation Committee, in the future, may decide to make unit option grants to employees and directors on terms determined by the Compensation Committee.
​
Policies and Practices Related to the Grant of Certain Equity Awards in Relation to the Release of Material Non-Public Information
. Although we do not currently have a formal practice or policy regarding equity award grant timing, the Compensation Committee does not time, nor has the Compensation Committee in the past timed, the grant of LTIP awards in coordination with the release of material non-public information. Instead, LTIP awards are granted only at the time or times dictated by our normal compensation process as developed by the Compensation Committee.
​
Effect of a Change in Control
. Upon a “change in control” as defined in the LTIP (and described below), all awards outstanding under the LTIP will automatically vest and become payable or exercisable, as the case may be, in full. Please see “Item 11. Executive Compensation—
Potential Payments Upon a Termination or Change in Control
” for additional information regarding the treatment of equity upon a change in control.
​
Amendments and Termination
. The Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, terminate the LTIP at any time with respect to any common units for which a grant has not previously been made. Except as required by the rules of the exchange on which the common units may be listed at that time, the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee may alter or amend the LTIP in any manner from time to time; provided, however, that no change in any outstanding grant may be made that would materially impair the rights of the participant without the consent of the affected participant. In addition, the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, establish such additional compensation and incentive arrangements as it deems appropriate to motivate and reward our employees.
​
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
​
The SERP was sponsored by Alliance Coal. Participation in the SERP aligned the interest of each participant with the interests of our unitholders because all allocations made to participants under the SERP were made in the form of notional common units of ARLP, defined in the SERP as “phantom units.” The Compensation Committee approved the SERP participants and their percentage allocations, and could amend or terminate the SERP at any time. All of our Named Executive Officers (other than Mr. Schnitzer) participated in the SERP.
​
On December 14, 2023, the Compensation Committee approved termination of the SERP and authorized distribution of accounts to participants on December 15, 2024 or as soon thereafter as practical. Account settlements were required to be delayed at least one year according to termination rules governing the SERP. The accounts continued to accrue benefits in accordance with plan terms until distributed. In December 2024, the Compensation Committee approved the distribution of the value of the SERP accounts to plan participants in cash rather than ARLP common units, and on December 16, 2024, final distributions of applicable plan accounts were settled in cash. As of December 31, 2024, we had no obligations associated with the SERP.
168

Table of Contents
​
Under the terms of the SERP, a participant was entitled to receive on December 31 of each year an allocation of phantom units having a fair market value equal to his or her percentage allocation multiplied by the sum of the participant’s base salary and cash bonus received that year, then reduced by any supplemental contribution that was made to our defined contribution PSSP for the participant that year. A participant’s cumulative notional phantom unit account balance earned the equivalent of common unit distributions, which were added to the notional account balance in the form of additional phantom units. All amounts granted under the SERP vested immediately and would have been paid out upon the participant’s termination from employment in ARLP common units equal to the number of phantom units then credited to the participant’s account, less the number of units required to satisfy our tax withholding obligations. A participant in the SERP was not entitled to an allocation for the year in which his termination from employment occurred, except as described below.
​
A participant in the SERP was entitled to receive an allocation under the SERP for the year in which his employment was terminated only if such termination resulted from one of the following events:
​
(1)
the participant’s employment was terminated other than for “cause”;
​
(2)
the participant terminated employment for “good reason”;
​
(3)
a change of control of us or our general partner occurred and, as a result, the participant’s employment was terminated (whether voluntary or involuntary);
​
(4)
death of the participant;
​
(5)
the participant attained retirement age of 65 years; or
​
(6)
the participant incurred a total and permanent disability, which shall be deemed to occur if the participant was eligible to receive benefits under the terms of the long-term disability program we maintain.
​
This allocation for the year in which a participant’s termination occurred equaled the participant’s eligible compensation for the year (including any severance amount, if applicable) multiplied by his percentage allocation under the SERP, reduced by any supplemental contribution that was made to our defined contribution PSSP for the participant that year.
​
Other Compensation-Related Matters
​
Insider Trading Policy; Prohibitions on Hedging and Trading in Derivatives
​
To ensure alignment of the interests of our unitholders with our directors and all officers, including Named Executive Officers, the Partnership’s Insider Trading Policy prohibits any employee, officer, or director of the Partnership or any of its subsidiaries from engaging in trading involving (1) options or other derivative securities relating to ARLP units; (2) debt securities of ARLP or its affiliates; (3) hedging transactions involving ARLP securities; or (4) purchases of ARLP units on margin. Please read “Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance of the General Partner – 
Insider Trading Policy
” for a discussion of our Insider Trading Policy.
​
Tax Deductibility of Compensation
​
The deduction limitations imposed under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code do not apply to compensation paid to our Named Executive Officers because we are a limited partnership and not a “corporation” within the meaning of Section 162(m).
​
Perquisites and Personal Benefits
​
The Partnership provides a limited amount of perquisites and personal benefits to the Named Executive Officers in keeping with the Compensation Committee’s objectives to provide competitive compensation to motivate and reward executive officers for creating sustainable, capital-efficient growth in available cash. These perquisites and personal 
169

Table of Contents
benefits typically include amounts for items such as tax preparation fees and annual physical medical exams, and are reviewed annually by the Compensation Committee.
​
Clawback Policy
​
We maintain the Alliance Resource Partners, L.P. Incentive-Based Compensation Recoupment Policy (the “Clawback Policy”), which is administered by the Compensation Committee. The Clawback Policy authorizes the Compensation Committee to recoup incentive compensation from applicable officers, including each of the Named Executive Officers, in the event of a restatement of financial statements. A copy of the Clawback Policy is filed as Exhibit 97.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
​
Compensation Committee Report
​
The Compensation Committee has submitted the following report for inclusion in this Annual Report on Form 10-K:

In accordance with the provisions of the SERP, a participant’s cumulative notional phantom unit account balance earned the equivalent of common unit distributions when we paid a distribution to our common unitholders, which is added to the account balance in the form of phantom units. In December 2024, the SERP was terminated, and all plan account balances were settled in cash.

These contributions were made in accordance with the SERP plan document that had been approved by the Compensation Committee. Therefore, these contributions were not separately approved by the Compensation Committee.

Awards under the STIP are subject to our achieving an annual financial performance target each year. However, determination of individual awards under the STIP is based on an assessment of the Named Executive Officer’s performance, comparative compensation data of companies in our peer group and recommendation of the 
Chairman, President and CEO
. The STIP does not specify any threshold or maximum payout amounts. Please see “Item 11. Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Compensation Components—
Annual Cash Incentive Bonus Awards
” for additional information regarding the STIP awards.
​

These amounts represent awards pursuant to our STIP. On January 24, 2024, the Compensation Committee set the EBITDA target amount for use in determining the total plan payout for 2024. The discretionary payout allocations to all participating employees are determined after the year is completed. Please see “Item 11. Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Compensation Components—
Annual Cash Incentive Bonus Awards
” for additional information regarding the STIP awards.

Grants of restricted units under our LTIP are generally not subject to minimum thresholds, targets or maximum payout conditions. However, the vesting of these grants is subject to the satisfaction of certain performance criteria. The grants include a minimum value guarantee. Please see “Item 11. Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Compensation Components—
Equity Awards under the LTIP
.”

These awards are grants of restricted units pursuant to our LTIP. The grants include a minimum value guarantee. Please see “Item 11. Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Compensation Components—

These awards are phantom units added to each Named Executive Officer’s SERP notional account balance

(other than Mr. Schnitzer, who was not a participant in the SERP). On December 16, 2024, final distributions of applicable SERP plan accounts were settled in cash. Please see “Item 11. Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Compensation Components—
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
.” 
​

We calculated the fair value of LTIP awards granted on February 14, 2024 to our Named Executive Officers using a value of $19.75 per unit, the closing unit price on the grant date. We calculated the fair value of LTIP awards granted on March 1, 2024 to Mr. Schnitzer using a value of $18.81 per unit, the closing unit price on the grant date. We calculated the fair value of SERP phantom unit awards using the market closing price on the date the phantom unit award was granted. Phantom units granted under the SERP vested on the date granted.

Narrative Discussion Relating to the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table for 2024
​
For a discussion of the SERP, please see “Item 11. Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Compensation Components—
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
.”
​
Potential Payments Upon a Termination or Change in Control
​
The following disclosures discuss the payments and benefits that each of our Named Executive Officers would have been eligible to receive upon certain termination events, assuming that each such termination occurred on December 31, 2024. As a result, the payments and benefits disclosed represent what would have been due to such Named Executive Officers under the applicable agreements and plans in existence as of December 31, 2024; this disclosure does not reflect any changes to such agreements or plans, or new agreements or plans adopted, after December 31, 2024, unless specifically stated.
​
Treatment of LTIP Awards upon a Change in Control 
​
Each of our Named Executive Officers is eligible to receive, accelerated vesting and payment under the LTIP upon certain terminations of employment or upon our change in control. Upon a “change in control,” as defined in the LTIP, all outstanding awards under the LTIP will automatically vest and become payable or exercisable, as the case may be, in full. All restricted periods shall terminate and all performance criteria, if any, shall be deemed to have been achieved at the maximum level. 
​
Under the LTIP, a “change in control” generally means, and will be deemed to have occurred upon the occurrence of one or more of the following events: (i) any sale, lease, exchange or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Partnership to any Person (as defined in the LTIP) or its affiliates, unless following the applicable transaction such assets are controlled, directly or indirectly, by Mr. Craft; (ii) the consolidation or merger of the Partnership with or into another Person pursuant to a transaction in which the outstanding voting interests of the Partnership are changed into or 
176

Table of Contents
exchanged for cash, securities or other property, other than any such transaction where (a) the outstanding voting interests of the Partnership are changed into or exchanged for voting stock or interests of the surviving corporation or its parent, (b) the holders of the voting interests of the Partnership immediately prior to such transaction own, directly or indirectly, not less than a majority of the voting stock or interests of the surviving corporation or its parent immediately after such transaction, and (c) Mr. Craft, directly or indirectly, retains control over the business of the Partnership or any successor entity; or (iii) a “person” or “group” being or becoming the “beneficial owner” (such quoted terms as defined in the Exchange Act) of more than 50% of all voting interests of the Partnership then outstanding, other than (a) in a merger or consolidation which would not constitute a Change in Control under clause (ii) above or (b) any transaction in which Mr. Craft, directly or indirectly, retains control over the business of the Partnership or any successor entity.
​
Treatment of LTIP Awards upon a Termination of Employment (in connection with a Sale of Significant Assets
)
​
Pursuant to the terms of the LTIP, in the event the Partnership sells or otherwise disposes of a significant portion of the assets under its control (as determined by action of the Board in its sole discretion), and as a result of such disposition (i) a participant’s employment is terminated without “Cause” or by the participant for “Good Reason” or (ii) the participant’s employer will no longer be the Partnership or one of its affiliates, then all outstanding awards under the LTIP will automatically vest and become payable or exercisable, as the case may be, in full. All restricted periods shall terminate and all performance criteria, if any, shall be deemed to have been achieved at the maximum level; provided, however, that the restricted period may not terminate prior to the end of the “subordination period” (such quoted terms as defined in the LTIP). The subordination period has ended.
​
Termination of Employment under the Schnitzer Employment Letter
​
The Schnitzer Employment Letter provides that if Mr. Schnitzer’s employment is terminated on or before March 1, 2027 (x) by us for any reason including a “Change of Control” but other than for “Cause” or (y) by Mr. Schnitzer for “Good Reason” (such quoted terms as defined in the Schnitzer Employment Letter), Mr. Schnitzer will receive a severance payment in an amount equal to (a) two times Mr. Schnitzer’s then-effective annual base salary, plus (b) two times the then-effective standard payout for Mr. Schnitzer under the STIP, plus (c) any unpaid installment(s) of his signing bonus. 
​
Except for the severance provided to Mr. Schnitzer under the Schnitzer Employment Letter, none of our Named Executive Officers were eligible for severance or change in control benefits outside of the potential equity award acceleration under the LTIP, as described above. 
​

Table of Contents
Quantification of Payments
​
The table below discloses the amount of compensation and/or benefits due to our Named Executive Officers in the event of their termination of employment and/or upon a change in control under their compensatory arrangements in effect on December 31, 2024. The actual amounts to be paid are dependent on various factors, which may or may not exist at the time a Named Executive Officer is actually terminated and/or a change in control actually occurs. All accelerated equity award values are calculated using a unit price of $26.29 per unit, the closing price of our common units on December 31, 2024.

Director Compensation
​
The sole member of our general partner has the right to set the compensation of the directors of our general partner. Typically, such compensation has been set by the Compensation Committee with the concurrence of Mr. Craft, who indirectly owns our general partner. Mr. Craft, our only employee director, received no director compensation for 2024, and all compensation that Mr. Craft received in his capacity as an employee is set forth above within the Summary Compensation Table. The directors of MGP devote 100% of their time as directors of MGP to the business of the ARLP Partnership.

– Common Unit-Based Compensation Plans
”). Please see

On December 16, 2024, the Directors’ Deferred Compensation Plan was terminated, and all of the “phantom” ARLP common units settled in cash. At December 31, 2024, no director had a deferred balance under the Directors’ Deferred Compensation Plan.

Ms. McDaniel was appointed to the Board of Directors in December 2024.
​
(5)
Mr. Robinson retired as a director effective December 31, 2024.
​
Narrative to Director Compensation Table
​
Compensation for our non-employee directors includes an annual cash retainer paid quarterly in advance on a pro rata basis. The annual retainer for 2024 was $215,000. In addition to the retainer, Mr. Torrence was entitled to annual cash compensation in 2024 of $30,000 for service as Chairman of the Audit Committee. Mr. Robinson and Mr. Carter were entitled to additional annual cash compensation of $10,000 each for service as Chairman of the Compensation Committee, prorated to each based on Mr. Robinson’s service through June 2024 and Mr. Carter’s service commencing in July 2024. Mr. Druten was entitled to annual cash compensation in 2024 of $10,000 for service as Chairman of the Conflicts Committee, and Mr. Vining was entitled to additional annual compensation of $145,000 for his service as Lead Director of the Board of Directors which was prorated for 2024 based on his service on the Board of Directors commencing in July 2024. 
​
Prior to 2025, directors had the option to defer all or part of their cash compensation pursuant to the Directors’ Deferred Compensation Plan by completing an election form prior to the beginning of each calendar year. No director elected to defer cash compensation in 2024. On December 14, 2023 the Board of Directors approved the termination of the Directors’ Deferred Compensation Plan, and authorized the distribution of accounts on December 15, 2024 or as soon thereafter as practical. Termination rules regarding deferred compensation plans required the termination of this plan in connection with the termination of the SERP. In December 2024, the Board of Directors approved the distribution of the fair value of the phantom units credited to the accounts of the directors that were participants in the Deferred Compensation Account in cash rather than ARLP common units on or about December 16, 2024.
​
Pursuant to the Directors’ Deferred Compensation Plan, a notional account was established for deferred amounts of cash compensation and credited with notional common units of ARLP, described in the plan as “phantom” units. The number of phantom units credited was determined by dividing the amount deferred by the average closing unit price for the ten trading days immediately preceding the deferral date. When quarterly cash distributions were made with respect to ARLP common units, an amount equal to such quarterly distribution was credited to the notional account as additional phantom units. Payment of accounts under the Directors’ Deferred Compensation Plan was to be made in ARLP common

units equal to the number of phantom units then credited to the director’s account. As discussed above, payments to the directors of the fair value of the phantom units credited to their accounts in connection with the termination of such plan were made in cash in December 2024.
​
CEO Pay Ratio Disclosures
​
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of Joseph W. Craft III, our CEO. 
​
For 2024, our last completed fiscal year: 
​
●
The median of the annual total compensation of all employees of our company (other than the CEO) was $89,422.
●
The annual total compensation of our CEO, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table was $1.
●
Based on this information, for 2024 the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees was reasonably estimated to be 0.00001 to 1.
​
To determine the annual total compensation of our median employee and our CEO, we took the following steps: 
​
●
Using the same median employee identified in 2023, we combined all of the elements of such employee’s compensation for the 2024 year in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, resulting in annual total compensation of $89,422, comprised of such employee’s W-2 compensation of $83,622 and contributions in the amount of $5,800 that we made on the employee’s behalf to our 401(k) plan for the 2024 year. 
●
With respect to the annual total compensation of our CEO, we used the amount reported in the “Total” column of our 2024 Summary Compensation Table. 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
​
Mr. Craft, Chairman, President and CEO of our general partner, is also Chairman, President and CEO of AGP, which is the direct owner of 100% of the membership interests of our general partner. Otherwise, none of our executive officers serves as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any entity that has one or more of its executive officers serving as a member of the Board of Directors or Compensation Committee of our general partner.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR
 INDEPENDENCE
​
Omnibus Agreement
​
We are party to an omnibus agreement with MGP and AGP, which governs potential competition among us and the other parties to this agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the omnibus agreement, AGP and its affiliates agreed, for so long as Mr. Craft controls MGP, not to engage in the business of mining, marketing or transporting coal in the United States, unless it first offers us the opportunity to engage in a potential activity or acquire a potential business, and the Board of Directors, with the concurrence of its Conflicts Committee, elects to cause us not to pursue such opportunity or acquisition. In addition, AGP has the ability to purchase businesses, the majority value of which is not mining, marketing or transporting coal, provided AGP offers us the opportunity to purchase the coal assets following the acquisition. The restriction does not apply to the assets retained and business conducted by an affiliate of AGP at the closing of our initial public offering. Except as provided above, AGP and its affiliates are prohibited from engaging in activities wherein they compete directly with us.   
​
Other Related-Party 
Transactions
​
In addition to the related-party policies and transactions discussed in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Organization and Presentation and Note 21 — Related-Party Transactions” ARLP has the following additional related-party transactions:
​
Board of Directors
​
As discussed in “Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance of the General Partner”, Paul H. Vining was elected to the Board of Directors as lead director on July 24, 2024. Prior to his election to the Board of Directors, Mr. Vining provided consulting services to the Partnership. We paid $0.2 million through July 2024 for these consulting services.
​
Expense Reimbursements
​
Our partnership agreement provides that MGP and its affiliates be reimbursed for all direct and indirect expenses incurred or payments made on behalf of us, including, but not limited to, director fees and expenses. MGP may determine in its sole discretion the expenses that are allocable to us. Total costs billed to us by MGP and its affiliates were approximately $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. The executive officers of MGP are employees of and paid by Alliance Coal, and the reimbursement we pay to MGP pursuant to the partnership agreement does not include any compensation expenses associated with them.
​
JC Land
​
Alliance Coal has a time-sharing agreement with JC Land concerning Alliance Coal’s use of aircraft owned by JC Land. In accordance with the provisions of that agreement, Alliance Coal paid JC Land $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 for use of their aircraft.
​
Effective August 1, 2013, Alliance Coal entered into an expense reimbursement agreement with JC Land regarding pilots employed by Alliance Coal to operate aircraft owned by Alliance Service, Inc. and JC Land. In accordance with the expense reimbursement agreement, JC Land reimburses Alliance Coal for a portion of the compensation expense for its pilots. JC Land paid us $0.3 million in 2024 pursuant to this agreement. Separately, JC Land paid us $0.6 million during 2024 for fuel, pilot travel, etc. paid by us on their behalf.
​
Infinitum Electric, Inc.
​
On January 16, 2024, Matrix Design entered into an agreement with Infinitum to jointly develop and distribute high-efficiency motors and advanced motor controllers designed specifically for the mining industry.

Director Independence
​
As a publicly traded limited partnership listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, we are required to maintain a sufficient number of independent directors on the board of our general partner to satisfy the audit committee requirement set forth in NASDAQ Rule 5605(c)(2)(A). Rule 5605(c)(2)(A) requires us to maintain an audit committee of at least three members, each of whom must, among other requirements, be independent as defined under NASDAQ Rule 5605(a)(2) and meet the criteria for independence set forth in Rule 10A-3(b)(1) under the Exchange Act (subject to the exemptions provided in Rule 10A-3(c)).

Audit fees consist primarily of the audit and quarterly reviews of the consolidated financial statements, but can also be related to statutory audits of subsidiaries required by governmental or regulatory bodies, attestation services required by statute or regulation, comfort letters, consents, assistance with and review of documents filed with the SEC, work performed by tax professionals in connection with the audit and quarterly reviews, and accounting and financial reporting consultations and research work necessary to comply with GAAP. 
​
(2)
Audit-related fees consist primarily of attest services related to financial reporting that are not required by statue or regulation but can also include accounting consultations and audits in connections with acquisitions. 
​
(3)
Tax fees consist primarily of services rendered for tax compliance, tax advice, and tax planning. 
​
The charter of the Audit Committee provides that the committee is responsible for the pre-approval of all auditing services and permitted non-audit services to be performed for us by our independent registered public accounting firm, subject to the requirements of applicable law. In accordance with such charter, the Audit Committee may delegate the authority to grant such pre-approvals to the Audit Committee chairman or a sub-committee of the Audit Committee, which pre-approvals are then reviewed by the full Audit Committee at its next regular meeting. Typically, however, the Audit Committee itself reviews the matters to be approved. The Audit Committee periodically monitors the services rendered by and actual fees paid to the independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that such services are within the parameters approved by the Audit Committee.
