Overview of Coal Properties 
​
Our coal properties are located in the Illinois Basin and the Appalachia Basin. Our Illinois Basin properties are located in western Kentucky, southern Illinois, and southern Indiana. Our Appalachian properties are located in eastern Kentucky, western Maryland, western Pennsylvania, and northern West Virginia. Mining operations on our coal properties consist of underground mines that produce bituminous coal that is sold to customers principally for electric power generation (thermal) and the production of steel (metallurgical). In addition to our coal mining operations, we also hold coal mineral interests that we lease/sublease to our operations or hold for lease/sublease to our operations or others.
