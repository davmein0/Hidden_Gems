​
The stability and profitability of our operations could be adversely affected if our customers do not honor existing contracts or do not extend existing or enter into new long-term contracts for coal.
​
In 2024, we sold approximately 83.6% of our coal sales tonnage under contracts having a term greater than one year, which we refer to as long-term sales contracts. These contracts have historically provided a relatively secure market for the production committed under the terms of the contracts. From time to time industry conditions could make it more difficult for us to enter into long-term sales contracts with our electric utility customers, and if supply exceeds demand in the coal industry, electric utilities may become less willing to lock in price or quantity commitments for an extended period of time. Accordingly, we may not be able to continue to obtain long-term sales contracts with reliable customers as existing contracts expire, which could subject a portion of our revenue stream to the increased volatility of the spot market.
​
Some of our long-term sales contracts contain provisions allowing for the renegotiation of prices and, in some instances, the termination of the contract or the suspension of purchases by customers.
​
Some of our long-term sales contracts contain provisions that allow the purchase price to be renegotiated at periodic intervals. These price reopener provisions may automatically set a new price based on the prevailing market price or, in some instances, require the parties to the contract to agree on a new price. Any adjustment or renegotiation leading to a significantly lower contract price could adversely affect our operating profit margins. Accordingly, long-term sales contracts may provide only limited protection during adverse market conditions. In some circumstances, the failure of the parties to agree on a price under a reopener provision can also lead to the early termination of a contract.
​
Several of our long-term sales contracts also contain provisions that allow the customer to suspend or terminate performance under the contract upon the occurrence or continuation of certain events that are beyond the customer’s reasonable control. Such events could include labor disputes, mechanical malfunctions, and changes in government regulations, including changes in environmental regulations rendering the use of our coal inconsistent with the customer’s environmental compliance strategies. Additionally, most of our long-term sales contracts contain provisions requiring us to deliver coal within stated ranges for specific coal characteristics. Failure to meet these specifications can result in economic penalties, rejection or suspension of shipments, or termination of the contracts. In the event of early termination of any of our long-term sales contracts, if we are unable to enter into new contracts on similar terms, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.
​
We depend on a few customers for a significant portion of our revenues, and the loss of one or more significant customers could affect our ability to maintain the sales volume and price of the coal we produce.
​
In 2024, we derived more than 10% of our total revenues from each of American Electric Power Company Inc., Louisville Gas and Electric Company, and Tennessee Valley Authority. If we were to lose this or any of our significant customers without finding replacement customers willing to purchase an equivalent amount of coal on similar terms, or if these customers were to decrease the amounts of coal purchased or change the terms, including pricing terms, on which they buy coal from us, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our ability to collect payments from our customers could be impaired if their creditworthiness declines or if they fail to honor their contracts with us.
​
Our ability to receive payment for coal sold and delivered depends on the continued creditworthiness of our customers. If the creditworthiness of our customers declines significantly, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, if a customer refuses to accept shipments of our coal for which they have an existing contractual obligation, our revenues will decrease and we may have to reduce production at our mines until our customer’s contractual obligations are honored. 
​
Terrorist attacks or cyber incidents could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption, and/or financial loss. 
​
Like most companies in our industry, we have become increasingly dependent upon access to and the use of our digital technologies, including information systems, infrastructure, and cloud applications and services, to operate our businesses, process and record financial and operating data, communicate with our business partners, analyze mine and mining information, and estimate quantities of reserves and resources, as well as other activities related to our businesses. We also depend on the information systems and infrastructure of third-party vendors, contractors, and partners to support various aspects of our operations. Additionally, certain networks and systems are managed by external service providers which operate outside our direct control. This reliance introduces risks, including potential system failures, security breaches, and external attacks. Strategic targets, such as energy-related assets, could be at greater risk of future terrorist or cyber-attacks than other targets in the United States. 
​
Deliberate attacks, natural disasters, user error, or other security breaches or failures in, on or to our systems or infrastructure, or the systems or infrastructure of third parties on whom we rely could lead to the unauthorized access to, unauthorized disclosure of, restricted access to, or corruption or loss of our proprietary data and potentially sensitive data, including data related to personal information, critical operations and financial records. For example, in 2021, we discovered that certain of our computer systems were subject to a cyber incident, although it did not materially impact our business, financial position or results of operations. Following the incident, we took what we believed to be appropriate steps in response, including providing individual notifications, implementing multi-factor authentication and other security enhancements. Cybersecurity attacks are increasingly dynamic and continuously evolving, encompassing threats such as malicious software, credential stuffing, surveillance, phishing, social engineering, the use of deepfakes (highly realistic synthetic media generated by artificial intelligence), unauthorized data access attempts, and other forms of electronic security breaches. Such incidents may also result in disruptions to critical systems, data corruption, delays in production or delivery, difficulty in completing and settling transactions, misdirected wire transfers, challenges in maintaining our books and records, environmental damage, communication interruptions, increased safety risk for personnel, other operational disruptions, and third-party liability. Additionally, we may face regulatory scrutiny or penalties resulting from data privacy or cybersecurity violations in the aftermath of such incidents. The expanding regulatory framework for data protection increases the challenges of securing our information. Adhering to these changing requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs, and any real or perceived non-compliance may lead to regulatory penalties, legal action, and damage to our reputation.
​
While we maintain insurance, our insurance may not adequately protect us against all damages as a result of these occurrences. Consequently, it is possible that any of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and reputation Although we have implemented and maintain commercially reasonable security controls including by implementing detection and prevention systems, regular cybersecurity assessments, employee training programs, and incident response plans, there are no guarantees that these will be successful in preventing security threats from materializing, detecting such threats, or mitigating their impact. As cybersecurity threats grow increasingly more sophisticated, the risk of successful breaches, disruptions, or vulnerabilities persists despite our proactive efforts and we could be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents. While we have not experienced significant losses from cyberattacks so far and take steps to address emerging threats, no security system offers complete protection. Such incidents could lead to the loss of sensitive information or critical resources, regulatory penalties, reputational damage, data privacy liabilities, and substantial costs for remediation and system upgrades, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, financial position, operations, and cash flows.

We face various risks related to pandemics and similar outbreaks, which have had and may in the future have material adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations, and/or cash flows.
Pandemics, outbreaks or other public health events that are outside of our control could significantly disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial condition. The global or national outbreak of an illness or other communicable disease, or any other public health crisis, such as SARS, H1N1/09 flu, avian flu, Ebola, 
E. Coli
., measles and COVID-19, may cause disruptions to our business and operations, which may include (i) shortages of employees, (ii) unavailability of contractors or subcontractors, (iii) interruption of supplies from third parties upon which we rely, (iv) restrictions recommended or imposed by government and health authorities, including quarantines, to address an outbreak and (v) restrictions that we and our contractors, subcontractors and our customers impose, including facility shutdowns, to ensure the safety of employees.
The extent to which any future pandemic may adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable.
Although none of our employees are members of unions, our workforce may not remain union-free in the future.
​
None of our employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements. However, our workforce may not remain union-free in the future, and legislative, regulatory, or other governmental action could make it more difficult to remain union-free. If some or all of our currently union-free operations were to become unionized, it could adversely affect our productivity and increase the risk of work stoppages at our mining complexes. In addition, even if we remain union-free, our operations could still be adversely affected by work stoppages at unionized companies, particularly if union workers were to orchestrate boycotts against our operations.
​
Risks Related to Our Industries
​
Prices for oil & gas, as well as coal, are volatile and can fluctuate widely based on a number of factors beyond our control. An extended decline in the prices of such commodities could negatively impact our results of operations.
​
Our results of operations are primarily dependent upon the prices of oil & gas and coal, as well as our ability to improve productivity and control costs. The prices for oil & gas and coal depend upon factors beyond our control, including:
​
●
overall domestic and global economic conditions;
●
the supply of and demand for domestic and foreign coal;
●
the supply of and demand for oil & gas;
●
weather conditions and patterns that affect demand for coal and oil & gas, or our ability to produce coal or the ability of operators to produce oil & gas from our mineral interests;
●
supply chain and cost of raw materials for coal and oil & gas operations;
●
the adverse impact of pandemics, outbreaks and other public health events;
●
the proximity to and capacity of transportation facilities;
●
competition from other coal suppliers;
●
domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;
●
the price and availability of alternative fuels;
●
the effect of worldwide energy consumption, including the impact of technological advances on energy consumption;
●
international developments impacting the supply of coal;
●
international developments impacting the supply of oil & gas; and
●
the impact of domestic and foreign governmental laws and regulations.
​
Any adverse change in these factors could result in weaker demand and lower prices for our products. A substantial or extended decline in coal prices could materially and adversely affect us by decreasing our revenues to the extent we are not protected by the terms of existing coal supply agreements.
​

Competition within the coal industry could adversely affect our ability to sell coal. In addition, foreign currency fluctuations could adversely affect the competitiveness of our coal abroad.
​
We compete with other coal producers in various regions of the United States for domestic coal sales. In addition, we face competition from foreign and domestic producers that sell their coal in the international coal markets. The most important factors on which we compete are delivered price (
i.e.
, the cost of coal delivered to the customer, including transportation costs, which are generally paid by our customers either directly or indirectly), coal quality characteristics, contract flexibility (
e.g.
, volume optionality and multiple supply sources), and reliability of supply. Some competitors could have, among other things, larger financial and operating resources, lower per ton cost of production, or relationships with specific transportation providers. The competition among coal producers could impact our ability to retain or attract customers and could adversely impact our revenues and cash available for distribution.
​
We sell coal in the export thermal and metallurgical coal market, both of which are significantly affected by international demand and competition. Consolidation in the coal industry or current or future bankruptcy proceedings of coal competitors could adversely affect us. The prices of and demand for our coal could significantly decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, and could reduce our revenues and cash available for distribution.
​
In addition, we face competition from foreign producers that sell their coal in the export market. Potential changes to international trade agreements, trade concessions, or other political and economic arrangements could benefit coal producers operating in countries other than the United States. We could be adversely impacted on the basis of price or other factors by foreign trade policies or other arrangements that benefit competitors. In addition, coal is sold internationally in United States dollars and, as a result, general economic conditions in foreign markets and changes in foreign currency exchange rates could provide our foreign competitors with a competitive advantage. If our competitors’ currencies decline against the United States dollar or foreign purchasers’ local currencies, those competitors could be able to offer lower prices for coal to those purchasers. Furthermore, if the currencies of overseas purchasers were to significantly decline in value in comparison to the United States dollar, those purchasers may seek decreased prices for the coal we sell. Consequently, currency fluctuations could adversely affect the competitiveness of our coal in international markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
​
Changes in taxes or tariffs and other trade measures by the United States and foreign governments could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.
​
We pay certain taxes and fees related to our operations. Congress or state legislatures may seek to increase these taxes and fees that relate specifically to the coal industry. We cannot predict further developments, and such increases could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.
​
New tariffs and other trade measures could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. In response to tariffs imposed by the United States, the European Union, Canada, Mexico, and China have imposed tariffs on United States goods and services, including coal. These tariffs, along with any additional tariffs or trade restrictions that may be implemented by the United States or retaliatory trade measures or tariffs implemented by other countries, could result in reduced economic activity, increased costs in operating our business, reduced demand and changes in purchasing behaviors for thermal and metallurgical coal, limits on trade with the United States or other potentially adverse economic outcomes. Additionally, we sell coal into the export thermal and metallurgical markets. Accordingly, our international sales could also be impacted by the tariffs and other restrictions on trade between the United States and other countries. We cannot predict the impact that  new or changes in tariffs and other trade measures imposed by  the United States or other countries on United States goods, but such new or changes in trade measures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows and could reduce our revenues and cash available for distribution. Please see risk factor titled “Unexpected increases in raw material costs could significantly impair our operating profitability.” for additional information.
​
Global geopolitical tensions have caused, and may cause in the future, significant market disruptions that may lead to increased volatility in the price of commodities, including oil & gas, coal, and other sources of energy.
​
Volatility in coal and oil & gas prices has been and may continue to be heightened as a result of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, hostilities in the Middle East and the potential impact to global shipping. Globally, various governments have banned imports from Russia including commodities such as oil & gas and coal. These events have caused volatility in the 
37

Table of Contents
aforementioned commodity markets. Such conflicts and the resulting volatility may significantly affect prices for our coal and oil & gas or the cost of supplies and equipment, as well as the prices of competing sources of energy for our electric power plant customers.
​
Global geopolitical conflicts, trade and monetary sanctions, as well as any escalation of the conflict and future developments, could significantly affect worldwide market prices and demand for our coal and oil & gas and cause turmoil in the capital markets and generally in the global financial system. Additionally, the geopolitical and macroeconomic consequences of such conflicts and any associated sanctions cannot be predicted but could severely impact the world economy. If any of these events occur, the resulting political instability and societal disruption could reduce overall demand for products, causing a reduction in our revenues or an increase in our costs and thereby materially and adversely affecting our results of operations.
​
Changes in consumption patterns by utilities regarding the use of coal, including plans by utilities to shut down or move away from coal-fired generation, have affected our ability to sell the coal we produce and may do so in the future. 
​
Our business is closely linked to the demand for electricity, and any changes in coal consumption by domestic or international electric power generators would likely impact our business over the long term. The domestic electric power sector accounts for the vast majority of the total domestic coal consumption. The amount of coal consumed by the domestic electric utility industry is affected primarily by the overall demand for electricity, environmental and other governmental regulations, and the price and availability of competing fuels for power plants such as nuclear, natural gas, and fuel oil as well as alternative sources of energy. Competition from natural gas-fired plants that are relatively more efficient, less expensive to construct, and less difficult to permit than coal-fired plants has the most potential to displace a significant amount of coal-fired electric power generation in the near term, particularly from older, less efficient coal-fired powered generators.
​
Future environmental regulation of GHG emissions also could accelerate the use by utilities of fuels other than coal, although the short-term future is uncertain as policy changes develop and are implemented by the Trump Administration. In addition, federal and state mandates for increased use of electricity derived from renewable energy sources could affect demand for coal. Such mandates, combined with other incentives to use renewable energy sources such as tax credits, could make alternative fuel sources more competitive with coal. Further, far-reaching federal regulations promulgated by the EPA in the last several years, such as CSAPR and MATS, have led to the premature retirement of coal-fired generating units and a significant reduction in the amount of coal-fired generating capacity in the United States. A decrease in coal consumption by the domestic electric utility industry could adversely affect the demand for or the price of coal, which could negatively impact our results of operations and reduce our cash available for distribution.
​
Other factors, such as efficiency improvements associated with technologies powered by electricity have slowed electricity demand growth in the past, and while demand growth has grown in recent years in the U.S., could contribute to slower growth in the future. Further decreases in the demand for electricity, such as decreases that could be caused by a worsening of current economic conditions, could have a material adverse effect on the demand for coal and our business over the long term.
​
We, our customers, or the operators of our oil & gas mineral interests could be subject to litigation or regulatory fines or penalties related to climate change.
Increased attention to climate change risk has also resulted in a recent trend of governmental investigations and private litigation by state and local governmental agencies as well as private plaintiffs in an effort to hold energy companies accountable for the alleged effects of climate change. Other public nuisance lawsuits have been brought in the past against power, coal, and oil & gas companies alleging that their operations are contributing to climate change. The plaintiffs in these suits sought various remedies, including punitive and compensatory damages and injunctive relief. While the U.S. Supreme Court held that federal common law provided no basis for public nuisance claims against the defendants in those cases, tort-type liabilities remain a possibility and a source of concern. Government entities in other states (including California and New York) have brought similar claims seeking to hold a wide variety of companies that produce fossil fuels liable for the alleged impacts of the GHG emissions attributable to those fuels. Those lawsuits allege damages as a result of climate change and the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and abatement under various tort theories. Separately, litigation has been brought against certain fossil-fuel companies alleging that they have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but failed to adequately disclose such impacts to their investors or consumers. In addition, in December 2024, New York adopted a law requiring companies that emitted over one billion 
38

Table of Contents
tons of GHG emissions into the atmosphere between 2000 and 2018, with sufficient connections to the state, to pay into a “climate superfund” to support climate-related adaptation and mitigation projects. We, among others, have been identified by New York as a potentially responsible party under the law but, to date, have not received any cost recovery demands. It is uncertain whether we or others in our industry will be required to pay penalties as a result of the New York law, nor can we predict whether or not other states will adopt similar legislation in the future. To the extent we are required to pay such penalties, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. It is possible that we could be included in similar future lawsuits initiated by state and local governments as well as private claimants or subject to regulatory fines or penalties in the future.
​
Litigation resulting from disputes with our customers could result in substantial costs, liabilities, and loss of revenues.
​
From time to time, we have disputes with our customers over the provisions of coal supply contracts relating to, among other things, coal pricing, quality, quantity, and the existence of specified conditions beyond our or our customers’ control that suspend performance obligations under the particular contract. Disputes could occur in the future and we may not be able to resolve those disputes in a satisfactory manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
​
Our profitability could decline due to unanticipated mine operating conditions and other events that are not within our control and that may not be fully covered under our insurance policies.
​
Our coal mining operations are influenced by changing conditions or events that can affect production levels and costs at particular mines for varying lengths of time and, as a result, can diminish our profitability. These conditions and events include, among others:
​
●
mining and processing equipment failures and unexpected maintenance problems;
●
unavailability of required equipment;
●
prices for fuel, steel, explosives, and other supplies;
●
fines and penalties incurred as a result of alleged violations of environmental and safety laws and regulations;
●
variations in the thickness of the layer, or seam, of coal;
●
amounts of overburden, partings, rock, and other natural materials;
●
weather conditions, such as heavy rains, flooding, ice, and other natural events affecting operations, transportation, or customers;
●
accidental mine water discharges and other geological conditions;
●
fires;
●
seismic activities, ground failures, rock bursts or structural cave-ins or slides;
●
employee injuries or fatalities;
●
labor-related interruptions;
●
increased reclamation costs;
●
inability to acquire, maintain or renew mining rights or permits in a timely manner, if at all;
●
fluctuations in transportation costs and the availability or reliability of transportation; and
●
unexpected operational interruptions due to other factors.
​
These conditions have the potential to significantly impact our operating results. Prolonged disruption of production at any of our mines would result in a decrease in our revenues and profitability, which could materially adversely impact our quarterly or annual results.
​
Effective October 1, 2024, we renewed our property and casualty insurance program through September 30, 2025. Our property insurance was procured from our wholly owned captive insurance company, Wildcat Insurance. Wildcat Insurance charged certain of our subsidiaries for the premiums on this program and in return purchased reinsurance for the program in the standard market. The maximum limit in the commercial property program is $100.0 million per occurrence, excluding a $1.5 million deductible for property damage, a 75- or 90-day waiting period for underground business interruption depending on the mining complex and an additional $25.0 million overall aggregate deductible. We retained a 2.50% participating interest in our current commercial property insurance program. We can make no assurances that we will not experience significant insurance claims in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to purchase property insurance in the future. Also, exposures exist for 
39

Table of Contents
which no insurance may be available and for which we have not reserved. In addition, the insurance industry has been subject to efforts by environmental activists to restrict coverages available for fossil-fuel companies.
​
We 
could
 be unable to obtain and renew permits necessary for our coal mining operations, which could reduce our production, cash flow, and profitability.
​
Mining companies must obtain numerous governmental permits or approvals that impose strict conditions and obligations relating to various environmental and safety matters in connection with coal mining. The permitting rules are complex and can change over time. Regulatory authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance. The public has the right to comment on permit applications and otherwise participate in the permitting process, including through court intervention. Accordingly, permits required to conduct our operations may not be issued, maintained, or renewed, may not be issued or renewed in a timely fashion, or may involve requirements that restrict our ability to economically conduct our mining operations. Limitations on our ability to conduct our mining operations due to the inability to obtain or renew necessary permits or similar approvals could reduce our production, cash flow, and profitability.
