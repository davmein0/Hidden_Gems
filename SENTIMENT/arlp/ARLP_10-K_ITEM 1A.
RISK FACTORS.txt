●
Inability to obtain commercial insurance at acceptable rates could have a negative impact on our business
​
Tax Risks to Our Common Unitholders
●
Our 
tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and not being subject to a material amount of entity-level taxation. Our cash available for distribution to unitholders may be substantially reduced if we become subject to entity-level taxation as a result of the IRS treating us as a corporation or legislative, judicial, or administrative changes, and may also be reduced by any audit adjustments if imposed directly on the Partnership.
●
Even if unitholders do not receive any cash distributions from us, unitholders will be required to pay taxes on their share of our taxable income. A unitholder’s share of our taxable income may be increased as a result of the IRS successfully contesting any of the federal income tax positions we take.
●
Tax gain or loss on the disposition of our units could be more than expected and create tax liabilities for our unitholders
●
Limitation on unitholders’ ability to deduct interest expense incurred by us could create tax liabilities for our unitholders
●
Tax Exempt entities and non-U.S. unitholders face unique tax issues from owning our common units that may result in adverse tax consequences for them
●
IRS challenging our allocation of depreciation and amortization deductions and methods of prorating items of income, gain, loss, and deduction could cause adverse tax consequences
​
Risks Inherent in an Investment in Us
​
Cash distributions to unitholders are not guaranteed.
The payment and amount of any future distribution will be subject to the sole discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition and prospects, our capital requirements and access to financing, covenants associated with our debt obligations, and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant, and there can be no assurance that we will pay a distribution in the future. The amount of cash we can distribute to holders of our common units or other partnership securities each quarter principally depends on the amount of cash we generate from our operations, which fluctuates from quarter to quarter. In addition, the actual amount of cash available for distribution may depend on other factors, including capital allocation decisions, financing availability, restrictions in debt agreements, and the amount of cash reserves, if any, established by the general partner, in its discretion, for the proper conduct of our business.
Furthermore, since the amount of cash we have available for distribution is not solely a function of profitability, which will be affected by non-cash items, we may make cash distributions during periods when we record net losses and may be unable to make cash distributions during periods when we record net income. Please read “—Risks Related to our Business” for a discussion of further risks affecting our ability to generate available cash.
28

Table of Contents
We may issue an unlimited number of limited partner interests, on terms and conditions established by our general partner, without the consent of our unitholders, which will dilute your ownership interest in us and could increase the risk that we will not have sufficient available cash to make distributions.
The issuance by us of additional common units or other equity securities of equal or senior rank will have the following effects:
●
our unitholders’ proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease;
●
the amount of cash available for distribution on each unit could decrease;
●
the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit could be diminished;
●
the ratio of taxable income to distributions could increase; and
●
the market price of our common units could decline.
​
The market price of our common units could be adversely affected by sales of substantial amounts of our common units in the public markets, including sales by our existing unitholders.
​
The sale or disposition of a substantial number of our common units by our existing unitholders in the public markets could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common units or could impair our ability to obtain capital through an offering of equity securities. We do not know whether any such sales would be made in the public market or private placements, nor do we know what impact such potential or actual sales would have on our unit price in the future.
​
An increase in interest rates could cause the market price of our common units to decline.
​
Like all equity investments, an investment in our common units is subject to certain risks. In exchange for accepting these risks, investors may expect to receive a higher rate of return than would otherwise be obtainable from lower-risk investments. Accordingly, as interest rates rise, the ability of investors to obtain higher risk-adjusted rates of return by purchasing government-backed debt securities could cause a corresponding decline in demand for riskier investments generally, including yield-based equity investments such as publicly traded limited partnership interests. Reduced demand for our common units resulting from investors seeking other more favorable investment opportunities could cause the trading price of our common units to decline.
​
The credit and risk profile of our general partner and its owners could adversely affect our credit ratings and profile.
​
The credit and risk profile of our general partner or its owners may be factors in credit evaluations of us as a master limited partnership. This is because our general partner can exercise significant influence or control over our business activities, including our cash distribution policy, acquisition strategy, and business risk profile.
​
Our unitholders do not elect our general partner or vote on our general partner’s officers or directors. 
Unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation, our unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business and, therefore, limited ability to influence management’s decisions regarding our business. Unitholders did not elect our general partner and will have no right to elect our general partner on annual or other continuing bases. If our unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our general partner, they will have little ability to remove our general partner. Our general partner may not be removed except upon the vote of the holders of at least 66.7% of our outstanding units. 
Our unitholders’ voting rights are also restricted by a provision in our partnership agreement that provides that any units held by a person that owns 20.0% or more of any class of units then outstanding, other than our general partner and its affiliates, cannot be voted on any matter.
​
The control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent.
​
Our general partner may transfer its general partner interest in us to a third party in a merger or a sale of its equity securities without the consent of our unitholders. Furthermore, there is no restriction in the partnership agreement on the ability of the members of our general partner to sell or transfer all or part of their ownership interest in our general partner to a third party. The new owner or owners of our general partner would then be in a position to replace the directors and officers of our general partner and control the decisions made and actions taken by the Board of Directors and officers.
29

Table of Contents
​
Unitholders may be required to sell their units to our general partner at an undesirable time or price.
​
If at any time less than 20.0% of our outstanding common units are held by persons other than our general partner and its affiliates, our general partner will have the right to acquire all, but not less than all, of those units at a price no less than their then-current market price. As a consequence, a unitholder may be required to sell his common units at an undesirable time or price. Our general partner may assign this purchase right to any of its affiliates or us.
​
Cost reimbursements due to our general partner could be substantial and could reduce our ability to pay distributions to unitholders.
​
Before making any distributions to our unitholders, we will reimburse our general partner and its affiliates for all expenses they have incurred on our behalf. The reimbursement of these expenses and the payment of these fees could adversely affect our ability to make distributions to the unitholders. Our general partner has sole discretion to determine the amount of these expenses and fees. For additional information, please see “Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence—Related-Party Transactions—
Expense Reimbursements.
” 
​
Your liability as a limited partner may not be limited, and our unitholders could have to repay distributions or make additional contributions to us under certain circumstances.
As a limited partner in a partnership organized under Delaware law, you could be held liable for our obligations to the same extent as a general partner if you participate in the “control” of our business. Our general partner generally has unlimited liability for the obligations of the Partnership, except for those contractual obligations of the Partnership that are expressly made without recourse to our general partner. Additionally, the limitations on the liability of holders of limited partner interests for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been established in many jurisdictions.
Under certain circumstances, our unitholders could have to repay amounts wrongfully distributed to them. Under Delaware law, we may not make a distribution to our unitholders if the distribution would cause our liabilities to exceed the fair value of our assets. Delaware law provides that for three years from the date of the impermissible distribution, partners who received the distribution and who knew at the time of the distribution that it violated Delaware law will be liable to the Partnership for the distribution amount. Liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interest and liabilities that are non-recourse to the Partnership are not counted for purposes of determining whether a distribution is permitted.
​
Our partnership agreement limits our general partner
’
s fiduciary duties to our unitholders and restricts the remedies available to unitholders for actions taken by our general partner that may otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty.
​
Our partnership agreement contains provisions that waive or consent to conduct by our general partner and its affiliates and which reduce the obligations to which our general partner would otherwise be held by state-law fiduciary duty standards. The following is a summary of the material restrictions contained in our partnership agreement on the fiduciary duties owed by our general partner to the limited partners. Our partnership agreement:
​
●
permits our general partner to make many decisions in its “sole discretion.” This entitles our general partner to consider only the interests and factors that it desires, and it has no duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of, or factors affecting us, our affiliates, or any limited partner
;
●
provides that our general partner is entitled to make other decisions in its “reasonable discretion”;
●
generally provides that affiliated transactions and resolutions of conflicts of interest not involving a required vote of unitholders must be “fair and reasonable” to us and that, in determining whether a transaction or resolution is “fair and reasonable,” our general partner may consider the interests of all parties involved, including its own. Unless our general partner has acted in bad faith, the action taken by our general partner shall not constitute a breach of its fiduciary duty; and
●
provides that our general partner and our officers and directors will not be liable for monetary damages to us, our limited partners, or assignees for errors of judgment or any acts or omissions if our general partner and those other persons acted in good faith.
​

Table of Contents
All limited partners are bound by the provisions in the partnership agreement, including the provisions discussed above.
​
Our general partner’s discretion in determining the level of cash reserves may adversely affect our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.
​
Our partnership agreement requires our general partner to deduct from available cash reserves that in its reasonable discretion are necessary for the proper conduct of our business, to comply with applicable law or agreements to which we are a party, or to provide funds for future distributions to partners. These cash reserves will affect the amount of cash available for distribution to unitholders.
​
Our general partner has conflicts of interest and limited fiduciary responsibilities, which may permit our general partner to favor its interests to the detriment of our unitholders.
​
Conflicts of interest could arise in the future as a result of relationships between our general partner and its affiliates, on the one hand, and us, on the other hand. As a result of these conflicts, our general partner may favor its interests and those of its affiliates over the interests of our unitholders. The nature of these conflicts includes the following considerations:
​
●
Remedies available to our unitholders for actions that, without the limitations, could constitute breaches of fiduciary duty are limited. Unitholders are deemed to have consented to some actions and conflicts of interest that could otherwise be deemed a breach of fiduciary or other duties under applicable state law.
●
Our general partner is allowed to take into account the interests of parties in addition to us in resolving conflicts of interest, thereby limiting its fiduciary duties to our unitholders.
●
Our general partner’s affiliates are not prohibited from engaging in other businesses or activities, including those in direct competition with us, except as provided in the omnibus agreement (please see Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K).
●
Our general partner determines the amount and timing of our asset purchases and sales, capital expenditures, borrowings, and reserves, each of which can affect the amount of cash that is distributed to unitholders.
●
Our general partner determines whether to issue additional units or other equity securities in us.
●
Our general partner determines which costs are reimbursable by us.
●
Our general partner controls the enforcement of obligations owed to us by it.
●
Our general partner decides whether to retain separate counsel, accountants, or others to perform services for us.
●
Our general partner is not restricted from causing us to pay it or its affiliates for any services rendered on terms that are fair and reasonable to us or from entering into additional contractual arrangements with any of these entities on our behalf.
●
In some instances, our general partner may direct us to borrow funds to permit the payment of distributions.
​
Some of our executive officers and directors face potential conflicts of interest in managing our business.
​
Certain of our executive officers and directors are also officers and/or directors of AGP. These relationships could create conflicts of interest regarding corporate opportunities and other matters. The resolution of any such conflicts may not always be in our or our unitholders’ best interests. These officers and directors face potential conflicts regarding the allocation of their time, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
​
Increased attention to ESG matters may negatively impact our business, financial results, and unit price.
​
Companies across all industries, including companies in fossil-fuel industries, are facing increased scrutiny from stakeholders related to their ESG practices. Companies that do not adapt or comply with evolving investor or stakeholder expectations and standards, or are perceived to have not responded appropriately to ESG issues, regardless of any legal requirement to do so, may suffer reputational damage and the business, financial condition, and valuation of such companies could be adversely affected. Several advocacy groups, both domestically and internationally, have campaigned for governmental and private action to promote change at public companies related to ESG matters, including through the investment and voting practices of investment advisers, public pension funds, universities, and other members of the investing community. These activities include increased attention to and demands for action related to climate change, changes in regulation relating to climate change, promoting the use of substitutes to fossil-fuel products, encouraging the divestment of fossil-fuel equities, and pressuring lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil-
31

Table of Contents
fuel reserves. These activities could increase costs, reduce demand for our coal and hydrocarbon products, reduce our profits, increase the potential for investigations and litigation, impair our brand, limit our choices for lenders, insurance providers and business partners, and have negative impacts on our unit price and access to capital markets. 
​
In addition, certain organizations that provide ESG and other corporate risk information to investors and unitholders have developed scores and ratings to evaluate companies and investment funds based on ESG or “sustainability” metrics. Currently, there are no universal standards for such scores or ratings, but consideration of sustainability evaluations has become more broadly accepted by investors. Indeed, many investment funds focus on business practices perceived to have a less risky ESG profile and better sustainability scores when making investments, whereas other funds may use certain ESG criteria to “screen” certain sectors, such as coal or fossil fuels more generally, out of their investments. In addition, investors, particularly institutional investors, use these scores to benchmark companies against their peers and if a company is perceived as lagging, these investors may engage with companies to require improved ESG disclosure or performance, vote against a company’s management proposals or board nominees, or sell their interests in the Partnership, particularly if its ESG performance does not improve. Moreover, certain members of the broader investment community may consider a company’s sustainability scores as a reputational or other factor in making an investment decision. Companies in the energy industry, and in particular those focused on coal, natural gas, or oil extraction, often do not score as well under ESG assessments compared to companies in other industries. Consequently, a low ESG or sustainability score could result in our securities, both debt and equity, being excluded from the portfolios of certain investment funds and investors, restricting our access to capital to fund our continuing operations and growth opportunities. Additionally, to the extent ESG matters negatively impact our reputation, we may not be able to compete as effectively to recruit or retain employees, which may adversely affect our operations.
​
Certain public statements with respect to ESG matters, such as emission reduction goals, other environmental targets, or other commitments addressing certain social issues, are becoming increasingly subject to heightened scrutiny from public and governmental authorities, as well as other parties, related to the risk of potential “greenwashing,” i.e., misleading information or false claims overstating potential ESG benefits. For example, the SEC has recently taken enforcement action against companies for ESG-related misconduct, including alleged greenwashing. Certain regulators, such as the SEC and various state agencies, as well as non-governmental organizations and other private actors have also filed lawsuits under various securities and consumer protection laws alleging that certain ESG-statements, emission reduction claims, approaches to accounting for GHG emissions reductions, or other ESG-related goals, or standards were misleading, false, or otherwise deceptive. Any alleged claims of greenwashing against us or others in our industry may lead to further negative sentiment and diversion of investments. Additionally, we could face increasing costs as we attempt to comply with and navigate further ESG-related focus and scrutiny.
​
Additionally, certain employment practices and social initiatives are the subject of scrutiny by both those calling for the continued advancement of such policies, as well as those who believe they should be curbed, including government actors, and the complex regulatory and legal frameworks applicable to such initiatives continue to evolve. We cannot be certain of the impact of such regulatory, legal and other developments on our business. More recent political developments could mean that the Partnership faces increasing criticism or litigation risks from certain “anti-ESG” parties, including various governmental agencies. Such sentiment may focus on the Partnership’s environmental commitments (such as reducing GHG emissions) or its pursuit of certain employment practices or social initiatives that are alleged to be political or polarizing in nature or are alleged to violate laws based, in part, on changing priorities of, or interpretations by, federal agencies or state governments. Consideration of ESG-related factors in the Partnership’s decision-making could be subject to increasing scrutiny and objection from such anti-ESG parties. As a result, we may face increased litigation risks from private parties and governmental authorities related to our ESG-related efforts.
​
Risks Related to our Business
​
Global economic conditions or economic conditions in any of the industries in which our customers operate as well as sustained uncertainty in financial markets could have material adverse impacts on our business and financial condition that we currently cannot predict.
​
Weakness in global economic conditions or economic conditions in any of the industries we serve or in the financial markets could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition. For example:
​
●
the demand for electricity in the United States and globally 
could
 decline if economic conditions deteriorate, which 
could
 negatively impact the revenues, margins, and profitability of our business;
32

Table of Contents
●
any inability of our customers to raise capital could adversely affect their ability to honor their obligations to us; and
●
our future ability to access the capital markets 
could
 be restricted as a result of future economic conditions, which could materially impact our ability to grow our business, including the development of our coal mineral reserves and resources.
​
Growing our business could require significant amounts of financing that may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.
​
We plan to fund capital expenditures for our growth initiatives with existing cash balances, future cash flows from operations, borrowings under revolving credit and securitization facilities, and cash provided from the issuance of debt or equity. At times, weakness in the energy sector in general and coal, in particular, has significantly impacted access to the debt and equity capital markets. Accordingly, our funding plans could be negatively impacted by constraints in the capital markets as well as numerous other factors, including higher than anticipated capital expenditures or lower than expected cash flow from operations. In addition, we could be unable to refinance our current debt obligations when they expire or obtain adequate funding prior to expiry because our lending counterparties may be unwilling or unable to meet our funding needs. Furthermore, additional growth projects and expansion opportunities could develop in the future that could also require significant amounts of financing that may not be available to us on acceptable terms or in the amounts we expect, or at all.
​
Various factors could adversely impact the debt and equity capital markets as well as our credit ratings or our ability to remain in compliance with the financial covenants under our then-current debt agreements, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. If we are unable to finance our growth initiatives as expected, we could be required to seek alternative financing, the terms of which may not be attractive to us, or to revise or cancel our plans.
​
Our indebtedness 
could
 limit our ability to borrow additional funds, make distributions to unitholders, or capitalize on business opportunities.
​
We had long-term indebtedness of $490.4 million as of December 31, 2024. Our leverage may:
​
●
adversely affect our ability to finance future operations and capital needs;
●
limit our ability to pursue acquisitions and other business opportunities;
●
make our results of operations more susceptible to adverse economic or operating conditions; and
●
make it more difficult to self-insure for our workers’ compensation or black lung obligations or post collateral security therefor.
​
In addition, we have unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility. Future borrowings, under our credit facilities or otherwise, could increase our leverage.
​
Our payments of principal and interest on any indebtedness will reduce the cash available for distribution on our units. We will be prohibited from making cash distributions:
​
●
during an event of default under any of our indebtedness; or
●
if after such distribution, we fail to meet a coverage test based on the ratio of our consolidated cash flow to our consolidated fixed charges.
​
Various limitations in our debt agreements may reduce our ability to incur additional indebtedness, engage in some transactions, and capitalize on business opportunities, including the sale or disposition of certain of our mineral assets. For example, if prior to June 15, 2026, a Specified Minerals Disposition (as defined in the indenture governing the 2029 Senior Notes and which involves our oil and gas mineral interests) occurs, we will be required to make an offer to purchase up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of 2029 Senior Notes.
Any subsequent refinancing of our current indebtedness or any new indebtedness could have similar or greater restrictions. Please see “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 6 – Long-Term Debt” for further discussion.

We depend on the leadership and involvement of Joseph W. Craft III and other key personnel for the success of our business.
​
We depend on the leadership and involvement of Mr. Craft. Mr. Craft has been integral to our success, due in part to his ability to identify and develop internal growth projects and accretive acquisitions, make strategic decisions, and attract and retain key personnel. The loss of his leadership and involvement or the services of any members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
​
We and our subsidiaries are subject to various legal proceedings, which 
could
 have a material adverse effect on our business.
​
We are party to a number of legal proceedings incident to our normal business activities. There is the potential that an individual matter or the aggregation of multiple matters could have an adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations, or financial position. Please see “
