Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our Form 10-K for a discussion regarding the risks associated with the acquisitions. 
Known Trends, Demands, Commitments, Events or Uncertainties Impacting Our Business
We believe that our performance and future success depend on many factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges, including the following:
•
Investments in Technology. 
Our business model since inception has been to invest in our technology in the form of dedicated research and development. We will continue to invest in the development of our software platform to 
44
Table of Contents
deliver consumers with continually improving value and delight. Our investments include continuous enhancements to our technology we've developed over the last two decades or acquired from acquisitions, investments in data to help refine and improve our underlying algorithms and other costs to attract and retain a world-class technical workforce.
•
Revenue Growth.

Our commercial success, including acceptance and use of our applications, will depend on a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as size of the market opportunity, successful integration with original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”), competition and demand from the public and members of the conversational AI community. Our product offerings, including those offerings that we have acquired, have disruptive effects in the ways human interact with computers and we are developing new, innovative economic models and acquiring companies such as SYNQ3 and Amelia which have synergistic businesses to ours that we believe will enhance value to customers, partners and shareholders. For our revenue growth to continue, we will need to invest in sales and marketing to ensure our messaging, capabilities and offerings are well understood and valued by customers. With our primary focus on enterprise customers, we also need to align with enterprise sales cycles, which can be longer than consumer cycles. As we build new customer relationships, we continually focus on maintaining and growing our existing relationships through long-term partnerships through significant upfront investment in customer specific engineering projects. Additionally, in addition to our acquisitions of SYNQ3 and Amelia, we may look to acquire other companies in the industry to develop synergies with our existing business.
•
Cost of Revenues.
 The results of our business will depend in part on our ability to establish and increase our gross margins by scaling our business model and effectively managing our costs to produce our applications. Our revenue will be directly supported by data center investments in technology, both on premise and in the cloud. The associated workloads, along with supporting labor costs, will need to be managed effectively as we scale to improve our margins over time. Our Houndify platform is also powered by a library of over 100 content domains, including commonly used domains for points of interest, weather, flight status, sports and more.
•
Seasonality. 
Our ability to accurately forecast demand for our technology could be negatively affected by many factors, including seasonal demand. We anticipate that we will experience fluctuations in customer and user demand based on seasonality. For example, in the past, we have seen approximately one third of our revenue in the first half of the year with the remaining two thirds in the second half. Additionally, given that we address markets across several different industry verticals, the associated overall seasonality impact to us may not be consistent year-to-year.
•
Development of International Markets. 
We have rapidly expanded our capabilities and global reach. For example, we have globalized our solution to include 25 languages. We view opportunities for conversational Voice AI to be global in reach, and we expect our growth to be fueled across multiple geographies.
Components of Our Results of Operations
Revenues
SoundHound generates revenues through: (1) “Product Royalties,” meaning royalties from voice-enabled products which are driven by volume, usage or life of applicable products and are affected by number of devices, users and units of usage, (2) “Service Subscriptions,” meaning subscription revenues, derived from fixed monthly fees or fees based on usage-based revenue, revenue per query or revenue per user, and (3) “Monetization,” meaning revenues generated from focused ad targeting to users of products and services that employ our technologies. Currently, our monetization revenue is derived only from our music identification application primarily in the form of ad impression revenue — revenue generated when an ad is shown in our music identification app — and, to a lesser extent, affiliate revenue for referrals to music stores for content sales and downloads of our premium music application.
“Houndified Products,” meaning products of our customers that employ SoundHound technology, and “Houndified Services,” meaning services provided to customers related to SoundHound technology, provide our customers with access to our Houndify platform over a contractual period without taking possession of the software. This generally includes revenues derived from up-front services (“professional services”) that develop and customize the Houndify platform to fit customers’ specific needs. These professional services are included in both our Product Royalties and Service Subscriptions revenues. Non-distinct professional services are recognized over the contractual life of the contract, whereas 
45
Table of Contents
revenues from distinct professional services are recognized as the services are performed or when the services are complete depending on the arrangement.
“Amelia Software Platform” meaning our AI-based digital resource solution that enables AI in our customers’ services, ranging across multiple industries. This generally includes revenue from hosted services if the customer elects our SaaS offering, or from licensing revenue if the customer requires an on-premise solutions. Professional services are also offered and included within professional services revenue. The revenues from Amelia Software Platform are included within Service Subscriptions, and are recognized point in time or over time depending on the arrangement.
We have and may continue to experience volatility for our remaining performance obligations and deferred revenue as a result of the timing for completing our performance obligations. We had remaining performance obligations in the amount of $83.3 million as of December 31, 2024. Given the applicable contract terms, $48.9 million is expected to be recognized as revenue within one year, $32.1 million is expected to be recognized between 2 to 5 years and the remainder of $2.3 million is expected to be recognized after 5 years. Deferred revenue consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue being recognized and can fluctuate with changes in billing frequency and other factors. As a result of these factors, as well as our mix of revenue streams and billing frequencies, we do not believe that changes in our remaining performance obligations and deferred revenue in a given period are directly correlated with our revenue growth in that period.
We anticipate that we will experience fluctuations in our revenues from quarter-to-quarter due to a variety of factors, including the supply and demand of end user products such as automobiles, the size and success of our sales force and the number of users who are aware of and use our applications. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.
Operating Expenses
We classify our operating expenses into the following seven categories, which are cost of revenues, sales and marketing, research and development, general and administrative, change in fair value of contingent acquisition liabilities, amortization of intangible assets and restructuring. With respect to sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative, each expense category includes overhead, including rent and related occupancy costs, which is allocated based on headcount. We plan to continue investing to support our go-to-market strategies and customer engagement, develop our current and future applications and support our operations as a public company. While our gross margin may continue to fluctuate in the near-term due to revenue contributions from varying product mixes, as well as acquisitions, we expect it will stabilize as we continue to scale our business.
Cost of Revenues
SoundHound’s cost of revenues are comprised of direct costs associated directly with SoundHound’s revenue streams as described above. This primarily includes costs and depreciation related to hosting for cloud-based services, such as data centers, electricity charges, content fees and certain personnel-related expenses including personnel costs under call centers that are directly related to these revenue streams. Additionally, our cost of revenues also includes the amortization of developed technology acquired from SYNQ3, Amelia and other acquisition as intangible assets.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses consist of personnel-related costs of the sales and marketing team, promotional campaigns, advertising fees and other marketing related costs. Advertising costs are expensed to sales and marketing when incurred.
Research and Development
Our research and development expenses are our largest operating expense as we continue to develop our software platforms and produce new technological capabilities.
The costs of these activities consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, third-party consultants and costs associated with technological supplies and materials, along with other direct and allocated expenses such as facility costs, depreciation and other shared expenses. We expense research and development costs associated with the design and development of new products in the periods in which they are incurred. 
46
Table of Contents
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses consist of personnel-related costs, accounting and legal expenses, third-party consulting costs, insurance and allocated overhead including rent, depreciation and utilities. 
Change in Fair Value of Contingent Acquisition Liabilities
The change in fair value of contingent acquisition liabilities is related to contingent consideration from the SYNQ3 and Amelia acquisitions. The contingent consideration was determined to be liability classified and is remeasured as of each reporting period with a corresponding change in fair value recorded.
Amortization of Intangible Assets
Amortization of acquired customer relationships, tradename and conversation data is included within operating expenses and arises from the amortization of assets acquired through the acquisitions. We review intangible assets for impairment at least annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If an evaluation of recoverability is required, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows directly associated with the asset are compared with the asset’s carrying amount. If the estimated future cash flows from the use of the asset are less than the carrying value, an impairment charge would be recorded to write down the asset to its estimated fair value.
Restructuring
Restructuring expenses consisted of employee severance payments, employee benefits and share-based compensation related to reduced headcount from our restructuring plan ("Restructuring Plan") announced in January 2023. The Restructuring Plan was complete as of December 31, 2023.
Loss on Extinguishment of Debt
Loss on extinguishment of debt represents the loss associated with the repayment of the Amelia Debt in December 2024, the repayment of the Senior Secured Term Loan Credit Agreement with ACP Post OAK Credit II LLC (the "Term Loan") in June 2024 and the repayment of the 2021 note payable ("SVB March 2021 Note") and 2021 convertible note ("SCI June 2021 Note") in April 2023. See Note 10 of our notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
Interest Expense
Interest expense consists of stated interest incurred on our formerly outstanding convertible notes and term debt during the relevant periods, as well as the amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs over the life of the instruments or a shorter period if a lender can demand payment in the event certain events occur that are outside of our control.
The issuance of debt instruments with direct transaction costs, embedded derivatives and warrant instruments has resulted in debt discounts. Direct transaction costs consist of various transaction fees and third-party costs, such as bank and legal fees, that are incurred upon issuance. We expect the impact of the discounts from debt issuance costs to the interest expense will decrease due to the repayment of Amelia Debt in December 2024 and the repayment of Term Loan in June 2024.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net consists of the change in fair value related to our derivative liability, interest income and other income (expense).
Provision for Income Taxes
Income tax expense includes federal, state and foreign taxes and is based on reported income before income taxes. We are in a cumulative loss position for tax purposes based on historical earnings. As of December 31, 2024, we had $548.4 million of U.S. federal and $208.1 million of state net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will start to expire in 2025 and 2028, respectively, with the 
47
Table of Contents
exception of $403.3 million federal net operating loss carryforwards and $11.0 million state net operating loss carryforwards, which can be carried forward indefinitely. 
We had federal and state research and development credit carryforwards of $21.4 million and $13.3 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2024. The federal credits will expire starting in 2029 if not utilized. The state credits can be carried forward indefinitely. We also had Canadian SR&ED tax credits of $1.6 million, which expire starting in 2038 if not utilized.
Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and similar state tax laws, utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits may be subject to annual limitations due to certain ownership changes. Our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits could expire before utilization if subject to annual limitations.

Total revenues increased by 85% in 2024 compared to 2023. Service subscription revenue increased to $56.3 million, primarily based in the Americas, and was driven by the contribution of revenue from acquisitions. This was offset by a decrease in product royalties revenue, primarily in the Asia region, due to the minimum guarantee licensing or point in time revenue relating to Houndify Edge recognized in the previous period. 
Cost of Revenues
Cost of revenues increased by $32.0 million, or 283%, in 2024 compared to 2023. Gross margin decreased to 49% in 2024 compared to 75% in 2023 primarily due to the acquisitions of Amelia and SYNQ3, which included a mix of lower margin call center agent business from SYNQ3 and amortization of acquired intangible assets. In the past, our gross margin has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to revenue contributions from varying product mixes. However, we expect to gradually improve gross margins in the mid-term, especially as it relates the integration of Amelia and SYNQ3.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses increased by $10.2 million, or 54%, from $29.1 million in 2024 compared to $18.9 million in 2023, primarily due to an increase in 2024 of $7.8 million in personnel-related cost, $0.9 million in advertising expense, $0.8 million in consulting fees, $0.8 million in legal and professional fees, $0.4 million in travel expense, and $0.3 million in office expense. The increase was partially offset by reduction of $0.9 million in information technology and facility expenses. Included in the sales and marketing expense is an increase of $4.3 million arising from the Amelia acquisition and $0.7 million arising from the SYNQ3 acquisition, stemming from increased personnel-related costs.
Research and Development
49
Table of Contents
Research and development expenses increased by $19.1 million, or 37%, in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to an increase in 2024 of $14.0 million in personnel-related cost, $6.4 million in cloud computing, $0.6 million in consulting fees, and $0.2 million in travel expense. The increase was partially offset by reduction of $1.8 million in information technology and facility expenses, and $0.3 million in legal expense. Included in the research and development expense is an increase of $2.3 million arising from the Amelia acquisition and $3.6 million arising from the SYNQ3 acquisition, stemming from increased personnel-related costs.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses increased by $25.0 million, or 88%, in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to an increase in 2024 of $11.9 million in legal and professional fees, $10.1 million in personnel-related cost, $2.7 million in information technology and facility expenses, $0.9 million in office expense, $0.6 million in consulting fees, $0.5 million in cloud computing, $0.2 million in bad debt expense, and $0.1 million in travel expense. The SYNQ3 and Amelia Acquisitions led to increases in personnel-related costs and office expenses. This increase was partially offset by reduction of $0.9 million in property-related expense, $0.7 million in equipment rental expense, and $0.4 million in insurance expense. Included in the general and administrative expense is an increase of $3.0 million arising from the Amelia acquisition and $1.2 million arising from the SYNQ3 acquisition, stemming from increased personnel-related costs.
Change in Fair Value of Contingent Acquisition Liabilities
The change in fair value of acquisition related liabilities, which is driven by the movements in our stock price and changes in the assessed probability of achieving certain future revenue targets, was a loss of $222.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company's year-end stock price increase resulted in an increase in its fair value of contingent acquisition liabilities where future Contingent Earnout Consideration and Contingent Holdback Consideration are marked-to-market on a quarterly basis, significantly impacting net loss and EPS during the year ended December 31, 2024. The fluctuation is non-operating and non-cash in nature. We will continue to review our estimates on a quarterly basis over the remaining earnout period until 2026. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included within this report for more information.
Amortization of Intangibles Assets
Amortization of acquired developed technology is included within cost of revenues, while the amortization of other intangible assets, including acquired customer relationships, tradename and conversation data, are included within cost of revenues and amortization of intangible assets in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. All intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.

Restructuring
There were no restructuring expenses resulting from the Restructuring Plan recorded in the year ended December 31, 2024 as the Restructuring Plan was complete as of December 31, 2023, compared to $4.6 million of expenses incurred in the year ended December 31, 2023. Refer to "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for additional information.
Loss on Extinguishment of Debt
The $15.6 million increase in loss on extinguishment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2024 was attributable to a loss on the repayment of Amelia Debt in December 2024 and the repayment of Term Loan in June 2024. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included within this report for more information.
50
Table of Contents
Interest Expense
Interest expense decreased by $4.6 million, or 27%, in 2024 compared to 2023. The decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to the early repayment of Term Loan in June, 2024 and the interest expense from on our SVB March 2021 Note and SCI June 2021 Note in the year ended December 31, 2023, which were terminated at the time that the Term Loan was obtained in April 2023. The decrease in interest expense was partially offset by the increased interest expense of $2.0 million from Amelia Debt in the year ended December 31, 2024. We expect interest expense will decrease as a result of the extinguishment of Term Loan and Amelia Debt.

Interest Income
Interest income increased by $5.5 million, or 192%, in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to interest earned on greater money market and treasury bond balances during 2024 as we engaged in significant transactions that increased our liquidity. Refer to "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for a discussion of the changes in our business that led to an increase in cash for the year ended December 31, 2024.
Loss on Change in Fair Value of Equity Line of Credit Program
We recorded losses on changes in the fair value of the derivative liability associated with the ELOC (as defined below) of $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. There was no change in fair value of the derivative liability associated with the ELOC for the year ended December 31, 2024 as we sold the entirety of the 25,000,000 shares under the ELOC during the year ended December 31, 2023.
Gain on Bargain Purchase
The gain on bargain purchase of $1.2 million was recorded within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss in the year ended December 31, 2024 as a result of a favorable fair value of identifiable net assets acquired from an immaterial acquisition at the date of acquisition as compared with the purchase price.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents on hand as of December 31, 2024 was $198.2 million. Although we have incurred recurring losses each year since its inception, we expect we will be able to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months. We believe we will meet longer-term expected future cash requirements and obligations through a combination of cash flows from operating activities, available cash balances and expected cash proceeds from the future at-the-market equity program. See Note 23 to our consolidated financial statements included within this report for more information on the cash proceeds from the at-the-market equity program launched subsequent to December 31, 2024. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.
Sources of Cash and Material Cash Requirements 
Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, which are sourced primarily from the sale of marketable securities. The primary uses of cash include the funding of operating expenses, as well as acquisition related costs.

proceeds from sales of Class A common stock was $117.0 million 
during the 
year ended December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had no remaining capacity to sell the Company's Class A common stock under the Execute Equity Distribution Agreement. 
SYNQ3 Acquisition
On January 3, 2024 (the "SYNQ3 Acquisition Date"), we acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity of SYNQ3, a leading provider of voice AI and other technology solutions to the restaurant industry, for total purchase consideration of $15.8 million (the “SYNQ3 Acquisition”). 
The total purchase consideration includes $3.9 million in cash paid and 5,755,910 in shares of our Class A Common Stock issued as of the SYNQ3 Acquisition Date. We also withheld purchase consideration of $0.5 million in cash and 1,179,514 shares of our Class A Common Stock, subject to customary net working capital adjustments, to partially secure the indemnification obligations of SYNQ3's former stockholders under the merger agreement and agreed to pay up to $0.8 million in cash and 1,434,936 in shares of our Class A Common Stock to certain former stockholders of SYNQ3 based upon the achievement of specified future milestones. We also issued 2,033,156 restricted shares of our Class A Common Stock subject to time and performance-based vesting conditions.
We incurred $2.1 million in acquisition related expenses, of which $1.0 million were incurred during the year ended December 31, 2024 and recorded as general and administration expenses in its consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 
Holdback
The $0.5 million in cash and 1,179,514 shares of our Class A Common Stock is being withheld for a period of 15 months (the “Holdback Amount”). We determined that there are two components to the Holdback Amount related to deferred consideration and contingent consideration, each comprised of cash and shares. 
The deferred cash holdback consideration of $0.1 million and the deferred share holdback consideration of 361,145 shares of our Class A Common Stock (collectively, the “Deferred Consideration”) were not recognized as of the SYNQ3 Acquisition Date as such amounts were offset by the indemnification obligations of SYNQ3's former stockholders. 
The contingent cash and share holdback consideration to be issued is variable (“Contingent Holdback Consideration”). Final amounts to be issued will be reduced based upon future actions and settlements with third parties to resolve assumed contingent sales tax liabilities and certain other assumed contingent liabilities of SYNQ3 in connection with the SYNQ3 Acquisition. We accounted for the Contingent Holdback Consideration as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet. As of the SYNQ3 Acquisition Date, the Contingent Holdback Consideration was estimated to be $0.6 million in aggregate and to be settled in $0.1 million cash and the remainder in shares of our Class A Common Stock. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we issued 38,277 shares of our Class A Common Stock and paid an immaterial amount in cash from the Contingent Holdback Consideration to SYNQ3's former stockholders as a result of the net working capital adjustments settled during the year. The Contingent Holdback Consideration will be subsequently remeasured at each reporting date with changes in fair value recognized as a component of operating expense on our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized a loss of $3.7 million related to the Contingent Holdback Consideration. 
Contingent SYNQ3 Earnout Consideration
We also agreed to pay in aggregate up to $0.8 million in cash and 1,434,936 in shares of Class A Common Stock, to certain stockholders of SYNQ3 based on tiered annual revenue targets for each fiscal year 2024, 2025 and 2026 (the “Contingent SYNQ3 Earnout Consideration”). We accounted for the Contingent SYNQ3 Earnout Consideration as a liability within contingent acquisition liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and will subsequently remeasure the liability at each reporting date with changes in fair value recognized as a component of operating expense in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. As of the SYNQ3 Acquisition Date, the Contingent SYNQ3 Earnout Consideration was estimated to be $1.7 million in aggregate and to be settled in $0.2 million cash and the remainder in shares of our Class A Common Stock. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized a loss of $7.0 million related to the Contingent SYNQ3 Earnout Consideration, reflected in the change in fair value of contingent acquisition liabilities in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. As of December 31, 2024, the

2024 revenue target was not met but we assessed the 2025 and 2026 revenue target were probable of being met, and no earnout consideration was issued during the year ended December 31, 2024.
Restricted stock awards
The 2,033,156 restricted shares of our Class A Common Stock issued at the SYNQ3 Acquisition Date to certain continuing employees of SYNQ3 subject to time and performance-based vesting conditions was determined to be a separate transaction from the SYNQ3 Acquisition and therefore is excluded from purchase consideration.
Restricted stock units
As a condition of the SYNQ3 Acquisition, we additionally granted certain employees awards with future vesting conditions. As a result, we determined that these awards should be accounted for separately from the SYNQ3 Acquisition and therefore are excluded from purchase consideration.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded measurement period adjustments to decrease the deferred revenue by $0.1 million as the revenue recognition criteria had been met at the acquisition date and to increase the accrued liabilities by $1.8 million resulting from a pre-acquisition legal settlement, and to decrease the deferred tax liability assumed by $0.2 million. Refer to Note 8 to these consolidated financial statements for more information on the legal proceedings. These measurement period adjustments resulted in a decrease of $0.1 million in deferred cash consideration, $0.6 million in deferred equity consideration, and $0.4 million in contingent holdback consideration in accordance with the merger agreement. As a result of the adjusted acquisition-date fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we recorded an increase of $0.2 million to the goodwill recognized. The measurement period adjustments were recorded in the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024 and were made to reflect facts and circumstances that existed as of the SYNQ3 Acquisition Date. The purchase price allocation has been finalized as of December 31, 2024.
Amelia Acquisition
On August 6, 2024 (the “Amelia Acquisition Date”), we completed the acquisition of Amelia Holdings, Inc. (the “Amelia Acquisition”), a privately-held conversational AI software company involved in the development and delivery of AI and automation solutions and related services to improve customer experience and optimize business outcomes. 
On the Amelia Acquisition Date, we issued a total of 3,809,520 shares of the SoundHound Class A common stock to the sellers. Pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement, we also issued and deposited 2,149,530 shares of the SoundHound Class A common stock into an escrow account in order to partially secure the indemnification obligations of the selling shareholders under the purchase agreement. We also paid $8.4 million of cash for seller transaction expenses in connection with the closing of the Amelia Acquisition. We agreed to issue up to 16,822,429 shares to the selling shareholders based on achievement of certain revenue targets in fiscal years 2025 and 2026. The fair value of the preliminary purchase consideration was $98.6 million.
In connection with the Amelia Acquisition, we assumed the amended senior secured term loan facility from Amelia in an aggregate principal amount of $121.5 million (“Amelia Debt”). See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included within this report for more information on the Amelia Debt.
Escrow Consideration
On the Amelia Acquisition Date, we issued and deposited 2,149,530 shares of our Class A Common Stock into and escrow account in order to partially secure the indemnification obligations of the selling shareholders under the purchase agreement. We accounted for the escrow consideration as equity issued as part of consideration transferred. Upon the settlement of any valid indemnification claims against the sellers, the escrow agent will return a number of shares to us equal to the dollar value of the indemnified loss divided by the reference price of $5.35 as stipulated in the purchase agreement. We concluded that this variability in settlement value is a derivative that is requirement to be remeasured to fair value due to changes in stock price. This derivative did not have a material impact to the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024. Upon the expiration of the escrow period, any remaining shares in the escrow account will be released to the selling shareholders.

Contingent Amelia Earnout Consideration
We agreed to pay up to 16,822,429 in shares of Class A Common Stock to the selling shareholders based on achievement of certain revenue targets in fiscal years 2025 and 2026 (the “Contingent Amelia Earnout Consideration”). We accounted for the Contingent Amelia Earnout Consideration as a liability within contingent acquisition liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet and will subsequently remeasure the liability at each reporting date with changes in fair value recognized as a component of operating expense in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. As of the Amelia Acquisition Date, the Contingent Amelia Earnout Consideration had an estimated fair value of 
$66.3 million
 and will be settled in shares of our Class A Common Stock. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized 
a $211.9 million loss
 related to the Contingent Amelia Earnout Consideration, reflected in the change in fair value of contingent acquisition liabilities in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included within this report for more information on the fair value measurement of Contingent Amalia Earnout Consideration. As of December 31, 2024, we assessed the 2025 and 2026 revenue target were probable of being met.
The preliminary purchase price allocation has not been finalized as of December 31, 2024 primarily due to the final assessment of the fair values of the intangible assets, contingent tax liability assumed and fair value of the contingent acquisition liabilities. The fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is pending the completion of various items, including obtaining further information regarding the identification and valuation of all assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Any adjustments to the estimates of purchase price allocation will be made in the periods in which the adjustments are determined, and the cumulative effect of such adjustments will be calculated as if the adjustments had been completed as of the acquisition date. We expect to finalize the purchase price allocation within 12 months from the Amelia Acquisition Date.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded measurement period adjustments to increase the cash consideration by $12.8 thousand, to decrease the accounts receivable by $0.2 million, increase the accrued liabilities by $0.9 million due to additional payroll taxes identified, to decrease the non-current income tax liabilities by $1.8 million due to the change of pre-acquisition tax exposures subsequent to the acquisition. As a result of the adjusted acquisition-date fair value of cash consideration, assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we recorded a decrease of $0.7 million to the goodwill recognized. The measurement period adjustments were recorded in the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024 and were made to reflect facts and circumstances that existed as of the Amelia Acquisition Date. In addition to the measurement period adjustments, we also recorded adjustments to correct certain errors in the preliminary purchase price allocation that existed as of the acquisition date during the year ended December 31, 2024, which decreased the contingent earnout consideration by $5.3 million, decreased the accounts payable by $3.7 million, decreased the accrued liabilities by $1.2 million, increased deferred revenue by $0.3 million and increased the deferred tax liabilities by $0.7 million. As a result of the adjusted acquisition-date fair value of contingent earnout consideration recognized, assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we recorded a decrease of $9.3 million to the goodwill recognized. The identified error related to the contingent earnout consideration had an immaterial impact to the change in fair value from the acquisition date through September 30, 2024, which would have been recorded in change in fair value of contingent acquisition liabilities in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
Other Acquisition
On June 14, 2024, we completed an immaterial acquisition for total preliminary purchase consideration of 
$1.0 million
. As part of the acquisition, we acquired net assets of 
$2.2 million
, including intangible assets of 
$2.6 million
, and recognized a preliminary gain on bargain purchase of 
$1.2 million
 within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss during the year ended December 31, 2024, resulting from a favorable fair value of identifiable net assets acquired at the date of acquisition as compared with the purchase price. We were able to negotiate a bargain purchase price as a result of the recurring losses and pre-filing bankruptcy status of the selling entity.

Sales Agreement
On

July 28, 2023
, we entered into the Sales Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC, and D.A. Davidson & Co., pursuant to which we were able to offer and sell up to 
$150.0 million
 of shares of our Class A Common Stock from time to time through or to the sales agents acting as agent or principal. Sales of our Class A Common Stock under the Sales Agreement were made at market prices by any method that is deemed to be an “at the market offering” as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act. The sales agents were entitled to aggregate compensation at a fixed commission rate of 2.5% of the gross sales price per share sold under the Sales Agreement. We agreed to reimburse the sales agents for certain specified expenses, including the reasonable and documented fees and disbursements of its legal counsel in an amount of $75 thousand in the aggregate in connection with the execution of the Sales Agreement.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we sold a total of 37,907,219 shares of our Class A common stock under the Sales Agreement at a weighted-average price of $3.62 per share and raised $137.3 million of gross proceeds, which resulted in complete utilization of the Sales Agreement as of March 31, 2024. After deducting approximately $3.4 million of commissions and offering costs incurred by us, the net proceeds from sales of Class A common stock was $133.8 million.
Debt Financing
On April 14, 2023 (the “Term Loan Closing Date”), we entered into a Senior Secured Term Loan Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with ACP Post Oak Credit II LLC, as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent for the Lenders (the “Agent”), and the lenders from time to time party thereto (the “Lenders”). The Credit Agreement provided for a term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to 
$100.0 million
, the entirety of which was funded on the Term Loan Closing Date. 
 As of 
June 30, 2024,
 the interest rate was approximately 
14.0%
. Subject to certain exceptions as set forth in the Credit Agreement, interest on the Term Loan is payable quarterly in arrears on the last business day of each fiscal quarter. The Term Loan was set to mature on April 14, 2027 (the “Maturity Date”). The Credit Agreement provided for no scheduled principal payments prior to the Maturity Date. Refer to Note 10 of the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the Credit Agreement, and amortization of the debt issuance cost and debt discount.
On June 7, 2024, we entered into a letter agreement (the “Payoff Letter”) to prepay in full all indebtedness and other amounts outstanding and owing under the Credit Agreement. In connection with the Term Loan prepayment, we paid a total of 
$105.6 million
 on June 7, 2024, which consisted of (i) the remaining principal amount outstanding of 
$100.0 million
, (ii) a prepayment premium of 
$5.0 million
, (iii) transaction expenses of 
$0.6 million
, resulting in a loss on debt extinguishment of 
$15.6 million
. Accordingly, the accrued and unpaid interest of 
$2.6 million
 was waived under the Payoff Letter.
Amelia Debt
In
 connection with the Amelia Acquisition, we assumed the amended senior secured term loan facility from Amelia in an aggregate principal amount of $121.5 million (“Amelia Debt”) and on August 7, 2024, we paid $70.0 million in cash to pay down a portion of the outstanding principal balance and issued 2,943,917 shares of Class A common stock to settle certain fees associated with the Amelia Debt. The remaining outstanding balance of $39.7 million had a maturity date of June 30, 2026 (the “Maturity Date”) and provided, at our election, for payment of a portion of interest in cash or in kind ("PIK"), in which case interest would be capitalized and added to the outstanding principal amount, with principal and accrued interest due at the Maturity Date. 
On December 3, 2024
, we entered into a letter agreement (the “Amelia Debt Payoff Letter”) to prepay in full all indebtedness and other amounts outstanding and owing under the Amelia Debt Credit Agreement. 
In connection with the Amelia Debt prepayment, we paid a total of $39.8 million on December 4, 2024, which consisted of the remaining principal amount outstanding of $39.8 million and transaction expenses of $42 thousand, resulting in a loss on debt

Equity Line of Credit (ELOC)
On August 16, 2022, we entered into a common stock purchase agreement (the “Common Stock Purchase Agreement”) and related registration rights agreement (the “CFPI Registration Rights Agreement”) with CF Principal Investments LLC (the “Counterparty”). Pursuant to the Common Stock Purchase Agreement, we had the right to sell to the Counterparty up to the lesser of (i) 25,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock and (ii) the Exchange Cap (as defined in the Common Stock Purchase Agreement), subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the Common Stock Purchase Agreement (the "ELOC Shares"). On February 14, 2023, our Registration Statement on Form S-1 registering the resale of the ELOC Shares (the "ELOC Registration Statement") was declared effective. On March 31, 2023, a post-effective amendment to the ELOC Registration Statement was declared effective. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we sold the entirety of the 25,000,000 shares under the ELOC program for aggregate proceeds of approximately $71.7 million.
Series A Preferred Stock
On or around January 20, 2023, we entered into Preferred Stock Purchase Agreements with certain investors (the "Investors"), pursuant to which we issued and sold to the Investors an aggregate of 835,011 shares of our newly designated Series A Convertible Preferred Stock for an aggregate issue price of approximately $25.0 million.
Each share of Series A Preferred Stock was convertible, at the option of the holder, into such number of shares of Class A Common Stock equal to the liquidation preference per share ("Liquidation Preference") at the time of conversion divided by $1.00 (the “Conversion Price”). In addition, each share of Series A Preferred Stock would automatically convert into shares of Class A Common Stock at the Conversion Price on or after January 20, 2024 if and when the daily volume-weighted average closing price per share of Class A Common Stock is at least 2.5 times the Conversion Price for each of any 90 trading days during any 120 consecutive trading day period, which 120-trading day period may commence (but may not end) prior to January 20, 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2024, 475,005 shares of preferred stock were converted into 16,624,215 shares of Class A Common Stock. The conversion was pursuant to the original terms of the agreement and therefore the carrying value of Series A Preferred Stock was converted into Class A Common Stock with no gain or loss upon conversion. 
As of December 31, 2024, all the Series A Preferred Stock have been converted to Class A Common Stock.
The holders of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled to cumulative dividends payable for such share at the rate of 14% per annum, compounding semi-annually to Liquidation Preference on January 1 and July 1 of each year. Total cumulative dividends attributable to Series A Preferred Stock for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $0.4 million. 
Contractual and Other Obligations
Because we expect to continue investing in software application and development, we enter into various contracts and agreements to increase our availability of capital. Cash that is received through these obligations is used to meet both short- and long-term liquidity requirements as discussed above. These requirements generally include funding for the research and development of software, the development of applications that enable voice interaction, marketing programs and personnel-related costs. The primary types of obligations into which we enter include contractual obligations, operating and finance lease obligations and a diversified spread of debt instruments. See Note 8, Note 10 and Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.

Cash Flows Used in Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities was $108.9 million during 2024 compared to $68.3 million during 2023.The $40.6 million decrease in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to our increased net loss of $261.7 million, a net decrease in changes in operating assets and liabilities of $15.8 million, an increase in deferred income taxes of $12.2 million resulting from the tax benefit from acquisitions, a decrease in amortization of debt issuance cost of $3.8 million, a decrease in loss on change in fair value of ELOC program of $1.9 million, and a decrease in non-cash lease amortization of $0.7 million, a net increase in other non-cash loss of $0.7 million, and an increase in foreign currency gain from remeasurement of $0.2 million. This was partially offset by an increase of $222.7 million in change in the fair value of contingent acquisition liabilities, $14.8 million in loss on early extinguishment of debt, $13.7 million in depreciation and amortization, and $5.2 million in stock-based compensation. The main driver for the increased operating cash outflow was the acquisitions closed during 2024, which resulted in the higher operating expenses, such as personnel related costs and acquisition related costs, compared to the prior year. 
Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $12.4 million during 2024 compared to $0.4 million during 2023. The $12.0 million increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by the payments related to acquisitions of $11.7 million and an increase in purchases of property and equipment of $0.2 million.
Cash Flows Provided by Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $210.9 million during 2024 compared to $168.2 million during 2023. The $42.7 million increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the $384.5 million increase in net proceeds from sales of Class A Common Stock under the Sales Agreement, Equity Distribution Agreement and Execute Equity Distribution Agreement, and an increase of $29.7 million in proceeds from exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plan. This was partially offset by the $215.4 million of the repayment of Term Loan and Amelia Debt during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the $35.0 million of the repayment of SVB March 2021 Note and the SCI June 2021 Note during the year ended December 31, 2023, $71.6 million decrease in net proceeds from sales of Class A Common Stock under the ELOC program during the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $85.1 million in net proceeds from the issuance of Term Loan, a decrease of $24.9 million in net proceeds from the one-time issuance of Series A Preferred Stock, and a decrease of $9.4 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock during the year ended December 31, 2024.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.
Indemnification Agreements
We enter into standard indemnification arrangements in the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these arrangements, we indemnify, hold harmless and agree to reimburse the indemnified parties for losses suffered or incurred 
58
Table of Contents
by the indemnified party, in connection with any trade secret, copyright, patent or other intellectual property infringement claim by any third party with respect to its technology. The term of these indemnification agreements is generally perpetual any time after the execution of the agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these arrangements is not determinable. Additionally, we have, and may in the future, indemnify third parties in connection with our issuance of securities (including pursuant to our at-the-market offering program) and in connection with acquisitions of other companies. Our liability is generally limited to the aggregate amount of consideration actually received in these instances. We have never incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements. As a result, we believe the fair value of these agreements is minimal.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Management Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report that have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported income (loss) generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgement about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and any such differences may be material. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results.
We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, derivative liabilities, warrant liabilities, stock-based compensation, business combinations, contingent consideration, goodwill, and intangible assets with definite lives, have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. These areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates, and consequently, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. 
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue with customers in accordance with ASC Topic 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
. We primarily derive revenue from the following performance obligations: (1) hosted services, (2) professional services, (3) monetization, and (4) licensing. We apply significant judgement in identifying and evaluating any terms and conditions in contracts which may impact revenue recognition.
Hosted Services
Hosted services, along with non-distinct customization, integration, maintenance and support professional services, allow customers to access the Houndify and Amelia software platform over the contract period without taking possession of the software. 
We have determined that the hosted services arrangements are a single performance obligation comprised of a series of distinct services, since each day of providing access to hosted services is substantially the same and the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as access is provided. These services are provided either on a usage basis (i.e., variable consideration) or on a fixed fee subscription basis. We recognize revenue as each distinct service period is performed.
Hosted services generally include up-front services to develop and/or customize the application to each customer’s specification. Judgement is required to determine whether these professional services are distinct from the hosted services. In making this determination, factors such as the degree of integration, the customers’ ability to start using the software prior to customization, and the availability of these services from other independent vendors are considered.
In instances where we concluded that the up-front services are not distinct performance obligations, revenue for these activities is recognized over the period which the hosted services are provided and is included within hosted services revenue.
All revenues derived as a result of the SYNQ3 Acquisition, and substantial revenues derived as a result of the Amelia Acquisition are categorized as hosted services revenue.
59
Table of Contents
Professional Services
Revenue from distinct professional services, such as non-integrated development services and other professional services, are either recognized over time based upon the progress towards completion of the project, or at a point in time at project completion, depending on the nature of the arrangement. Measuring the stage of completion of a project requires significant judgement and estimates, including actual efforts spent in relation to estimated total costs, and percentage of completion based on input and output measures.
Monetization
Monetization revenues are primarily derived from advertising payments associated with ad impressions placed on the SoundHound music identification application. The amount of revenue is based on actual monetization generated or usage, which represents variable consideration with the constrained estimate. Therefore, we recognize the related revenues when advertisements are placed, when commissions are paid, or when the SoundHound application is downloaded. The determination of whether revenue should be reported on a gross or net basis is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as a principal or an agent in the transaction. We have determined that we do not act as the principal in monetization arrangements because we do not control the transfer of the service and it does not set the price. Based on these factors, we report revenue on a net basis.
Licensing
We license voice and Amelia's software solutions that are embedded in customers' products or services. Licensing revenue is a distinct performance obligation that is recognized when control is transferred to the customer, which is at a point in time for non-customized solutions. For licenses with non-distinct customized solutions, revenues are recognized over time based on the progress towards completion of the customized solution. Revenues generated from licensing are on usage-based arrangements with a per unit pricing or on fixed considerations. The Company records licensing revenue relating to usage-based royalty arrangements in the same period in which the underlying usage occurs. Licensing revenue on fixed considerations including fixed fee and minimum guarantee from usage-based arrangements are recognized when the Company grants the customer the right to use and benefit from the license at the start of the licensing period. Licenses may include post-contract support, which is a distinct performance obligation and revenue from post-contract support is recognized ratably over the licensing period. 
When a contract has multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative estimated standalone selling price (“SSP”). Judgments are required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. SSP is determined by maximizing observable inputs from pricing of standalone sales, when possible. Since prices vary from customer to customer based on customer relationship, volume discount and contract type, in instances where the SSP is not directly observable, we estimate SSP by considering the following factors:
•
Costs of developing and supplying each performance obligation;
•
Industry standards;
•
Major product groupings; and
•
Gross margin objectives and pricing practices, such as contractually stated prices, discounts offered and applicable price lists.
These factors may vary over time, depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. If the facts and circumstances underlying the factors considered change or should future facts and circumstances lead us to consider additional factors, our best estimate of SSP may also change. When such observable data is not available because there is a limited number of transactions or prices are highly variable, the Company will estimate the standalone selling price using the residual approach.
Common Stock Offerings
We enter into certain agreements to sell common stock with counterparties to further support our growth strategy through initiatives such as accretive acquisitions and internal investments, to bolster working capital and for general corporate purposes. We evaluate our common stock purchase agreements to determine whether they are indexed to our own 
60

common stock, and therefore whether they should be accounted for as derivatives with changes in fair value as other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss in the period in which they occur. We subsequently assess the changes in the fair value of the derivative liability and record these changes through profit or loss in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
Warrants
We determine whether to classify contracts, such as warrants, that may be settled in our own stock as equity of the entity or as a liability. An equity-linked financial instrument must be considered indexed to the Company's own stock to qualify for equity classification. We classify warrants as liabilities for any contracts that may require a transfer of assets. Warrants classified as liabilities are accounted for at fair value and remeasured at each reporting date until exercise, expiration or modification that results in equity classification. Any change in the fair value of the warrants is recognized as other expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 
Stock-Based Compensation
We measure stock options and other stock-based awards granted to employees, directors and other service providers based on their fair value on the date of grant and recognize compensation expense of those awards over the requisite service period. We recognize the impact of forfeitures on stock-based compensation expense as forfeitures occur. We apply the straight-line method of expense recognition. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and ESPP shares. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions to determine the fair value of the awards, including the expected term of the award and the price volatility of the underlying stock. We calculate the fair value of the awards by using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:
Expected Volatility
 — We estimate volatility for the awards by evaluating the average historical volatility of a peer group of companies for the period immediately preceding the award grant for a term that is approximately equal to the awards’ expected term.
Expected Term
 — The expected term of the awards represents the period that the stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. We have elected to use the midpoint between the stock options’ vesting term and contractual expiration period to compute the expected term, as we do not have sufficient historical information to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns and post-vesting employment termination behavior. For the valuation of ESPP shares, we use the period of time from the valuation date to the purchase date.   
Risk-Free Interest Rate
 — The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a term that is equal to the awards' expected term at the grant date.
Expected Dividend Yield
 — The Company has not declared or paid dividends to date and does not anticipate declaring dividends. As such, expected dividend yield is zero.
Business Combinations and Contingent Consideration
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. We allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Fair value of the acquired intangible assets was determined using an income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings method, relief-from-royalty method, or the with-and-without method, depending on the nature of the respective assets. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but the estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. The significant judgments and assumptions used in valuing the developed technology include revenue growth rates, prospective financial information for cost of sales, research and development expenses and, other operating expenses, the discount rate, the technological obsolescence rate, and contributory asset charges. For customer relationships, the significant judgments and assumptions include revenue growth rates, customer attrition rate, prospective financial information for cost of sales and fixed and variable operating expenses and the discount rate. These estimates are inherently uncertain and, therefore, actual results may differ from the estimates made. As a result, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, we may make adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the measurement period's conclusion or final determination of the fair value of the purchase price of an 
61
Table of Contents
acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations in the period they are identified. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred.
Certain business combinations include contingent consideration arrangements, which are generally based on achievement of future financial performance or future events. If it is determined the contingent consideration arrangement is not compensatory, we estimate fair value of contingent consideration payments as part of the initial purchase price and record the estimated fair value of contingent consideration as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet. We review and assess the estimated fair value of contingent consideration each reporting period, and the updated fair value could differ materially from the initial estimates. Adjustments to estimated fair value related to changes in fair value are reported as change in fair value of contingent acquisition liabilities in our consolidated statements of operations. 
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but tested annually for impairment or when indicators of impairment are present. The test for goodwill impairment involves a qualitative assessment of impairment indicators. If indicators are present, a quantitative test of impairment is performed. Goodwill impairment, if any, is determined by comparing the reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying value. An impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying value over its fair value, up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Our policy is to review goodwill for impairment annually on October 1st unless a triggering event requires an analysis sooner. There was no goodwill impairment for the year ended December 31, 2024.
Intangible Assets with Definite Lives
Our intangible assets consist principally of developed technology, customer relationships, tradename, and conversation data. We assess the appropriate method of amortization of the intangible assets that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed. We determined that a straight-line method of amortization was appropriate for its intangible assets. The remaining useful lives of long-lived assets are re-assessed periodically at the asset group level for any events and circumstances that may change the future cash flows expected to be generated from the long-lived asset or asset group. 
Intangible assets with definite lives are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a specific asset or asset group may not be recoverable. We assess the recoverability of intangible assets with definite lives at the asset group level. Asset groups are determined based upon the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For the purpose of the recoverability test, we compare the total undiscounted future cash flows from the use and disposition of the assets with its net carrying amount. When the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows, the asset group is deemed to be impaired. The amount of the impairment loss represents the excess of the asset or asset group’s carrying value over its estimated fair value, which is generally determined based upon the present value of estimated future pre-tax cash flows that a market participant would expect from use and disposition of the long-lived asset or asset group. There were no intangible asset impairments in any of the periods presented.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are exposed to certain market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 
Foreign Exchange Risk
Ou
r financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, which is also the functional currency for our foreign operations. Where transactions may be denominated in foreign currencies, we are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in

Table of Contents
the relative value of currencies. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we recorded the exchange rate losses of approximately $0.7 million and $0.5 million, respectively. We
 do not believe that an immediate 10% increase or decrease in the relative value of the U.S. dollar to other currencies would have a material effect on operating results.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of SoundHound AI, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, of redeemable convertible preferred stock and stockholders' equity (deficit) and of cash flows for the years then ended, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company did not maintain, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the COSO because material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting existed as of that date related to the Company not designing and maintaining (i) an effective control environment due to insufficient oversight of activities related to internal control over financial reporting due to lack of an appropriate level of experience and training commensurate with the Company’s financial reporting requirements, (ii) effective controls to respond to changes to the risks of material misstatement to financial reporting which resulted in the Company, including the SYNQ3 and Amelia entities which were acquired during 2024, not designing and maintaining effective controls related to substantially all accounts and disclosures, (iii) effective controls to identify and appropriately account for certain non-routine, unusual or complex transactions, including accounting for complex financing transactions and acquisitions, (iv) effective controls to verify appropriate segregation of duties, including assessment of incompatible duties and addressing conflicts on a timely basis, and (v) effective controls over certain information technology general controls over information systems that are relevant to the preparation of the Company’s financial statements, including not maintaining user access controls, program change management controls, and computer operations controls.
A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses referred to above are described in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. We considered these material weaknesses in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2024 consolidated financial statements, and our opinion regarding the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting does not affect our opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in management's report referred to above. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding 
65
Table of Contents
the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below

are matters

arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
Revenue recognition
As described in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company derives its revenue primarily from the following performance obligations: (1) hosted services, (2) professional services, (3) monetization and (4) licensing. Contracts are accounted for by management when the parties have approved and committed to the contract, the rights of the parties and payment terms are identifiable, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. Revenues are generally recognized upon the transfer of control of promised products or services provided to customers, reflecting the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive for those products or services. Management applies significant judgment in identifying and evaluating terms and conditions in contracts which impact revenue recognition. The Company’s consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $84.7 million.  
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in identifying and evaluating terms and conditions in contracts with customers which impact revenue recognition and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to revenue recognition. As described in the “Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting” section, material weaknesses were identified related to this matter. 
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included, among others, (i) evaluating and determining the nature and extent of audit procedures performed and evidence obtained that are responsive to the material weaknesses identified; (ii) obtaining an understanding of management’s process for identifying and evaluating terms and conditions in contracts, including evaluating management’s determination of the impact of those terms and conditions on revenue recognition; (iii) testing, on a sample 
66
Table of Contents
basis, (a) the completeness and accuracy of management’s identification and evaluation of terms and conditions by examining contracts and (b) revenue transactions by obtaining and inspecting source documents, such as contracts, purchase orders, invoices, proof of delivery, and subsequent cash receipts; (iv) testing, on a sample basis, the timing of recognition of revenue transactions; and (v) testing, on a sample basis, the determination of the standalone selling price of performance obligations and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by management in determining standalone selling price of performance obligations.  
Acquisition of Amelia Holdings, Inc. – Valuation of Developed Technology and Customer Relationships 
As described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, on August 6, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Amelia Holdings, Inc. (Amelia) for total consideration of $98.6 million. Of the acquired intangible assets, $98.9 million of developed technology and $68.6 million of customer relationships were recorded. Fair value of the acquired intangible assets was determined using an income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings method or the with-and-without method, depending on the nature of the respective asset. The significant judgments and assumptions used in valuing the developed technology include revenue growth rates, prospective financial information for cost of sales, research and development expenses and other operating expenses, the discount rate, the technological obsolescence rate, and contributory asset charges. For customer relationships, the significant judgments and assumptions include the discount rate, revenue growth rates, and prospective financial information for cost of sales and fixed and variable operating expenses. 
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of the developed technology and customer relationships acquired in the acquisition of Amelia are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the developed technology and customer relationships acquired; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to revenue growth rates, prospective financial information for cost of sales, research and development expenses and other operating expenses, the discount rate, the technological obsolescence rate, and contributory asset charges for developed technology, and the discount rate, revenue growth rates, and prospective financial information for cost of sales and fixed and variable operating expenses for customer relationships; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. As described in the “Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting” section, material weaknesses were identified related to this matter. 
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included, among others (i) evaluating and determining the nature and extent of audit procedures performed and evidence obtained that are responsive to the material weaknesses identified; (ii) reading the purchase agreement; (iii) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimate of the developed technology and customer relationships acquired; (iv) evaluating the appropriateness of the multi-period excess earnings and with-and-without methods used by management; (v) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the multi-period excess earnings and with-and-without methods; and (vi) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to revenue growth rates, prospective financial information for cost of sales, research and development expenses and other operating expenses, the discount rate, the technological obsolescence rate, and contributory asset charges for developed technology, and the discount rate, revenue growth rates, and prospective financial information for cost of sales and fixed and variable operating expenses for customer relationships. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to revenue growth rates, prospective financial information for cost of sales, fixed and variable operating expenses, research and development expenses and other operating expenses involved considering (i) the current and past performance of the Amelia business; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the multi-period excess earnings and with-and-without methods; and (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of the discount rate, the technological obsolescence rate, and contributory asset charges assumptions for developed technology and the discount rate assumption for customer relationships.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1. 
ORGANIZATION
Nature of Operations
SoundHound AI, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” “SoundHound” or the “Company”) turns sound into understanding and actionable meaning. SoundHound’s technology applications enable humans to interact with the things around them in the same way they interact with each other: by speaking naturally to mobile phones, cars, televisions, music speakers, coffee machines, and every other part of the emerging “connected” world. SoundHound's voice AI platform enables product creators to develop their own voice interfaces with their customers. The SoundHound Chat AI voice assistant allows businesses and brands to provide a next-generation voice experience for their users, seamlessly integrating Generative AI and a mix of real-time information domains. Houndify is an open-access platform that allows developers to leverage SoundHound's Voice AI technology. The Company has developed a range of proprietary technologies on our voice AI platform, including Speech-to-Meaning, Deep Meaning Understanding, Collective AI, Dynamic Interaction and SoundHound Chat AI. The SoundHound music app allows customers to identify and play songs by singing or humming into the smartphone’s microphone, or by identifying the sound playing in the background from external sources. SoundHound also provides edge, cloud and hybrid (Edge+Cloud) connectivity solutions that allow brands to optimize their voice-enabled products and devices with options ranging from fully-embedded to exclusively cloud-connected.
On April 26, 2022 (the “Closing Date”), pursuant to a merger agreement dated as of November 15, 2021 by and among Archimedes Tech SPAC Partners Co. (“ATSP”), ATSPC Merger Sub, Inc. and SoundHound, Inc. (“Legacy SoundHound”), the parties consummated the merger of ATSPC Merger Sub, Inc. with and into Legacy SoundHound, with Legacy SoundHound continuing as the surviving corporation (the “Merger”), as well as the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the Merger and such other transactions, the “Business Combination”). In connection with the closing (the “Closing”) of the Business Combination, Legacy SoundHound became a wholly owned subsidiary of ATSP and ATSP changed its name to SoundHound AI, Inc., and all of Legacy SoundHound common stock (“Legacy SoundHound Common Stock”) and Legacy SoundHound redeemable convertible preferred stock (“Legacy SoundHound Preferred Stock”) automatically converted into shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, par value of $
0.0001
 per share (the “Class A Common Stock”), and the Company’s Class B common stock, par value of $
0.0001
 per share (the “Class B Common Stock”, and collectively with the Class A Common Stock, the “Common Stock”). The Company’s Class A Common Stock and certain of the Company's warrants commenced trading on the Nasdaq Global Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbols “SOUN” and “SOUNW,” respectively, on April 28, 2022. Refer to Note 3 for more information on the Business Combination. 
Legacy SoundHound was determined to be the accounting acquirer in the Business Combination based on the following facts:
• Former Legacy SoundHound stockholders have a controlling voting interest in the Company;
• The Company’s board of directors immediately after the closing of the Business Combination was comprised of five board members, primarily from the board of directors of Legacy SoundHound; and
• Legacy SoundHound’s management continues to hold executive management roles for the Company following the Business Combination and are responsible for the day-to-day operations.
Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Business Combination was treated as the equivalent of Legacy SoundHound issuing stock for the net assets of ATSP, accompanied by a reverse recapitalization. The primary asset acquired from ATSP was related to the cash amounts that were assumed. Separately, the Company also assumed warrants that were deemed to be equity upon Closing of the Business Combination. 
No
 goodwill or other intangible assets were recorded as a result of the Business Combination.
While ATSP was the legal acquirer in the Business Combination, because Legacy SoundHound was deemed the accounting acquirer, the historical financial statements of Legacy SoundHound became the historical financial statements of the combined company upon the consummation of the Business Combination. As a result, the financial 
77

SOUNDHOUND AI, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
statements included in this report reflect (i) the historical operating results of Legacy SoundHound prior to the Business Combination; (ii) the combined results of the Company and Legacy SoundHound following the Closing of the Business Combination; (iii) the assets and liabilities of Legacy SoundHound at their historical cost; and (iv) the Company’s equity structure for all periods presented.
In accordance with guidance applicable to recapitalization transactions, the equity structure has been retroactively restated in all comparative periods up to the Closing Date, to reflect the number of shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock issued to Legacy SoundHound Common Stockholders and Legacy SoundHound Preferred Stockholders in connection with the Business Combination. As such, the shares and corresponding capital amounts and loss per share related to Legacy SoundHound Preferred Stock and Legacy SoundHound Common Stock prior to the Business Combination have been retroactively restated as shares reflecting the conversion ratio established in the Business Combination.
On January 3, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Synq3, Inc. ("SYNQ3") in a cash and stock transaction. On June 14, 2024, the Company completed an immaterial acquisition in a cash transaction. On August 6, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Amelia Holdings, Inc. ("Amelia") in a cash and stock transaction. Refer to Note 3 for additional information. 
Going Concern
Since inception, the Company has generated recurring losses as well as negative operating cash flows and reported a net loss of $
350.7
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $
943.1
 million. Management expects to continue to incur additional substantial losses in the foreseeable future. The Company has historically funded its operations primarily through equity or debt financings.
Total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents on hand as of December 31, 2024 was $
198.2
 million. Although the Company has incurred recurring losses each year since its inception, the Company expects it will be able to fund its operations for at least the next twelve months from the date these consolidated financial statements are issued. The Company may seek funding through additional debt or equity financing arrangements, implement incremental expense reduction measures or a combination thereof to continue financing its operations. Refer to Note 23 for information regarding the Company's equity financing activity subsequent to December 31, 2024. The Company's consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.

The Company’s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
We consolidate any variable interest entity (“VIE”) where we have determined we are the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the entity which has both: (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance; and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.

Foreign Currency
The functional currency of the Company and its subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency denominated transactions are converted into U.S. dollars at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the period. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates at the balance sheet date for monetary assets and liabilities and at historical exchange rates for non-monetary assets and liabilities.
 During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized net losses related to foreign currency transactions and remeasurements of $
0.7
 million, $
0.5
 million and $
0.7
 million, respectively, in the consolidated statements of operations as other expense, net. 
Reclassification
Certain accounts in the prior year consolidated financial statements were reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. The reclassification had an immaterial impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss and consolidated statements of cash flows in the prior year period.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Such estimates include revenue recognition, allowance for credit losses, accrued liabilities, derivative and warrant liabilities, calculation of the incremental borrowing rate, financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the accounting for business combinations and allocating purchase price, valuation and estimating the useful life of identifiable intangible assets, probability of achievement of revenue estimates related to contingent earnout consideration and performance-based equity awards, valuation of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions and the fair value of common stock and other assumptions used to measure stock-based compensation expense. In connection with the measurement period for the acquisition of SYNQ3 and Amelia, management revised certain significant estimates during the years ended December 31, 2024, which include, but are not limited to, the recognition and measurement of assumed contingent liabilities and deferred and contingent holdback consideration. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience, the current economic environment, and on assumptions it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The Company adjusts such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Changes in those estimates resulting from changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
Accounts Receivable, Net
Accounts receivable consist of current trade receivables due from customers recorded at invoiced amounts, net of allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts receivable do not bear interest and the Company generally does not require collateral or other security in support of accounts receivable.
When the Company records customer receivables and contract assets arising from revenue transactions, an allowance is recorded for credit losses for the current expected credit losses ("CECL") inherent in the asset over its expected life. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account deducted from the amortized cost basis of the assets to present their net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected. Each period, the allowance for credit losses is adjusted through earnings to reflect expected credit losses over the remaining lives of the assets. 
The Company estimates expected credit losses based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, payment terms, environmental and industry factors, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. When measuring expected credit losses, we pool assets with similar country risk and credit risk characteristics. Changes in the relevant information may materially affect the estimates of expected credit losses.

Property and Equipment, Net
Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets.
The estimated useful lives of the Company’s property and equipment are as follows:
Computer equipment
3
 – 
4
 years
Software
3
 years
Furniture and fixtures
5
 years
Leasehold improvements
Lesser of useful life or the term of the lease
Maintenance and repairs that do not extend the life or improve the asset are expensed as incurred.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company evaluates property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a specific asset or asset group may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the total of estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount. Impairment, if any, would be assessed using discounted cash flows or other appropriate measures of fair value. Through December 31, 2024, there have been 
no
 such impairments.
Leases
We determine if an arrangement is a lease at its inception. Operating lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. We generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of future payments, because the implicit rate of the lease is generally not known. Right-of-use ("ROU") assets related to our operating lease liabilities are measured at lease inception based on the initial measurement of the lease liability, plus any prepaid lease payments and less any lease incentives, as applicable. Our lease terms that are used in determining our operating lease liabilities at lease inception may include options to extend or terminate the leases when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options. We amortize our ROU assets as operating lease expense generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term and classify both the lease amortization and imputed interest as operating expenses. The Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components. The Company elected to not separate lease and non-lease components for its asset class of equipment.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The Company’s cash equivalents consist of treasury bills and money market funds. The treasury bills are treated as available-for-sale securities. Cash equivalents are measured and reported at fair value using quoted prices in active markets for similar securities. The deposits exceed federally insured limits. Changes in fair value for cash equivalents classified as available for sale securities are recorded to other comprehensive loss. 
As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, available-for-sale securities consisted of U.S. treasury bills and government bonds with original maturities of three months or less. As of December 31, 2022, the Company did not have any available-for-sale securities.
Restricted Cash
The Company’s restricted cash were established according to the requirements under the Credit Agreement (as defined in Note 9) and leases for the Company’s corporate headquarters, data center and sales office and are subject to certain 
80
Table of Contents

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
restrictions. Restricted cash is classified as current or non-current on the consolidated balance sheets based on the expected duration of the restriction. Non-current restricted cash relates to interest that is required to be held in escrow in an amount equal to the minimum required balance defined in the Credit Agreement.
Concentrations of Credit Risk and Other Risks and Uncertainties
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, the balances of which frequently exceed federally insured limits. The Company regularly monitors its credit risk exposure and takes steps to mitigate the likelihood of these exposures resulting in actual loss.
As of December 31, 2024, accounts receivable balances due from Customer F accounted for 
23
% of the Company’s consolidated accounts receivable balance. As of December 31, 2023, accounts receivable balances due from Customer A, C and E accounted for 
40
%, 
32
% and 
15
% of the Company’s consolidated accounts receivable balance, respectively.
As of December 31, 2024, unbilled receivables from Customer A and C accounted for 
50
% and 
24
% of the Company’s consolidated unbilled receivables balance, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, unbilled receivables from Customer A, B, and C accounted for 
59
%, 
16
% and 
11
% of the Company’s consolidated unbilled receivables balance, respectively.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, Customer A accounted for 
14
% of revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2023, Customer A and B accounted for 
49
% and 
13
% of revenue, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2022, Customer A, C and D accounted for 
42
%, 
13
%, and 
12
% of revenue, respectively. 
Common Stock Offerings
The Company has entered into certain agreements to sell common stock with counterparties including through the Equity Line of Credit ("ELOC") program and “at-the-market” offering programs pursuant to the Sales Agreement, Equity Distribution Agreement and Execute Equity Distribution Agreements (each as described in Note 14) to further support its growth strategy through initiatives such as accretive acquisitions and internal investments, to bolster working capital, and/or for general corporate purposes. The Company evaluates its common stock purchase agreements to determine whether they should be accounted for as derivatives with changes in fair value as other income (expense), net in the period in which they occur.

Equity Issuance Costs
The Company capitalizes certain legal, professional, accounting and other third-party fees that are directly associated with in-process equity-classified financings as deferred offering costs until such financings are consummated. After consummation of the financing, these costs are recorded as a reduction of the proceeds received from the equity financing. If a planned equity financing is abandoned, the deferred offering costs are expensed immediately as a charge to operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 (“ASC 606”), 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
, when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following five steps:
(i)
Identification of the contract(s) with a customer;
(ii)
Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;
81
Table of Contents
SOUNDHOUND AI, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
(iii)
Determination of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration;
(iv)
Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
(v)
Recognition of revenue when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied.
Contracts are accounted for when both parties have approved and committed to the contract, the rights of the parties and payment terms are identifiable, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable.
Under ASC 606, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met, the Company recognizes revenue for arrangements upon the transfer of control of the Company’s performance obligations to its customers. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer and is the unit of account in ASC 606. Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those services.
The Company elected the practical expedient to recognize the incremental costs of obtaining a contract including sales commissions as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of such incremental cost would otherwise have been one year or less. Sales commissions are included in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
Research and Development
The Company’s research and development costs are expensed as incurred. These costs include salaries and other personnel related expenses, contractor fees, facility costs, supplies, and depreciation of equipment associated with the design and development of new products prior to the establishment of their technological feasibility.
Warrants
The Company determines whether to classify contracts, such as warrants, that may be settled in its own stock as equity of the entity or as a liability. An equity-linked financial instrument must be considered indexed to the Company’s own stock to qualify for equity classification. The Company classifies warrants as liabilities for any contracts that may require a transfer of assets. Warrants classified as liabilities are accounted for at fair value and remeasured at each reporting date until exercise, expiration or modification that results in equity classification. Any change in the fair value of the warrants is recognized as other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. A valuation allowance is established when, in management’s estimate, it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company adopted a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company records a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on the Company’s tax return.
The Company classifies interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense, if applicable. The Company has recorded $
0.2
 million interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits through December 31, 2024.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company measures and records the expense related to stock-based payment awards based on the fair value of those awards as determined on the date of grant. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense over the

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
requisite service period of the individual grant, generally equal to the vesting period, and uses the straight-line method to recognize stock-based compensation, except for restricted stock unit awards (“RSUs”) with vesting conditions tied to certain performance criteria ("Performance-Based RSUs"). Stock-based compensation costs for Performance-Based RSUs are recognized on a graded-vesting basis over the vesting period based on the most probable outcome of the performance conditions. If the minimum performance targets are not met, no compensation cost is recognized and any recognized compensation cost is reversed, except for awards subject to a market condition, The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan ("ESPP") shares. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions to determine the fair value of the awards, including the expected term of the award and the price volatility of the underlying stock. The Company calculates the fair value of the awards granted by using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:
Expected Volatility
 — The Company estimates volatility for the awards by evaluating the average historical volatility of a peer group of companies for the period immediately preceding the award grant for a term that is approximately equal to the awards’ expected term.
Expected Term
 — The expected term of the Company’s awards represents the period that the stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. The Company has elected to use the midpoint between the stock options’ vesting term and contractual expiration period to compute the expected term, as the Company does not have sufficient historical information to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns and post-vesting employment termination behavior. For the valuation of ESPP shares, the Company uses the period of time from the valuation date to the purchase date.   
Risk-Free Interest Rate
 — The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a term that is equal to the awards’ expected term at the grant date.
Expected Dividend Yield
 — The Company has not declared or paid dividends to date and does not anticipate declaring dividends. As such, expected dividend yield is 
zero
.
Restricted Stock Units
The Company issues RSUs to grantees as compensation for services. The fair value of the RSUs is determined at the grant date based on the fair value of the Company’s Class A Common Stock and for RSUs with service conditions only, is recognized straight-line over the service period.
Stock-based compensation related to Performance-Based RSUs is recognized to the extent it is determined that performance is probable of being achieved.
The Company issues RSUs with vesting conditions tied to certain market conditions (“Market-Based RSUs”). To derive the fair value of Market-Based RSUs, the Company applies a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the grant date fair value. Stock-based compensation related to Market-Based RSUs is recognized over the derived service period.
Fair Value Measurements
The Company defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received from an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company follows a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements as follows:
•
Level 1 — 
Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.
•
Level 2 — 
Inputs (other than quoted market prices included in Level 1) are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instrument’s anticipated life.
83
Table of Contents
SOUNDHOUND AI, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
•
Level 3 — 
Inputs reflect management’s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model.
Preferred Stock
The Company assesses its preferred stock instruments at issuance and each reporting period for classification and derivative features requiring bifurcation.
The Company presents as temporary equity any stock which (i) the Company undertakes to redeem at a fixed or determinable price on the fixed or determinable date or dates; (ii) is redeemable at the option of the holders, or (iii) has conditions for redemption which are not solely within the control of the Company. For stock presented as temporary equity that is not currently redeemable, the Company assesses the probability of the event that would lead to redemption. If it is probable that the equity instrument will become redeemable, the Company accretes changes in the redemption value over the period from the date of issuance, or from the date that it becomes probable that the instrument will become redeemable, if later, to the earliest redemption date of the instrument using an appropriate methodology. If an equity instrument classified as temporary equity is not probable of redemption, subsequent adjustment of the amounts presented in temporary equity is unnecessary.
Net Loss Per Share
Basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, without consideration for potentially dilutive securities.
Diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common stock and potentially dilutive securities outstanding for the period. For purposes of the diluted net loss per share calculation, Series A Preferred Stock, stock options, ESPP shares, RSUs and warrants are considered to be potentially dilutive securities. See Note 15 for further information.
Accordingly, in periods in which the Company reports a net loss, diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share, since dilutive common stock is not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive.
The Company issued Series A Preferred Stock, which accrues cumulative dividends which are either paid in cash or compounding to the liquidation preference at the discretion of the board of directors. The Company accrues dividends as adjustments to net loss before net loss attributable to common stockholders.
The Company applies the two-class method to calculate its basic and diluted net loss per share as the Company has issued shares that meet the definition of participating securities. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that treats a participating security as having rights to earnings that otherwise would have been available to common stockholders. The Company's participating securities contractually entitle the holders of such shares to participate in dividends, but do not contractually require the holders of such shares to participate in losses of the Company. Accordingly, in periods in which the Company reports a net loss, such losses are not allocated to such participating securities.
Business Combinations and Contingent Consideration
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The Company allocates the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Fair value of the acquired intangible assets was determined using an income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings method, relief-from-royalty method, or the with-and-without method, depending on the nature of the respective assets. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but the estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to 
84
Table of Contents
SOUNDHOUND AI, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
refinement. The significant judgments and assumptions used in valuing the developed technology include revenue growth rates, prospective financial information for cost of sales, research and development expenses and, other operating expenses, the discount rate, the technological obsolescence rate, and contributory asset charges. For customer relationships, the significant judgments and assumptions include revenue growth rates, customer attrition rate, prospective financial information for cost of sales and fixed and variable operating expenses and the discount rate. These estimates are inherently uncertain and, therefore, actual results may differ from the estimates made. As a result, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may make adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the measurement period's conclusion or final determination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations in the period they are identified. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred.
Certain business combinations include contingent consideration arrangements, which are generally based on achievement of future financial performance or future events. If it is determined the contingent consideration arrangement is not compensatory, the Company estimates fair value of contingent consideration payments as part of the initial purchase price and records the estimated fair value of contingent consideration as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet. The Company reviews and assesses the estimated fair value of contingent consideration each reporting period, and the updated fair value could differ materially from the initial estimates. Adjustments to estimated fair value related to changes in fair value are reported as change in fair value of contingent acquisition liabilities in our consolidated statements of operations.

Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but tested annually for impairment or when indicators of impairment are present. The test for goodwill impairment involves a qualitative assessment of impairment indicators. If indicators are present, a quantitative test of impairment is performed. Goodwill impairment, if any, is determined by comparing the reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying value. An impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying value over its fair value, up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The Company's policy is to review goodwill for impairment annually on October 1st unless a triggering event requires an analysis sooner.
 There was 
no
 goodwill impairment in any of the periods presented.
Intangible Assets with Definite Lives
The Company's intangible assets consist principally of developed technology, customer relationships, tradename, and conversation data. The Company assesses the appropriate method of amortization of the intangible assets that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed. The Company determined that a straight-line method of amortization was appropriate for its intangible assets. The remaining useful lives of long-lived assets are re-assessed periodically at the asset group level for any events and circumstances that may change the future cash flows expected to be generated from the long-lived asset or asset group. 
Intangible assets with definite lives are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a specific asset or asset group may not be recoverable. We assess the recoverability of intangible assets with definite lives at the asset group level. Asset groups are determined based upon the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For the purpose of the recoverability test, we compare the total undiscounted future cash flows from the use and disposition of the assets with its net carrying amount. When the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows, the asset group is deemed to be impaired. The amount of the impairment loss represents the excess of the asset or asset group’s carrying value over its estimated fair value, which is generally determined based upon the present value of estimated future pre-tax cash flows that a market participant would expect from use and disposition of the long-lived asset or asset group.
 There were 
no
 intangible asset impairments in any of the periods presented.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements — Adopted
The Company continually assess any ASUs or other new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB to determine their applicability and impact. Where it is determined that a new accounting pronouncement will result in a change to the Company's financial reporting, the Company takes the appropriate steps to ensure that such changes are properly reflected in the consolidated financial statements or notes thereto.
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, "Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures," ("ASU 2023-07") which expands disclosures about a public business entity's reportable segments and provides for more detailed information about a reportable segment's expenses. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and requires retrospective application to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted the standard during the year ended December 31, 2024. See Note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included within this report for more information on the increased disclosure for the Company's single reportable segment.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements — Not Yet Adopted
In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-09, which requires more detailed income tax disclosures. The guidance requires entities to disclose disaggregated information about their effective tax rate reconciliation as well as expanded information on income taxes paid by jurisdiction. The disclosure requirements will be applied on a prospective basis, with the option to apply them retrospectively. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. 
The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the updated standard will have on the financial statement disclosures.
NOTE 3. 
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
As discussed in Note 1, on April 26, 2022, the Business Combination was consummated. Pursuant to the Company’s Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “certificate of incorporation”), the Company is authorized to issue 
500,000,000
 shares of capital stock consisting of 
455,000,000
 shares of Class A Common Stock, 
44,000,000
 shares of Class B Common Stock, and 
1,000,000
 shares of preferred stock. All stock has a par value of $
0.0001
 per share. The holders of Class A Common Stock are entitled to 
one
 vote for each share of Class A Common Stock held and the holders of Class B Common Stock are entitled to 
ten
 votes per share on all matters submitted to stockholders for their vote or approval. The holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock vote together as one class, other than on certain specific matters described in the Company's certificate of incorporation.
The Business Combination was approved by ATSP’s stockholders at a special meeting thereof (the “Special Meeting”), held in lieu of the 2022 annual meeting of the Company’s stockholders. The Business Combination fulfilled the definition of an “initial business combination” as required by the ATSP’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. This fulfillment resulted in ATSP ceasing to be a shell company upon the Closing.
An aggregate of 
12,767,950
 shares of Class A Common Stock sold in ATSP’s initial public offering (the “public shares”) exercised their rights to redemption. The redemption right provided holders the right to have their public shares redeemed for a pro rata portion of the trust account holding the proceeds from ATSP’s initial public offering. The value of the shares is calculated as of two (2) business days prior to the date of the Special Meeting, which was $
10.00
 per share, or $
127.7
 million in the aggregate.
As a result of the Business Combination, among other things (1) all outstanding shares of Legacy SoundHound Common Stock as of immediately prior to the Closing (including Legacy SoundHound Common Stock resulting from the Legacy SoundHound Preferred Stock Conversion), were exchanged at an conversion ratio of 
5.5562
 (the “Conversion Ratio”) for an aggregate of 
140,114,060
 shares of Class A Common Stock and 
40,396,600
 Class B Common Stock; (2) each outstanding warrant to purchase shares of Legacy SoundHound Common Stock automatically converted into a warrant to purchase, subject to substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable under these warrants prior to the Effective Time, shares of Class A Common Stock, proportionately adjusted for the Conversion Ratio, with the per share exercise price equal to the exercise price prior to the Effective

Time divided by the Conversion Ratio and were net exercised upon the Closing; (3) each outstanding option to purchase shares of Legacy SoundHound Common Stock converted into an option to purchase, subject to substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable under these options prior to the Effective Time, shares of Class A Common Stock equal to the number of shares subject to such option prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Conversion Ratio, with the per share exercise price equal to the exercise price prior to the Effective Time divided by the Conversion Ratio; (4) each Legacy SoundHound RSU converted into a restricted stock unit of SoundHound, subject to substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the SoundHound RSU prior to the Closing. SoundHound RSU holders received the same consideration holders would have received if the SoundHound RSU was converted into Legacy SoundHound Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time.
In connection with the Merger Agreement, ATSP entered into subscription agreements (collectively, the “Subscription Agreements”) with certain accredited investors (the “Subscribers”). Pursuant to the Subscription Agreements, the Subscribers agreed to purchase, and ATSP agreed to sell to the Subscribers, an aggregate of 
11,300,000
 shares of Class A Common Stock (“PIPE Shares”), for a purchase price of $
10.00
 per share and an aggregate purchase price of $
113.0
 million (the “PIPE Investment”). The PIPE shares are identical to the shares of Class A Common Stock that were held by the ATSP’s public stockholders at the time of the Closing, except that the PIPE Shares were not entitled to any redemption rights. The sale of PIPE Shares was consummated concurrently with the Closing.
The Business Combination is accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Under this method of accounting, ATSP was treated as the “acquired” company for financial reporting purposes. The net assets of Legacy SoundHound were stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded.
In accounting for the Business Combination and after redemptions, net proceeds received by the Company totaled $
90.7
 million. 
The table below shows the total net proceeds from the Business Combination and the PIPE Investment (in thousands):

4.1
 million of Legacy SoundHound transaction costs specific and directly attributable to the Business Combination were initially capitalized as deferred offering costs and included in other non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Total transaction expenses were recorded as an offset against proceeds received on the closing of the Business Combination, accounted for as additional paid-in capital.
The amount recorded to additional paid-in-capital was comprised of $
86.6
 million net proceeds from the PIPE investment and $
4.1
 million after net redemptions of ATSP shareholders.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
SYNQ3 Acquisition
On January 3, 2024 (the "SYNQ3 Acquisition Date"), the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity of SYNQ3, a provider of voice AI and other technology solutions to the restaurant industry, for total purchase consideration of $
15.8
 million (the “SYNQ3 Acquisition”). The Company’s acquisition of SYNQ3 is expected to expand its AI customer service solutions and create a Voice AI provider for restaurants. The acquisition is expected to significantly extend the Company's market reach and accelerate the deployment of generative AI capabilities to the industry.
The total purchase consideration includes $
3.9
 million in cash paid and 
5,755,910
 in shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock. The Company has also withheld purchase consideration of $
0.5
 million in cash and 
1,179,514
 shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock, subject to customary net working capital adjustments, to partially secure the indemnification obligations of SYNQ3's former stockholders under the merger agreement and agreed to pay up to $
0.8
 million in cash and 
1,434,936
 in shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock to certain former stockholders of SYNQ3 based upon the achievement of specified future milestones. On the SYNQ3 Acquisition Date, the Company also issued 
2,033,156
 restricted shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock subject to time and performance-based vesting conditions. The fair value of the purchase consideration was $
15.8
 million.
Holdback
The $
0.5
 million in cash and 
1,179,514
 shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock is being withheld for a period of 
15
 months (the "Holdback Amount"). The Company determined that there are two components to the Holdback Amount related to deferred consideration and contingent consideration, each comprised of cash and shares. 
The deferred cash holdback consideration of $
0.1
 million and the deferred share holdback consideration of 
361,145
 shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock (collectively the "Deferred Consideration") were not recognized as of the SYNQ3 Acquisition Date as such amounts were offset by the indemnification obligations of SYNQ3's former stockholders.
The contingent cash and share holdback consideration to be issued is variable ("Contingent Holdback Consideration"). Final amounts to be issued will be reduced based upon future actions and settlements with third parties to resolve assumed contingent sales tax liabilities and certain other assumed contingent liabilities of SYNQ3 in connection with the SYNQ3 Acquisition. The Company accounted for the Contingent Holdback Consideration as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet. As of the SYNQ3 Acquisition Date, the Contingent Holdback Consideration was estimated to be $
0.6
 million in aggregate and to be settled in $
0.1
 million cash and the remainder in shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company issued 
38,277
 shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock and paid an immaterial amount in cash from the Contingent Holdback Consideration to SYNQ3's former stockholders as a result of the net working capital adjustments settled during the year. The Contingent Holdback Consideration will be subsequently remeasured at each reporting date with changes in fair value recognized as a component of operating expense on the Company’s consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included within this report for more information on the fair value measurement of shares associated with the holdback.
Contingent SYNQ3 Earnout Consideration
The Company also agreed to pay in aggregate up to $
0.8
 million in cash and 
1,434,936
 in shares of Class A Common Stock to certain stockholders of SYNQ3 based on tiered annual revenue targets for each fiscal year 2024, 2025 and 2026 (the “Contingent SYNQ3 Earnout Consideration”). The Company accounted for the Contingent SYNQ3 Earnout Consideration as a liability within contingent acquisition liabilities on the Company's consolidated balance sheets and will subsequently remeasure the liability at each reporting date with changes in fair value recognized as a component of operating expense in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. As of the SYNQ3 Acquisition Date, the Contingent SYNQ3 Earnout Consideration was estimated to be $
1.7
 million in aggregate and to be settled in $
0.2
 million cash and the remainder in shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included within this report for more information on the fair value measurement of Contingent SYNQ3 Earnout Consideration. As of December 31, 2024, the 2024 revenue target was

Restricted stock awards
The 
2,033,156
 restricted shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock issued at the SYNQ3 Acquisition Date to certain continuing employees of SYNQ3 subject to time and performance-based vesting conditions was determined to be a separate transaction from the SYNQ3 Acquisition and therefore is excluded from purchase consideration. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included within this report for more information on stock-based awards issued in connection with the SYNQ3 Acquisition.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded measurement period adjustments to decrease the deferred revenue by $
0.1
 million as the revenue recognition criteria had been met at the acquisition date, to increase

the accrued liabilities by $
1.8
 million resulting from a pre-acquisition legal settlement, and to decrease the deferred tax liability assumed by $

0.6
 million in deferred equity consideration, and $
0.4
 million in contingent holdback consideration in accordance with the merger agreement. As a result of the adjusted acquisition-date fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the Company recorded an increase of $

 million to the goodwill recognized. The measurement period adjustments were recorded in the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024 and were made to reflect facts and circumstances that existed as of the SYNQ3 Acquisition Date. The purchase price allocation has been finalized as of December 31, 2024.

Amelia Acquisition
On August 6, 2024 (the “Amelia Acquisition Date”), the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity of Amelia Holdings, Inc. (the “Amelia Acquisition”), a privately-held conversational AI software company involved in the development and delivery of AI and automation solutions and related services to improve customer experience and optimize business outcomes. The Company’s acquisition of Amelia is expected to strengthen SoundHound’s position in voice and conversational AI and allow the Company to enter new industries such as healthcare, insurance, financial services, energy and retail, expanding its market reach.
The total preliminary purchase consideration includes 
3,809,520
 shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock issued to the selling shareholders. The Company also issued and deposited 
2,149,530
 shares of Class A Common Stock otherwise owed to the selling shareholders into an escrow account in order to partially secure the indemnification obligations of the selling shareholders to the Company under the purchase agreement (the “Escrow Consideration”). The fair value of equity issued as part of the consideration paid was determined on the basis of the closing market price of the Company’s shares on the Amelia Acquisition Date, which also incorporated a discount for lack of marketability rates caused by the trading restrictions due to the fact that the shares were not registered at issuance for a 
six-month
 holding period. The Company also paid $
8.4
 million of cash for seller transaction expenses in connection with the closing of the Amelia Acquisition. The Company agreed to issue up to 
16,822,429
 shares to the

selling shareholders based on achievement of certain revenue targets in fiscal years 2025 and 2026 (the "Amelia Contingent Earnout Consideration). The fair value of the preliminary purchase consideration was $
98.6
 million.
In connection with the Amelia Acquisition, the Company assumed the amended senior secured term loan facility from Amelia in an aggregate principal amount of $
121.5
 million (“Amelia Debt”). See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included within this report for more information on the Amelia Debt.
Escrow Consideration
The Company accounted for the Escrow Consideration as equity-classified shares issued as part of the consideration transferred. The Company recorded an indemnification asset of $
1.4
 million under other non-current assets related to assumed sales tax and litigation contingent liabilities that existed prior to the Amelia Acquisition Date and are covered by the Company’s indemnification rights provided by the sellers. Upon the settlement of any valid indemnification claims against the selling shareholders, the escrow agent will return a number of shares to the Company equal to the dollar value of the indemnified loss divided by the reference price of $
5.35
 as stipulated in the purchase agreement. The Company concluded that this variability in settlement value is a derivative that is required to be remeasured to fair value due to changes in stock price. This derivative did not have a material impact to the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024. Upon the expiration of the escrow period, any remaining shares within the escrow account will be released to the selling shareholders.
Contingent Amelia Earnout Consideration
The Company also agreed to pay up to 
16,822,429
 in shares of Class A Common Stock to the selling shareholders based on achievement of certain annual revenue targets in fiscal years 2025 and 2026. The Company accounted for the Contingent Amelia Earnout Consideration as a liability within contingent acquisition liabilities on the Company's consolidated balance sheets and will subsequently remeasure the liability at each reporting date with changes in fair value recognized as a component of operating expense in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. As of the Amelia Acquisition Date, the Contingent Amelia Earnout Consideration had an estimated fair value of $
66.3
 million. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized a $
211.9
 million loss related to the Contingent Amelia Earnout Consideration, reflected in the change in fair value of contingent acquisition liabilities in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included within this report for more information on the fair value measurement of Contingent Amelia Earnout Consideration. As of December 31, 2024, the Company assessed the 2025 and 2026 revenue target were probable of being met.

0.2
 million, increase the accrued liabilities by $
0.9
 million due to additional payroll taxes identified, to decrease the non-current income tax liabilities by $

 million due to the change of pre-acquisition tax exposures subsequent to the acquisition. As a result of the adjusted acquisition-date fair value of cash consideration, assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the Company recorded a decrease of $
0.7
 million to the goodwill recognized. The measurement period adjustments were recorded in the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024 and were made to reflect facts and circumstances that existed as of the Amelia Acquisition Date. In addition to the measurement period adjustments, the Company also recorded adjustments to correct certain errors in the preliminary purchase price allocation that existed as of the acquisition date during the year ended December 31, 2024, which decreased the contingent earnout consideration by $
5.3
 million, decreased the accounts payable by $
3.7
 million, decreased the accrued liabilities by $

The identified error related to the contingent earnout consideration had an immaterial impact to the change in fair value from the acquisition date through September 30, 2024, which would have been recorded in change in fair value of contingent acquisition liabilities in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
The preliminary purchase price allocation has not been finalized as of December 31, 2024 primarily due to the final assessment of the fair values of the intangible assets, contingent tax liability assumed, and fair value of the contingent earnout consideration. The fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is pending the completion of various items, including obtaining further information regarding the identification and valuation of all assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Any adjustments to the estimates of purchase price allocation will be made in the periods in which the adjustments are determined, and the cumulative effect of such adjustments will be calculated as if the adjustments had been completed as of the acquisition date. The Company expects to finalize the purchase price allocation within 12 months from the Amelia Acquisition Date.

The unaudited pro forma financial information includes the combined historical operating results of the Company, SYNQ3 and Amelia prior to the acquisitions, with adjustments to give effect for the acquisitions and related events. Pro forma adjustments have been made to reflect the incremental intangible asset amortization to be incurred based on the fair values and useful lives of each identifiable intangible asset, incremental stock-based compensation related to inducement equity awards, incremental transaction costs related to the acquisitions, adjustments to interest expense related to previously outstanding debt held by the acquired entities, elimination of amortization expense related to previously recognized goodwill held by SYNQ3, and the related tax effects of pro forma adjustments for the period. Given the paydown of Amelia Debt occurred in December 2024, which was shortly after the Amelia Acquisition Date, the interest expenses from Amelia Debt were excluded from the unaudited pro forma financial information. These unaudited pro forma results are presented for informational purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of what the actual results of operations of the combined company would have been if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the period presented, nor are they indicative of future results of operations. The unaudited pro forma results are based on the preliminary purchase price allocation and will be updated to reflect the final amounts as the allocation is finalized during the measurement period.
The Company did not have any material nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings.
Other Acquisition
On June 14, 2024, the Company completed an immaterial acquisition for total preliminary purchase consideration of $
1.0
 million. As part of the acquisition, the Company acquired net assets of $
2.2
 million, including intangible assets of $
2.6
 million, and recognized a preliminary gain on bargain purchase of $
1.2
 million within 
other income (expense)
, net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss during the year ended December 31, 2024, resulting from a favorable fair value of identifiable net assets acquired at the date of acquisition as compared with the Company’s purchase price. The Company was able to negotiate a bargain purchase price as a result of the recurring losses and pre-filing bankruptcy status of the selling entity.
The preliminary purchase price allocation has not been finalized as of December 31, 2024 primarily due to the final assessment of the fair values of the intangible assets. The fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is pending the completion of various items, including obtaining further information regarding the identification and valuation of all assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Any adjustments to the estimates of purchase price allocation will be made in the periods in which the adjustments are determined, and the cumulative effect of such adjustments will be calculated as if the adjustments had been completed as of the acquisition date.

NOTE 4. 
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Revenues are generally recognized upon the transfer of control of promised products or services provided to customers, reflecting the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive for those products or services.
The Company’s arrangements with customers may contain multiple obligations. Individual services are accounted for separately if they are distinct — that is, if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer and if the service is separately identifiable from other items in the contract.
The Company derives its revenue primarily from the following performance obligations: (1) hosted services, (2) professional services, (3) monetization, and (4) licensing. Revenues are reported net of applicable sales and use taxes that are passed through to customers. The Company applies significant judgement in identifying and evaluating any terms and conditions in contracts which impact revenue recognition.
The Company has the following performance obligations in contracts with customers:
Hosted Services
Hosted services, along with non-distinct customization, integration, maintenance and support professional services, allow customers to access the Houndify and Amelia Software Platform over the contract period without taking possession of the software.

The Company has determined that the hosted services arrangements are a single performance obligation comprised of a series of distinct services, since each day of providing access to hosted services is substantially the same and the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as access is provided. These services are provided either on a usage basis (i.e., variable consideration) or on a fixed fee subscription basis. The Company recognizes revenue as each distinct service period is performed.
Hosted services may include up-front services to develop and/or customize the applications to each customer’s specification. Judgement is required to determine whether these professional services are distinct from the hosted services. In making this determination, factors such as the degree of integration, the customers’ ability to start using the software prior to customization, and the availability of these services from other independent vendors are considered.
95
Table of Contents
SOUNDHOUND AI, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
In instances where the Company concluded that the up-front services are not distinct performance obligations, revenues for these activities are recognized over the period which the hosted services are provided and is included within hosted services revenue.
All revenues derived as a result of the SYNQ3 Acquisition, and substantial revenues derived as a result of the Amelia Acquisition are categorized as hosted service revenue.
Professional Services
Revenues from distinct professional services, such as non-integrated development services and other professional services, are either recognized over time based upon the progress towards completion of the project, or at a point in time at project completion. The Company assesses distinct professional services to determine whether the transfer of control is over-time or at a point in time. The Company considers three criteria in making their assessment including (1) the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits; (2) the Company’s performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced; or (3) the Company’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. If none of the criteria are met, revenues are determined to be recognized at a point in time.
For distinct professional services determined to be recognized over-time, measuring the stage of completion of a project requires significant judgement and estimates and is based on either input or output measures. During the year ended December 31, 2024, $
9.4
 million of professional service revenue was recognized over time, with the remaining $
0.1
 million recognized at a point in time when the performance obligation was fulfilled and control of the service was transferred to the customer. During the year ended December 31, 2023, $
7.4
 million of professional service revenue was recognized over time, with the remaining $
0.9
 million recognized at a point in time when the performance obligation was fulfilled and control of the service was transferred to the customer. During the year ended December 31, 2022, $
2.2
 million of professional service revenue was recognized over time, with the remaining $
2.0
 million recognized at a point in time when the performance obligation was fulfilled and control of the service was transferred to the customer.
Monetization
Monetization revenues are primarily derived from advertising payments associated with ad impressions placed on the SoundHound music identification application. The amount of revenue is based on actual monetization generated or usage, which represent a variable consideration with constrained estimates. Therefore, the Company recognizes the related revenues at a point in time when advertisements are placed, when commissions are paid or when the SoundHound application is downloaded. The determination of whether revenue should be reported on a gross or net basis is based on an assessment of whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent in the transaction. The Company has determined that it does not act as the principal in monetization arrangements because it does not control the transfer of the service and it does not set the price. Based on these factors, the Company reports revenue on a net basis.
Licensing
The Company licenses voice and Amelia's software solutions that are embedded in customer's products or services. Licensing revenues are a distinct performance obligation that is recognized when control is transferred to the customer, which is at a point in time for non-customized solutions. For licenses with non-distinct customized solutions, revenues are recognized over time based on the progress towards completion of the customized solution. Revenues generated from licensing are on royalty arrangements with a per unit pricing or on fixed considerations. The Company records licensing revenue relating to usage-based royalty arrangements in the same period in which the underlying usage occurs. Licensing revenue on fixed considerations including fixed fee and a minimum guarantee from royalty arrangements are recognized when the Company grants the customer the right to use and benefit from the license at the start of the licensing period. Licenses may include post-contract support, which is a distinct performance obligation and revenue from post- contract support is recognized ratably over the licensing period.
96
Table of Contents
SOUNDHOUND AI, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
When a contract has multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative estimated standalone selling price (“SSP”). Judgments are required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. SSP is determined by maximizing observable inputs from pricing of standalone sales, when possible. Since prices vary from customer to customer based on customer relationship, volume discount and contract type, in instances where the SSP is not directly observable, the Company estimates SSP by considering the following factors:
•
Costs of developing and supplying each performance obligation;
•
Industry standards;
•
Major product groupings; and
•
Gross margin objectives and pricing practices, such as contractually stated prices, discounts offered and applicable price lists.
These factors may vary over time, depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. If the facts and circumstances underlying the factors considered change or should future facts and circumstances lead the Company to consider additional factors, the Company’s best estimate of SSP may also change. When such observable data is not available because there is a limited number of transactions or prices are highly variable, the Company will estimate the standalone selling price using the residual approach.
The Company's long-term contracts generally do not have significant financing components, as there is normally payment and performance in each year of the contract. The Company has elected the practical expedient to not adjust promised amounts of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if the Company expects, at contract inception, that the period between when the Company transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less. If there is a period of one year or longer between the transfer of promised services and payment, it is generally for reasons other than financing, thus, the Company does not adjust the transaction price for financing components. In the limited cases where a significant financing component is present, the Company adjusts the promised consideration for the effects of a significant financing component and to recognize revenue to approximate an amount that reflects the cash selling price that a customer would have paid for the promised goods or services.
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, revenue under each performance obligation was as follows (in thousands):

The Company also disaggregates revenue by service type. This disaggregation consists of Product Royalties, Service Subscriptions and Monetization. Product Royalties revenues are derived from Houndified Products, which are voice-enabled tangible products across the automotive and consumer electronics industries. Revenues from Product Royalties are based on volume, usage, or life of the products, which are driven by number of devices, users, or unit of time. Service Subscription revenues are generated through Houndified Services and Amelia services, which include customer services, food ordering, content, appointments and voice commerce, autonomous business workflows, and IT systems analysis. Subscription revenues are derived from monthly fees based on fixed fees, usage-based revenue, revenue per query or revenue per user. Houndified Products, Houndified Services, and Amelia services may include professional services that develop and customize the Houndify platform and Amelia Software Platform to fit customers’ specific needs, and any post-contract support for on-premise solutions. Revenues from Monetization are generated from the SoundHound music identification app and are primarily attributable to user ad impression revenue.

Contract Balances
The Company performs its obligations under a contract with a customer by providing access to software, licensing right to use software, or providing services in exchange for consideration from the customer. The timing of the Company’s performance often differs from the timing of the customer’s payment, which results in the recognition of a receivable, a contract asset or deferred revenue. 
As of January 1, 2023, accounts receivable, net of allowances, was $
3.4
 million, contract assets, net of allowances, were $
8.7
 million and deferred revenue was $
13.4
 million.

Legal Proceedings
From time to time, the Company may have certain contingent liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities. The Company accrues contingent liabilities when it is probable that future expenditures will be made, and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated. Prior to the SYNQ3 Acquisition, SYNQ3 filed a litigation against its landlord, TEBO in the United States District Court of Colorado, and TEBO counterclaimed in May 2022. On June 2, 2022, the District Court entered a judgment that was in favor of SYNQ3. TEBO filed the notice of appeal in July, 2023. On June 27, 2024, the Colorado Court of Appeals reversed the judgment and remanded the case to the District Court to enter judgment in favor of TEBO on both SYNQ3’s claim and TEBO’s counterclaim and to conduct further proceedings as are necessary to determine the damages, attorney fees and costs, if any, to be awarded to TEBO. On January 15, 2025, the Company entered a Settlement Agreement with TEBO. The Settlement Agreement requires SYNQ3 to pay $
1.8
 million to TEBO in January 2025 to resolve all matters related to the litigation and dispute. Therefore, the Company recorded a liability of $
1.8
 million under accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2024.
Other Matters
The Company continues to analyze potential sales tax exposure using a state-by-state assessment. In accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies, the Company estimated and recorded a liability of $
3.1
 million and $
0.2
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
NOTE 9. 
WARRANTS
Term Loan Warrants
In connection with the Credit Agreement (as defined in Note 10), the Company issued warrants to purchase up to 
3,301,536
 shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock to the lenders (the "Term Loan Warrants"). The Term Loan Warrants have a per share exercise price of $
2.59
 and may be exercised, including on a cashless basis, by the holder at any time prior to the 
10-year
 anniversary of the issue date. The Term Loan Warrants will be automatically cashless exercised immediately prior to a change in control of the Company. The Term Loan Warrants are indexed to the Company's stock and were classified as an equity instrument. On the Term Loan Closing Date, this resulted in the Company allocating the gross proceeds and issuance costs between the Term Loan and the Term Loan Warrants based on their relative fair values, resulting in the initial recognition of the Term Loan Warrant at $
4.1
 million as additional paid-in-capital on the consolidated balance sheets. 
In March 2024, the Company issued 
2,269,982
 shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock resulting from the cashless exercise in full of the Term Loan Warrants that were outstanding. As of December 31, 2024, all of the Term Loan Warrants had been exercised and 
no
 Term Loan Warrants are outstanding.
Warrants Related to the Business Combination
Public Warrants
On April 26, 2022 (the "Closing"), pursuant to a merger agreement dated as of November 15, 2021 by and among Archimedes Tech SPAC Partners Co. (“ATSP”), ATSPC Merger Sub, Inc. and SoundHound, Inc. (“Legacy SoundHound”), the parties consummated the merger of ATSPC Merger Sub, Inc. with and into Legacy SoundHound, with Legacy SoundHound continuing as the surviving corporation, as well as the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the merger and such other transactions collectively referred to the “ATSP Merger”). 
Prior to the ATSP Merger, ATSP issued public warrants (“Public Warrants”). Each Public Warrant entitles the holder to the right to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $
11.50
 per share. No fractional shares were issued upon exercise of the Public Warrants. The Company may redeem the outstanding warrants, for $
0.01
 per warrant, upon not less than 
30
 days’ prior written notice of redemption, if the reported last sale price of the common stock equals or exceeds $
18.00
 per share (as adjusted for stock dividends, sub-divisions, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 
20
 trading days within a 
30
-trading day period commencing after the warrants become exercisable and ending on the third trading day before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the 
102
Table of Contents
SOUNDHOUND AI, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
warrant holders. Upon issuance of a redemption notice by the Company, the warrant holders may, at any time after the redemption notice, exercise the Public Warrants for cash, or on a cashless basis.
Subsequent to the closing of the ATSP Merger, the Company’s Public Warrants continue to be classified as equity instruments, as they are indexed to the Company’s stock.
Private Warrants
Prior to the ATSP Merger, ATSP issued private warrants (“Private Warrants”). The Private Warrants were initially issued in the same form as the Public Warrants with the exception that the Private Warrants: (i) would not be redeemable by the Company and (ii) may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or any of their permitted transferees. If the Private Warrants are held by holders other than the initial purchasers or any of their permitted transferees, the Private Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by the holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants. 
The Private Warrants were initially classified as derivative liability instruments as they met the definition of a derivative and were not considered indexed in the Company's own stock as the settlement value could be dependent on who held the Private Warrants at the time of exercise. Upon the Closing of the ATSP Merger, the Company modified its Private Warrants to be identical to its Public Warrants. Therefore, the Private Warrants met requirements for classification as equity instruments, as they are indexed to the Company’s stock. 
In December 2024, the Company issued 
2,041
 shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock resulting from the exercise of Public Warrants and Private Warrants that were outstanding and raised $
23.5
 thousand in cash proceeds. As of December 31, 2024, there were 
3,663,955
 Public Warrants and Private Warrants issued and outstanding. There was 
no
 exercise during the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.
NOTE 10. 
NOTE PAYABLE
SNAP June 2020 Note
In June 2020, the Company issued a promissory note (the “SNAP June 2020 Note”) to a Lender in exchange for $
15.0
 million in cash proceeds. The note had an annual interest rate of 
5
% and a maturity date of June 26, 2022, if not converted earlier pursuant to conversion terms and change in control events.
The Company recognized total interest expense of $
0.7
 million associated with the SNAP June 2020 Note for the year ended December 31, 2022, out of which $
0.4
 million relates to amortization of the debt discount. The debt discount related to the SNAP June 2020 Note is amortized over the life of the instrument, beginning at note issuance and ending on April 26, 2022, the date on which the note was converted. The Company was amortizing the discounts on an effective interest basis over the period from issuance through the Early Maturity Date. The effective interest rate was 
14.3
% for the year ended December 31, 2022.
As a result of the Business Combination, on the Closing Date, the SNAP June 2020 Note conversion feature was triggered. As a result, on the Closing Date, all outstanding principal of $
15.0
 million and accrued interest of $
1.4
 million were converted into 
2,046,827
 shares of Class A Common Stock. In addition, the remaining debt discount of $
0.2
 million and related derivative liability with fair value of $
4.1
 million as of the Closing Date were extinguished.
SVB March 2021 Note
In March 2021, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement with a commercial bank to borrow $
30.0
 million. The loan bore interest at an annual rate equal to the greater of 
9.00
% or 
5.75
% above the Prime Rate. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the interest rate was 
13.75
%. Payments were interest-only for the first twelve months and are now principal and interest through maturity. There was 
no
 interest expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2024. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company

In connection with the SVB March 2021 Note prepayment, the Company paid a total of $

18.1

0.1
 million and (iv) a nominal amount for transaction expenses, resulting in a loss on debt extinguishment of $
0.4

SCI June 2021 Note
In June 2021, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement with a lender to obtain credit extensions to the Company. Extensions were available in $
5.0
 million increments up to a total commitment amount of $
15.0
 million. The Company drew an initial $
5.0
 million on June 14, 2021 and the remaining $
10.0
 million on December 1, 2021. The loan bore interest at an annual rate equal to the greater of 
9.00
% or 
5.75
% above the Prime Rate. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the interest rate was 
13.75
%. Payments were interest-only for the first twelve months and principal and interest through maturity. There was no interest expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2024. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company recorded $
31
 thousand and $
0.8
 million related to the amortization of the debt discounts in interest expense, respectively.
Concurrently with the Company’s entry into the Credit Agreement (as defined below), the Company used a portion of the proceeds to prepay in full all outstanding obligations under, and terminated, the SCI June 2021 Note. In connection with the SCI June 2021 Note p
repayment on 
April 14, 2023
, the Company paid a total of approximately 
$
11.7

 million
, (ii) a prepayment premium of approximately 
$
0.2
 million
 and (iii) a nominal amount for transaction expenses resulting in a loss on debt extinguishment of 
$
0.4
 million.
Term Loan
On April 14, 2023 (the “Term Loan Closing Date”), the Company entered into a Senior Secured Term Loan Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement provides for a term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $
100.0
 million (the “Term Loan”). The Credit Agreement also permits the Company to request additional commitments of up to $
25.0
 million in the aggregate, with funding of such commitments in the sole discretion of the lenders, under certain circumstances, which will be subject to the same terms as the Term Loan if funded. On the Term Loan closing date, the Company also entered into Guarantee and Collateral Agreement. In addition, the Company is obligated to pay incremental lender fees (the "Lender Fees"), beginning on the Term Loan closing date, initially at the rate of 
3.50
% of the principal amount of the Term Loans for the first 
18
 months paid semi-annually to provide a collateral protection insurance policy on behalf of the lenders. Such rate for the Lender Fees will decrease to 
2.50
% after the 18-month anniversary of the Term Loan Closing Date. As the lenders are the sole beneficiary of the insurance policy, the Lender Fees are deemed to be additional fees payable to the Lenders and is therefore being recognized as interest expense over the term of the Term Loan based on effective interest method.
The Company used the proceeds from the Term Loan to (i) repay outstanding amounts equal to approximately $
30.0
 million under the Company’s existing loan facilities, (ii) fund an escrow account on the Term Loan Closing Date in the name of the Agent for an amount equal to the first four interest payments, (iii) pay certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with entering into the Credit Agreement, and (iv) fund the Lender Fees, together with related taxes, with the remaining proceeds to be used to fund growth investments and for general corporate purposes as permitted under the Credit Agreement.
The outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan bears interest at the applicable margin plus, at the Company’s election, either (i) the Term SOFR published by CME Group Benchmark Administration Limited for a one-month interest period plus 
0.15
% or (ii) the alternate base rate (“ABR”), which is a per annum rate equal to the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), (b) the NYFRB Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus 
0.50
% and (c) the Term SOFR plus 
1.00
%. The applicable margin under the Credit Agreement is 
8.50
% per annum 
104
Table of Contents
SOUNDHOUND AI, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
with respect to SOFR loans, and 
7.50
% per annum with respect to ABR loans. As of June 30, 2024, the contractual interest rate was approximately 
14.0
%. 
The Company was amortizing th
e discounts on an effective interest basis over the period from issuance through April 14, 2027 (the “Maturity Date”). The effective interest rate was 
25.18
% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. The Company incurred $
6.0
 million in stated interest in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2024, and paid $
3.5
 million for the period. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded $
1.5
 million in interest expense related to the debt discount. 
On June 7, 2024, the Company entered into a letter agreement (the “Payoff Letter”) to prepay in full all indebtedness and other amounts outstanding and owing 
under the Credit Agreement. 
In connection with the Term Loan prepayment, the Company paid a total of $
105.6
 million on June 7, 2024, which consisted of (i) the remaining principal amount outstanding of $
100.0
 million, (ii) a prepayment premium of $
5.0
 million, (iii) transaction expenses of $
0.6
 million, resulting in a loss on debt extinguishment of $

2.6
 million was waived under the Payoff Letter. 
Amelia Debt
In connection with the Amelia Acquisition, the Company assumed the amended senior secured term loan facility from Amelia in an aggregate principal amount of $
121.5
 million, which was issued pursuant to the existing Credit Agreement (the “Amelia Debt Credit Agreement”) of Amelia with Monroe Capital Management Advisors, LLC (“Monroe”), as administrative and collateral agent for certain affiliated funds of Monroe, as lenders. In accordance with the terms of the debt assumed, on August 7, 2024, the Company paid $
70.0
 million in cash to pay down a portion of the outstanding principal balance and issued 
2,943,917
 shares of Class A common stock to settle certain fees associated with the Amelia Debt. The remaining outstanding balance of $
39.7
 million has a maturity date of June 30, 2026 (the “Maturity Date”) and provides, at the Company’s election, for payment of a portion of interest in cash or in kind ("PIK"), in which case interest will be capitalized and added to the outstanding principal amount, with principal and accrued interest due at the Maturity Date. The Amelia Debt may be prepaid at any time and must be prepaid, along with the applicable prepayment premium and exit fee, upon the occurrence of certain future events. The Amelia Debt will accrue interest at an annual rate equal to the sum of (a) Adjusted Term SOFR and (b)(i) an applicable margin of 
9.00
% for the portion of interest paid in cash, and (ii) an additional 
1.00
% for the portion of interest paid in kind. Upon an event of default, the interest rate will automatically increase by an additional 
2.00
% per annum, and may result in the declaration that all outstanding principal and interest under the Amelia Debt be immediately due and payable in whole or in part. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded and paid $
2.0
 million in interest expense, of which $
0.1
 million was paid to settle the PIK that was capitalized and added to the outstanding principal amount.

The Company estimated the Level 3 fair value of the liability related to the ELOC using contractual inputs of the commitment shares and reimbursement fees prior to the settlement. The Company determined that the ELOC was not indexed to the Company’s own common stock and, therefore, should be accounted for in accordance with ASC 815: Derivatives. Accordingly, the Company recorded a derivative liability with an initial fair value of $
1.1
 million based on the upfront commitment fee and the reimbursement amount to the investor as consideration for its irrevocable commitment to purchase up to 
25,000,000
 shares of the Company's common stock. 
Subsequent changes in the fair value of the derivative liability are dependent upon, among other things, changes in the closing share price of the Company’s common stock, the quantity and purchase price of shares purchased during the reporting period, the unused capacity under the ELOC as of the balance sheet date and the cost of raising other forms of capital. The Company adjusts the previous fair value estimate of the committed equity facility at each reporting period based on changes in the weighted average purchase price of shares purchased during the period, the unused capacity available under the ELOC, expected stock price volatility and other macroeconomic factors which impact the cost of raising comparable forms of capital. 
The changes in the fair value of the committed equity facility were an increase of $
1.9
 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which is included in other (income) expense, net on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). The fair value of the liability then is remeasured as of the settlement date equal to the difference between the volume weighted average price at a 
3
% discount compared to the fair value of the common stock. 
Derivative Liability (SNAP June 2020 Note)
To determine the fair value of the embedded derivative associated with the SNAP June 2020 Note, the Company utilized the income approach model using the With and Without method. Using the With and Without method, the Company modeled expected cash flows to the noteholder under Next Equity Financing, Change in Control, SPAC/Private Investment in Public Equity, and IPO scenarios. The value of the embedded derivative was determined as the differential value from the perspective of the With and Without Method. 
The Company utilized the following assumptions at the valuation date:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
the term would result in significantly lower (higher) fair value measurements. Significant increases (decreases) in the discount rate would result in significantly lower (higher) fair value measurements.
On April 26, 2022, the Closing of the Business Combination, the embedded derivative was valued at fair value which was equivalent to its intrinsic value. The embedded derivative had a fair value of $
4.1
 million. As the Closing of the Business Combination triggered the Conversion Feature contained within the SNAP June 2020 Note, therefore converting the note’s principal to equity, the embedded derivative associated with the note was extinguished. The Company recorded the remeasurement of derivative liabilities in other expense, net on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The fair value of the embedded derivative was recorded as 
additional paid-in capital
 upon extinguishment on the consolidated balance sheet.

Term Loan and Term Loan Warrant
The fair value of the Company's variable rate Term Loan approximates aggregate principal amount as the interest rate of the loan approximates market rates. 
The Company issued a Class A Common Stock warrant in connection with the Term Loan (see Note 9 for additional information). The warrant was recorded based on the allocation of its relative fair value of the debt proceeds of $
4.1
 million. The warrants were classified as equity instruments at inception with a corresponding discount recorded at issuance against the outstanding note payable in connection with the Term Loan. The common stock warrant is not subject to remeasurement at each subsequent balance sheet date due to its classification as an equity instrument as it is considered indexed to the Company’s stock. The Term Loan warrant expires in April 2033.
The Company determined the fair value of the Term Loan common stock warrant at issuance using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model using the following assumptions:

The fair value of the Contingent Holdback Consideration was initially measured on January 3, 2024, the date on which the Company completed the acquisition of SYNQ3. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized a loss of $

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
The Company utilizes a Monte Carlo simulation to value the contingent earnout consideration. The Company selected this model as it believes it is reflective of all significant assumptions that market participants would likely consider in negotiating the transfer of the contingent earnout consideration. Such assumptions include, among other inputs, expected stock price volatility, risk-free rates, and change in control assumptions. The Company estimates the expected volatility of its common stock based on historical volatility of a peer group, considering the remaining term of the contingent earnout consideration. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve on the valuation date for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the contingent earnout consideration. The expected life of the contingent earnout consideration is assumed to be equivalent to their remaining contractual term. The dividend rate is based on the historical rate, which the Company anticipates to remain at 
zero

The shares issued and held in escrow for the Amelia Acquisition are participating securities that contractually entitle the holders of such shares to participate in the combined entity’s earnings but do not contractually require the holders of such shares to participate in the combined entity’s losses. The weighted average shares outstanding used to calculate basic and diluted net income per share attributable to common stockholders excludes the

Based on available objective evidence, management believes it is more-likely-than-not that the domestic federal and state deferred tax assets; and excess Canadian SR&ED tax credits will not be fully realized due to the Company’s cumulative losses arising in the United States, and its inability to utilize excess tax credits in Canada. Accordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities against its federal and state deferred tax assets and excess Canadian SR&ED tax credits as of December 31, 2024, and 2023. The valuation allowance increased by $
37.3
 million from the year ended December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024.
The Company has not provided U.S. income or foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2024 because it intends to indefinitely reinvest such earnings outside of the U.S. If these foreign earnings were to be repatriated in the future, the related U.S. tax liability will not be material.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of $
548.4
 million of U.S. federal and $
208.1
 million of state net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will start to expire in 2025 and 2028, respectively, with the exception of $
403.3
 million federal net operating loss carryforwards and $
11.0
 million state net operating loss carryforwards, which can be carried forward indefinitely.
The Company had federal and state research and development credit carryforwards of $
21.4
 million and $
13.3
 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2024. The federal credits will expire starting in 2029 if not utilized. The state credits can be carried forward indefinitely. The Company also had Canadian SR&ED tax credits of $
1.6
 million, which will expire starting in 2038 if not utilized.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and similar state tax laws, utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits may be subject to annual limitations due to certain ownership changes. The Company’s net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits could expire before utilization if subject to annual limitations.
The Company files U.S. federal income tax returns as well as income tax returns in many U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2024, the tax years 2005 through the current period remain open to examination by the major jurisdictions in which the Company is subject to tax. Fiscal years outside the normal statute of limitation remain open to audit by tax authorities due to tax attributes generated in those early years, which have been carried forward and may be audited in subsequent years when utilized.

NOTE 22. 
REVISION OF PREVIOUSLY ISSUED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
During the period ended September 30, 2023, the Company identified immaterial prior period errors related to the following: 1) accounting for the ELOC as a derivative instrument; 2) classification of Lender Fees and allocation of the warrants in connection with the Term Loan; and 3) the incorrect recording of in-kind dividends associated with the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock. The identified errors were included in the Company's previously issued annual consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022.
In accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99, “Materiality,” and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements;” the Company evaluated the errors and determined that the related impacts were not material to its consolidated financial statements for the prior year periods when they occurred, but the Company determined it would be appropriate to correct the errors in the current period in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of cash flows or consolidated statements of redeemable convertible preferred stock and stockholders’ deficit for any periods impacted.
The Company revised the previously issued consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss and consolidated statements of cash flows, and consolidated statements of redeemable convertible preferred stock and stockholders’ deficit tables as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 to correct for such errors. All relevant prior period amounts affected by these revisions have been corrected in the notes in this Form 10-K.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
On January 24, 2025, the Company entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the "Second Equity Distribution Agreement") with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Wedbush Securities Inc., Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc. and Northland Securities, Inc. with respect to an at-the-market equity program under which the Company may offer and sell up to $
250.0
 million of shares of its Class A Common Stock from time to time through the Sales Managers. Sales of our Class A Common Stock, if any, under the Second Equity Distribution Agreement will be made at market prices by any method that is deemed to be an “at the market offering” as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act. The Sales Managers will be entitled to commission at a fixed rate of 
2.0
% of the gross sales price per share for their services in acting as agent in the sale of the Company's Class A Common Stock. In January and February 2025, the Company sold 
4,248,900
 shares of our common stock under the Second Equity Distribution Agreement, at an average price of 
$
15.94

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2024 due to the material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting described below. However, after giving full consideration to the material weaknesses described below, and the additional analyses and other procedures management performed to ensure that its consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company’s management has concluded that its consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, its financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods disclosed in conformity with U.S. GAAP.
Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework 
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company’s annual or interim financial statements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The Company did not maintain an effective control environment as it lacked sufficient oversight of activities related to its internal control over financial reporting due to a lack of appropriate level of experience and training commensurate with its financial reporting requirements. Further, due to rapid business growth, changes to existing controls or the implementation of new controls have not been sufficient to respond to changes to the risks of material misstatement to financial reporting, which resulted in the Company, including the SYNQ3 and Amelia entities which were acquired during 2024, not designing and maintaining effective controls related to substantially all accounts and disclosures. These material weaknesses contributed to the following additional material weaknesses as of December 31, 2024:
•
The Company did not design and maintain effective controls related to the identification of and accounting for certain non-routine, unusual or complex transactions, including the accounting for complex financing transactions and acquisitions. 
•
The Company did not design and maintain effective controls to verify appropriate segregation of duties, including assessment of incompatible duties, identification of instances where incompatible duties were assigned to an individual, and addressing conflicts on a timely basis.
•
The Company did not design and maintain effective controls over certain information technology (IT) general controls over information systems that are relevant to the preparation of the Company’s financial statements. Specifically, the Company did not design and maintain: (i) user access controls to ensure appropriate segregation of duties and to adequately restrict user and privileged access to appropriate personnel; (ii) program change management controls to ensure that program and data changes are identified, tested, authorized and implemented appropriately; and (iii) computer operations controls to ensure that processing and transfer of data, and data backups and recovery are monitored. 
128
Table of Contents
The material weaknesses related to the control environment, risk assessment and the accounting for certain non-routine, unusual or complex transactions resulted in the revision of the consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods ended September 30, 2022, December 31, 2022, March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023, immaterial errors related to SYNQ3 and Amelia acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2024 and immaterial errors in various accounts during the interim and annual periods during 2023 and 2024. The material weaknesses related to segregation of duties and IT general controls did not result in a misstatement to our annual or interim consolidated financial statements. Additionally, the material weaknesses could result in misstatements to substantially all of our accounts and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement of the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.
Because of these material weaknesses, management concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears under Item 8.
Management's Plan to Remediate the Material Weaknesses
The following remediation actions are currently being implemented and are in progress:
•
Engaged a third party to perform a risk assessment that includes the identification and walkthrough of key business processes and conducting design and operational control testing to address key risks.
•
Completed a segregation of duties assessment identifying key conflicts and mitigating controls.
•
Initiated the design and implementation of a Segregation of Duties automated tool for our Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. Additionally, we have initiated the design and implementation of similar controls for the remaining financially relevant applications. Improvements have been implemented in tool utilization to strengthen the segregation of duties. 
•
Initiated the design and implementation of controls related to the review of Service Organization Control reports, which cover program change management and computer operations for many of the applications that we rely on for financial reporting.
•
Developed policies and procedures for the quarterly user access review of all users with access to the financially relevant systems and then implemented the quarterly user access review for one design cycle.
•
Initiated the design and implementation of the controls related to review and approval of complex financing transactions.
•
Completed the implementation of an automated month and quarter-end accounting close workflow tool to facilitate the review and support of key financial close process controls.
As it specifically relates to the fourth quarter of 2024, the following actions were taken:
•
Hired additional personnel with expertise in risk assessment and internal controls.
•
Initiated the implementation of technological enhancements including the consolidation of disparate ERP systems.
•
Elevated internal compliance processes.
The material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until management completes the design and implementation of the measures described above, the controls operate for a sufficient period of time, and management has concluded, through testing, that the controls are effective.
