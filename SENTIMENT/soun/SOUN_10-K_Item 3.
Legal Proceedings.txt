CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Annual Report on Form 10-K of SoundHound AI, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” “SoundHound,” or the “Company”) contains “forward-looking statements” (as defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended that reflect our current expectations and views of future events. The forward-looking statements are contained principally in the section of this report entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” You can identify some of these forward-looking statements by words or phrases such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “aim,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “is/are likely to,” “potential,” “continue” or other similar expressions. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning our expected financial performance, our ability to implement our business strategy and anticipated business and operations, including our ability to integrate the business and operations of our recent acquisitions and improve our Generative AI Foundation Model, expand our customer partnerships and roll out our AI drive thru service, roll out our Dynamic Interaction, Chat AI for Automotive, and expand the number of platforms on which our voice AI technology will be available, the potential utility of and market for our products and services, including our newly acquired products and services, and our ability to achieve revenue from our bookings backlog. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy and financial needs. Although we believe that our expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, our expectations may later be found to be incorrect. Our actual results of operations or the results of other matters that we anticipate herein could be materially different from our expectations. Accordingly, readers are cautioned that significant known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ include:
•
our ability to execute our business strategy, including launching new product offerings and expanding information and technology capabilities;
•
our market opportunity and our ability to acquire new customers and retain existing customers;
•
the timing and impact of our growth initiatives on our future financial performance;
•
our ability to integrate the businesses and operations from our recent acquisitions with our current operations to realize the expected benefits of those acquisitions;
•
our ability to protect intellectual property and trade secrets;
•
our ability to obtain additional capital, as necessary, including equity or debt financing, 
on terms that are acceptable to us, if at all
;
•
changes in applicable laws or regulations and extensive and evolving government regulations that impact our operations and business;
•
our ability to attract or maintain a qualified workforce;
•
level of product service failures that could lead our customers to use competitors’ services;
•
investigations, claims, disputes, enforcement actions, litigation and/or other regulatory or legal proceedings, including with respect to our AI technology;
•
risks relating to uncertainty of our estimates of market opportunity and forecasts of market growth;
•
the possibility that we may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; and
•
other risks and uncertainties described under the section titled “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report.
You should thoroughly read this Annual Report and the documents that we refer to with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from, and worse than, what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.
The forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report relate only to events or information as of the date of this Annual Report. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-

looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, after the date on which the statements are made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.
