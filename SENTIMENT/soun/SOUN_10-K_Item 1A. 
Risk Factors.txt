investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations and the market price of our securities.
Summary
The risk factors described below are a summary of the principal risk factors associated with an investment in us. These are not the only risks we face. You should carefully consider these risk factors and the other reports and documents filed by us with the SEC.
Risks Related to our Business and Financial Condition
•
We have generated substantial net losses and negative operating cash flows since inception and may never achieve or maintain profitability or generate positive cash flows;
•
We may require additional capital to continue planned business operations but may not be able to obtain such capital when desired on favorable terms, if at all, or without dilution to our stockholders;
•
Our operating results could be materially and adversely affected if it loses any of its largest customers due to concentration risk;
•
The market in which we operate is highly competitive and rapidly changing and we may be unable to compete successfully;
•
Adverse conditions in the Voice AI market or the global economy more generally could have adverse effects on our results of operations;
•
We depend on skilled employees and the loss of one or more key members of our management team or personnel, or our failure to attract, integrate and retain additional personnel in the future, could harm our business and negatively affect our ability to successfully grow our business;

Our Class B Common Stock has multiple votes per share and this ownership will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transactions requiring stockholder approval, and that may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A Common stock; and
Risks Related to U.S. and International Taxation
•
Our ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.
Risks Related to SoundHound’s Business and Financial Condition
Our use and provision of AI-powered solutions could lead to operational or reputational damage, competitive harm, legal and regulatory risk and additional costs.
Use and provision of AI, including generative AI, is a core part of our business. The use of generative AI, a relatively new and emerging technology in the early stages of commercial use, exposes us to additional risks, such as damage to our reputation, competitive position and business, legal and regulatory risks and additional costs. For example, generative AI has been known to produce false or “hallucinatory” inferences or output, and certain generative AI uses machine learning and predictive analytics, which can create inaccurate, incomplete or misleading output, unintended biases and other discriminatory or unexpected results, errors or inadequacies, any of which may not be easily detectable. Accordingly, while AI-powered applications may help provide more tailored or personalized user experiences, if the content, analyses or recommendations that AI-powered solutions assist in producing on our products and services are, or are perceived to be, deficient, inaccurate, biased, unethical or otherwise flawed, our reputation, competitive position and business may be materially and adversely affected.
Additionally, if any of our employees, contractors, vendors or service providers use any third-party AI-powered software in connection with our business or the services they provide to us, it may lead to the inadvertent disclosure of our confidential information, including inadvertent disclosure of our confidential information into publicly available third-party training sets, which may impact our ability to realize the benefit of, or adequately maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property or confidential information, harming our competitive position and business. Our ability to mitigate risks associated with disclosure of our confidential information, including in connection with AI-powered software, will depend on our implementation, maintenance, monitoring and enforcement of appropriate technical and administrative safeguards, policies and procedures governing the use of AI in our business.
11
Table of Contents
Additionally, any content created by us using generative AI tools may not be subject to copyright protection which may adversely affect our intellectual property rights in, or ability to commercialize or use, any such content. In the United States, a number of civil lawsuits have been initiated related to the foregoing and other concerns, the outcome of any one of which may, amongst other things, require us to limit the ways in which we use AI in our business and may affect our ability to develop our AI-powered platform innovations and features. For example, the output produced by generative AI tools may include information subject to certain rights of publicity or privacy laws or constitute an unauthorized derivative work of the copyrighted material used in training the underlying AI model, any of which could also create a risk of liability for us, or adversely affect our business or operations. In addition, the use of AI has resulted in, and may in the future result in, cybersecurity breaches or incidents that implicate the personal data of users of AI-powered applications. To the extent that we do not have sufficient rights to use the data or other material or content used in or produced by the generative AI tools used in our business, or if we experience cybersecurity breaches or incidents in connection with our use of AI, it could adversely affect our reputation and expose us to legal liability or regulatory risk, including with respect to third-party intellectual property, privacy, publicity, contractual or other rights. Further, our competitors or other third parties may incorporate AI into their products more quickly or more successfully than us, which could impair our ability to compete effectively.
As the utilization of AI becomes more prevalent, we anticipate that it will continue to present new or unanticipated ethical, reputational, technical, operational, legal, competitive and regulatory issues, among others. We expect that such utilization of AI will require additional resources, including the incurrence of additional costs, to develop and maintain our platform offerings, services and features to minimize potentially harmful or unintended consequences, to comply with applicable and emerging laws and regulations, to maintain or extend our competitive position and to address any ethical, reputational, technical, operational, legal, competitive or regulatory issues which may arise as a result of any of the foregoing. As a result, the challenges presented with our use of AI could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Regulatory and legislative developments related to the use of AI could adversely affect our use and provision of AI-powered solutions in our products, services and business.
As the regulatory framework for machine learning technology, generative AI and automated decision making evolves, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. The regulatory framework for AI and similar technologies, and automated decision making, is changing rapidly. It is possible that new laws and regulations will be adopted in the United States and in non-U.S. jurisdictions, or that existing laws and regulations may be interpreted in ways that would affect our use and provision of AI-powered solutions in our products, services and business. We may not be able to adequately anticipate or respond to these evolving laws and regulations, and we may need to expend additional resources to adjust our offerings in certain jurisdictions if applicable legal frameworks are inconsistent across jurisdictions. In addition, because these technologies are themselves highly complex and rapidly developing, it is not possible to predict all of the legal or regulatory risks that may arise relating to our use of such technologies. Further, the cost to comply with such laws or regulations could be significant and would increase our operating expenses, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
For example, in Europe, the European Parliament formally enacted the European Union’s Artificial Intelligence Act (the “AI Act”). The AI Act establishes, among other things, a risk-based governance framework for regulating AI systems operating in the European Union. This framework seeks to categorize AI systems, based on the risks associated with such AI systems’ intended purposes, as creating unacceptable or high risks, with all other AI systems being considered low risk. While the AI Act has only recently been enacted, there is a risk that our current or future AI-powered software or applications may obligate us to comply with the applicable requirements of the AI Act, which may impose additional costs on us, increase our risk of liability or adversely affect our business. For example, the AI Act would prohibit certain uses of AI systems and place numerous obligations on providers and deployers of permitted AI systems, with heightened requirements based on AI systems that are considered high risk. If enacted in this form or a similar form, this regulatory framework is expected to have a material impact on the way AI is regulated in the European Union and beyond, and, together with developing regulatory guidance and judicial decisions in this area, may affect our use of AI and our ability to provide and to improve our services, require additional compliance measures and changes to our operations and processes, result in increased compliance costs and potential increases in civil claims against us and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 The market in which SoundHound operates is highly competitive and rapidly changing and SoundHound may be unable to compete successfully.
12
Table of Contents
There are a number of companies that develop or may develop products that compete in the Voice AI market. The market for SoundHound’s products and technologies is characterized by intense competition, evolving industry and regulatory standards, emerging business and distribution models, disruptive software technology developments, short product and service life cycles, price sensitivity on the part of customers, and frequent new product introductions, including alternatives to certain of SoundHound’s products from other vendors which may be offered at significantly lower costs or free of charge. Current and potential competitors have established, or may establish, cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their technologies to address the needs of SoundHound’s current and prospective customers. Furthermore, current or prospective customers may decide to develop competing products or to establish, strategic relationships with SoundHound’s competitors.
Competition in the Voice AI market could adversely affect SoundHound’s operating results by reducing the volume of the products and technologies SoundHound licenses or sells, the prices SoundHound can charge or the obligations of SoundHound to incur expenses or capital costs associated with the development, acquisition or promotion of new products or technologies. Some of SoundHound’s current or potential competitors are large technology companies that have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than SoundHound does, and others are smaller specialized companies that possess specialized expertise or regional focus and may have greater price flexibility than SoundHound does in connection with their business models. These competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than SoundHound can to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements, or may decide to offer products at low or unsustainable cost to win new business or to retain their existing clients. They may also devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than SoundHound does, and in certain cases may be able to include or combine their competitive products or technologies with other of their products or technologies in a manner whereby the competitive functionality is available at lower cost or free of charge within the larger offering. To the extent they do so, the penetration of SoundHound’s products, and therefore its revenue, may be adversely affected. SoundHound’s large competitors may also have greater access to customer data, which provides them with a competitive advantage in developing new products and technologies. SoundHound’s success depends substantially upon its ability to enhance its products and technologies, to develop and introduce, on a timely and cost-effective basis, new products and technologies that meet changing customer requirements and incorporate technological enhancements, and to maintain SoundHound’s alignment with the technologies and market strategies of its customers, which change and advance over time. If SoundHound is unable to develop new products and enhance functionalities or technologies to adapt to these changes and maintain SoundHound’s alignment with its customers, its business will suffer.
Adverse conditions in the Voice AI market or the global economy more generally could have adverse effects on SoundHound’s results of operations.
SoundHound’s business depends on, and is directly affected by, the global Voice AI market, as well as the global economy more generally, including global economic trends affecting the automotive, internet of things (“IoT”), mobile application, call center, semiconductor device maker and restaurant and hospitality industries. For example, SoundHound’s largest customers are currently in the automotive industry, and automotive production and sales are highly cyclical and depend on general economic conditions and other factors, including consumer spending and preferences, changes in interest rate levels and credit availability, tariffs, consumer confidence, fuel costs, fuel availability, environmental impact, union strikes, governmental incentives and regulatory requirements, and political volatility, especially in energy-producing countries and growth markets. Such factors may also negatively impact consumer demand for products, including automobiles, that incorporate or use SoundHound products or technologies. In addition, global production and sales trends can be affected by SoundHound’s customers’ ability to continue operating in response to challenging economic conditions, and in response to labor relations issues, regulatory requirements, trade agreements and other factors. The volume of global automotive production, in particular, has fluctuated, sometimes significantly, from year to year, and such fluctuations give rise to fluctuations in the demand for SoundHound’s products. Any significant adverse change in any of these factors, including, but not limited to, general economic conditions and the resulting bankruptcy of a customer or the closure of a customer manufacturing facility, may result in a reduction in sales and production by SoundHound’s customers, and could have a material adverse effect on SoundHound’s business, results of operations and financial condition.
SoundHound’s strategy to increase cloud connected and embedded products and technologies and expand the number of foreign languages SoundHound understands may adversely affect its near-term revenue growth and results of operations.
SoundHound has been and is continuing to develop new cloud-connected and embedded products and technologies. The design and development of new cloud-connected and embedded products and technologies and the addition of new languages will involve significant expense. SoundHound’s research and development costs have greatly increased in 
13
Table of Contents
recent years and, together with certain expenses associated with delivering SoundHound’s connected services, are projected to continue to escalate in the near future. SoundHound may encounter difficulties with designing, developing, and releasing new cloud-connected and embedded components, as well as integrating these components with SoundHound’s existing technologies. These development issues may further increase costs and may affect SoundHound’s ability to innovate in a manner that allows SoundHound to remain competitive relative to its peers. As a result, SoundHound’s strategy to incorporate more cloud-connected and embedded components may adversely affect its revenue growth and results of operations.
Pricing pressures from SoundHound’s customers may adversely affect its results of operations.
SoundHound may experience pricing pressure from its customers in the future, including, relative to its automotive industry customers, pricing pressure resulting from the strong purchasing power of major OEMs SoundHound may be expected to quote fixed prices or be forced to accept prices with annual price reduction commitments for long-term sales arrangements or discounted reimbursements for SoundHound’s work. Any price reductions could impact SoundHound’s sales and profit margins. SoundHound’s profitability is also influenced by its success in designing and marketing technological improvements in Voice AI systems. If SoundHound is unable to offset any price reductions in the future, its business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.
Currently, SoundHound’s largest customers are OEMs, and while SoundHound invests effort and money seeking OEMs’ validation of SoundHound’s technology, and there can be no assurance that SoundHound will win or be able to renew its contracts with OEM customers, which could adversely affect SoundHound’s results of operations.
Some of SoundHound’s largest customers are currently OEMs and SoundHound invests effort and money in product research and development in relationship to SoundHound’s OEM customers from the time an OEM or a “Tier 1” supplier to OEMs begins designing for an upcoming program through the date on which an OEM or Tier 1 supplier customer chooses SoundHound’s technology to be incorporated directly or indirectly into one or more specific vehicle models to be produced by such customer. This selection process is known as a “design win.” SoundHound could expend its resources on these and similar efforts without success. After a design win, a product or technology that did not receive the design win may not be able to displace the winner until the customer begins a new selection process because it is very unlikely that a customer will change complex technology until a product model is revamped. In addition, the company with the winning design may have an advantage with the customer going forward because of the established relationship between the winning company and such customer, which could make it more difficult for such company’s competitors to win the designs for other service contracts. Even if SoundHound has an established relationship with a customer, any failure to perform under a service contract or innovate in response to their feedback may neutralize its advantage with that customer. If SoundHound fails to win a significant number of customer design competitions in the future or to renew a significant number of existing service contracts, SoundHound’s operating results would be adversely affected. Moreover, to the extent SoundHound is unable to renew existing service contracts, this would negatively impact its revenue. The period of time from winning a contract to implementation is long and SoundHound is subject to the risks of cancellation or postponement of the contract or unsuccessful implementation.
SoundHound’s products are technologically complex and incorporate many technological innovations. Prospective customers generally must make significant commitments of resources to test and validate SoundHound’s products before including them in a product or vehicle. The development cycles of SoundHound’s products with new customers are approximately six months to two years after a design win, depending on the customer and the complexity of the product. These development cycles result in SoundHound investing its resources in customers and customer products prior to realizing any revenues from the related customer contracts. Further, SoundHound is subject to the risk that a customer cancels or postpones implementation of SoundHound’s technology, as well as that SoundHound will not be able to implement its technology successfully. Additionally, SoundHound’s sales could be less than forecast if the product is unsuccessful, including for reasons unrelated to its technology. Long development cycles and product cancellations or postponements may adversely affect SoundHound’s business, results of operations.
SoundHound’s operating results could be materially and adversely affected if it loses any of its largest customers.
The loss of business from any of SoundHound’s major customers, whether by lower overall demand for the products manufactured by its major customers, cancellation of existing contracts or the failure to award SoundHound new business, could have a material adverse effect on SoundHound’s operating results. Alternatively, there is a risk that one or more of SoundHound’s major customers could be unable to pay its invoices as they become due or that a customer will simply refuse to make such payments given its financial difficulties. If a major customer becomes subject to bankruptcy or similar 
14
Table of Contents
proceedings whereby contractual commitments are subject to stay of execution and the possibility of legal or other modification, or if a major customer otherwise successfully procures protection against SoundHound legally enforcing its obligations, it is likely that SoundHound will be forced to record a substantial loss. In addition, certain of SoundHound’s customers that are tier 1 suppliers to the automotive industry exclusively sell to certain OEMs, including some of SoundHound’s other customers. A bankruptcy of, or other significant disruption to, any of these OEMs could intensify any adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, one customer accounted for 14% of SoundHound's total revenues. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, two and three customers accounted for the following approximate percentages of SoundHound’s total revenues during the respective applicable period: 62% and 67%. Accounts receivable balances due from one customer totaled 23% of the Company’s consolidated accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2024. Accounts receivable balances due from three customers collectively totaled 87% of the Company’s consolidated accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2023. The unbilled receivables balances from two customers collectively totaled 74% of the Company’s consolidated unbilled receivables balance at December 31, 2024. The unbilled receivables balances from three customers collectively totaled 86% of the Company’s consolidated unbilled receivables balance at December 31, 2023.
In addition to upfront payments pursuant to professional services or custom engineering agreements, SoundHound generally enters into master service agreements with its largest customers and also provides them with engineering and custom services. Our largest current customers entered into master services agreements with SoundHound pursuant to which they are provided Houndify Cloud Services and, in some cases, associated services on an as-needed basis. The license fees that SoundHound receives under our master services agreements are either fixed minimum monthly hosting fees with overage charges based on usage, or determined based on the volume of products that our customers sell that utilize SoundHound technology. Our master services agreements generally renew automatically for one year terms and are terminable by the customer upon prior written notice of six months to one year. 
Adverse economic conditions or reduced technology spending may adversely impact SoundHound's business.
Our business depends on the overall demand for technology and on the economic performance of our current and prospective customers. In general, worldwide economic conditions may remain unstable, including inflation, in particular in connection with the implementation of tariffs in the U.S. and abroad, and these conditions would make it difficult for our customers, prospective customers and us to forecast and plan future business activities accurately, and they could cause our customers or prospective customers to reevaluate their decision to purchase our features. Weak global economic conditions, changes in consumer behavior or a reduction in technology spending even if economic conditions stabilize, could adversely impact our business and results of operations in a number of ways, including longer sales cycles, lower demand or prices for our platform, fewer subscriptions and lower or no growth. 
SoundHound’s operating results may fluctuate significantly from period to period, and this may cause its stock price to decline.
SoundHound’s operating results may fluctuate materially in the future. These fluctuations may cause SoundHound’s results of operations to not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors which would likely cause the price of its stock to decline. Factors that may contribute to fluctuations in operating results include:
•
the volume, timing and fulfillment of large customer contracts;
•
renewals of existing customer contracts and wins of new customer programs;
•
increased expenditures incurred pursuing new product or market opportunities;
•
receipt of royalty reports;
•
fluctuating sales by SoundHound’s customers to their end-users;
•
contractual counterparties failing to meet their contractual commitments to SoundHound;
•
introduction of new products by SoundHound or its competitors;
15
Table of Contents
•
cybersecurity or data breaches;
•
reduction in the prices of SoundHound’s products in response to competition, market conditions or contractual obligations;
•
increased costs to raise cash in the market place, including increased borrowing costs as a result of inflation and tariffs;
•
accounts receivable that are not collectible;
•
higher than anticipated costs related to fixed-price contracts with SoundHound’s customers;
•
change in costs due to regulatory or trade restrictions;
•
expenses incurred in litigation matters, whether initiated by SoundHound or brought by third-parties against SoundHound, and settlements or judgments it is required to pay in connection with disputes; and
•
general economic trends as they affect the customer bases into which SoundHound and its customers sell and operate.
Due to the foregoing factors, among others, SoundHound’s revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly from period to period. SoundHound’s expense levels are based in significant part on its expectations of future revenue, and SoundHound may not be able to reduce its expenses quickly to respond to near-term shortfalls in projected revenue. Therefore, SoundHound’s failure to meet revenue expectations would seriously harm its operating results, financial condition, and cash flows.
SoundHound depends on skilled employees and could be impacted by a shortage of critical skills.
Much of SoundHound’s future success depends on the continued service and availability of skilled employees, particularly with respect to technical areas. Skilled and experienced personnel in the areas where SoundHound competes are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. Many of SoundHound’s key employees receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. New regulations or volatility in the stock market could diminish SoundHound’s use, and the value, of its equity awards. This would place SoundHound at a competitive disadvantage in attracting qualified personnel or force it to offer more cash compensation.
Cybersecurity and data privacy incidents or breaches may damage client relations and inhibit SoundHound’s growth.
The confidentiality and security of SoundHound’s information, and that of third parties, is critical to SoundHound’s business. SoundHound’s services involve the transmission, use, and storage of customers’ and their customers’ information, which may be confidential or contain personally identifiable information. Any cybersecurity or data privacy incidents could have a material adverse effect on SoundHound’s results of operations and financial condition. While SoundHound maintains a broad array of information security and privacy measures, policies and practices, its networks may be breached through a variety of means, resulting in someone obtaining unauthorized access to SoundHound’s information, to information of SoundHound’s customers or their customers, or to SoundHound’s intellectual property; disabling or degrading service; or sabotaging systems or information. In addition, hardware, software, systems, or applications SoundHound develops or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to SoundHound’s systems or facilities, or those of third parties with whom SoundHound does business, through fraud or other forms of deceiving SoundHound’s employees, contractors, and vendors. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, SoundHound may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. SoundHound will continue to incur significant costs to continuously enhance its information security measures to defend against the threat of cybercrime. Any cybersecurity or data privacy incident or breach may result in:
•
loss of revenue resulting from the operational disruption;
•
loss of revenue or increased bad debt expense due to the inability to invoice properly or to customer dissatisfaction resulting in collection issues;
16
Table of Contents
•
loss of revenue due to loss of customers;
•
material remediation costs to recreate or restore systems;
•
material investments in new or enhanced systems in order to enhance SoundHound’s information security posture;
•
cost of incentives offered to customers to restore confidence and maintain business relationships;
•
reputational damage resulting in the failure to retain or attract customers;
•
costs associated with potential litigation or governmental investigations;
•
costs associated with any required notices of a data breach;
•
costs associated with the potential loss of critical business data;
•
difficulties enhancing or creating new products due to loss of data or data integrity issues; and
•
other consequences of which SoundHound is not currently aware but would discover through the process of remediating any cybersecurity or data privacy incidents or breaches that may occur.
SoundHound’s business is subject to a variety of domestic and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations, including data protection and anticorruption.
SoundHound is subject to U.S. and international laws and regulations in multiple areas, including data protection, anticorruption, labor relations, tax, foreign currency, anti-competition, import, export and trade regulations, and SoundHound is subject to a complex array of federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, disclosure, security and transfer of personally identifiable information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to transfers between unrelated third-parties but also to transfers between SoundHound and its subsidiaries. Many jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. The European Commission adopted the European General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), which went into effect on May 25, 2018. In addition, California adopted significant new consumer privacy laws that became effective beginning in January 2020. Complying with the GDPR and other requirements may cause SoundHound to incur substantial costs and may require it to change our business practices. 
Additionally, China has recently implemented new regulation pertaining to cybersecurity and the protection of personal information, including the Data Security Law which took effect in September 2001 and the Personal Information Protection Law which took effect in November 2021. Interpretation, application and enforcement of these laws, rules and regulations evolve from time to time and their scope may continually change, through new legislation, amendments to existing legislation or changes in enforcement. Compliance with cybersecurity and data security legislation could significantly increase the cost to SoundHound of carrying out its business in China, require significant changes to its operations or even prevent SoundHound from providing certain service offerings in jurisdictions in which SoundHound currently operates or in which it may operate in the future.
Despite SoundHound’s efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulations and other obligations relating to privacy, data protection and information security, it is possible that SoundHound’s practices, offerings or platform could fail to meet all of the requirements imposed on SoundHound by legislation relating to cybersecurity, data security and/or related implementing regulations. Any failure on SoundHound’s part to comply with such law or regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, data protection or information security, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access, use or release of personally identifiable information or other data, or the perception or allegation that any of the foregoing types of failure or compromise has occurred, could damage SoundHound’s reputation, discourage new and existing counterparties from contracting with SoundHound or result in investigations, fines, suspension or other penalties and private claims or litigation, any of which could materially adversely affect SoundHound’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if SoundHound’s practices are not subject to legal challenge, the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may harm its reputation and brand and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, the legal uncertainty created by certain of these laws, including the Data Security Law, and recent government actions could materially adversely affect its ability, on favorable terms, to raise capital. Compliance with data security and personal information protection laws, may result in additional expenses to 
17
Table of Contents
SoundHound and subject it to negative publicity, which could harm SoundHound’s reputation among users and negatively affect the trading price of its shares in the future. Furthermore, SoundHound’s data transfer policies may be subject to additional compliance requirement and regulatory burdens, and SoundHound may be required to make further adjustments to its business practices to comply with the interpretation and implementation of such laws, which may increase our compliance costs and adversely affect our operating results.
Any failure by SoundHound, its customers or other parties with whom SoundHound does business to comply with its privacy policy or with federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against SoundHound by governmental entities or others. Any alleged or actual failure to comply with applicable privacy laws and regulations may:
•
cause SoundHound’s customers to lose confidence in its solutions;
•
harm SoundHound’s reputation;
•
expose SoundHound to litigation, regulatory investigations and to resulting liabilities including reimbursement of customer costs, damages penalties or fines imposed by regulatory agencies; and
•
require SoundHound to incur significant expenses for remediation.
SoundHound is also subject to a variety of anticorruption laws in respect of its international operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and the Canadian Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act, and regulations issued by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, and various other foreign governmental agencies. SoundHound cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which its international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted. Actual or alleged violations of these laws and regulations could lead to enforcement actions and financial penalties that could result in substantial costs.
Because a significant portion of SoundHound’s revenues are derived, and a significant portion of its research and development activities are based, outside the United States, its results could be harmed by economic, political, regulatory, foreign currency fluctuations and other risks associated with these international regions.
Because SoundHound operates worldwide, its business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. SoundHound currently generates most of its international revenue in Europe and Asia, and SoundHound anticipates that revenue from international operations could increase in the future. SoundHound conducts a significant portion of the development of its voice recognition and natural language understanding solutions in Canada, Germany, Japan and China. SoundHound is exposed to fluctuating exchange rates of foreign currencies including the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Chinese RMB, Japanese yen, Indian rupee and South Korean won. Accordingly, SoundHound’s future results could be harmed by a variety of factors associated with international sales and operations, including:
•
adverse political and economic conditions, or changes to such conditions, in a specific region or country;
•
trade protection measures, including tariffs and import/export controls, imposed by the United States and/or by other countries or regional authorities such as China, Canada or the European Union;
•
the impact on local and global economies of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union;
•
changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the lack of ability to hedge certain foreign currencies;
•

Interruptions or delays in SoundHound’s services or services from data center hosting facilities or public clouds could impair the delivery of its services and harm its business.
Because SoundHound’s services are complex and incorporate a variety of third-party hardware and software, its services may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for its customers and harm to its reputation and its business. SoundHound has from time to time, found defects in its services, and new errors in its services may be detected in the future. In addition, SoundHound currently serves its customers from data center hosting facilities or third-party public clouds SoundHound directly manages. Any damage to, or failure of, the systems and facilities that serve SoundHound’s customers in whole or in part could result in interruptions in its service. Interruptions in SoundHound’s service may reduce its revenue, cause SoundHound to issue credits or pay service level agreement penalties, cause customers to terminate their on-demand services, and adversely affect SoundHound’s renewal rates and its ability to attract new customers.
SoundHound is subject to certain U.S. and foreign anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, export control, sanctions, and other trade laws and regulations. SoundHound can face serious consequences for violations.
Among other matters, U.S. and foreign anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, export control, sanctions, and other trade laws and regulations, which are collectively referred to as Trade Laws, prohibit companies and their employees, agents, clinical research organizations, legal counsel, accountants, consultants, contractors, and other partners from authorizing, promising, offering, providing, soliciting, or receiving directly or indirectly, corrupt or improper payments or anything else of value to or from recipients in the public or private sector. Violations of Trade Laws can result in substantial criminal fines and civil penalties, imprisonment, the loss of trade privileges, debarment, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm, and other consequences. SoundHound also expects its non-U.S. activities to increase in time.
SoundHound’s business is subject to risks, expenses and uncertainties associated with selling its solutions in locations outside the United States that could adversely affect its operating results.
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, SoundHound derived approximately 45%, 85% and 89%, respectively, of its revenues from customers located in countries outside the United States, and SoundHound plans to increase its international operations in the future. Accordingly, SoundHound expects to increasingly face significant operational risks and expenses from doing business internationally.
SoundHound’s international operating results may be affected by volatility in currency exchange rates and its ability to effectively manage its currency transaction risks. SoundHound would incur currency transaction risks if SoundHound were to enter into either a purchase or a sale transaction using a different currency from the currency in which SoundHound reports revenue. In such cases, SoundHound may suffer an exchange loss because SoundHound does not currently engage in currency swaps or other currency hedging strategies to address this risk. As SoundHound realizes its strategy to expand internationally, its exposure to currency risks may increase. Given the volatility of exchange rates, SoundHound can give no assurance that it will be able to effectively manage its Currency transaction risks or that any volatility in currency exchange rates will not have a material adverse effect on its results of operations.
Other risks and uncertainties SoundHound faces from its global operations include, but are not limited to:
•
difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;
•
limited protection for the enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights in certain countries where SoundHound may sell SoundHound’s solutions or work with suppliers or other third parties;
•
potentially longer sales and payment cycles and potentially greater difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;

•
rapid changes in government, economic and political policies and conditions; and
•
political or civil unrest or instability, terrorism or epidemics or pandemics and other similar outbreaks or events.
SoundHound’s failure to effectively manage the risks and uncertainties associated with its existing and planned global operations could limit the future growth of its business and adversely affect its operating results.
SoundHound relies on third-party telecommunications and internet service providers, including connectivity to its cloud software, and any failure by these service providers to provide reliable services could cause SoundHound to lose customers and subject it to claims for credits or damages, among other things.
SoundHound relies on services from third-party telecommunications providers in order to provide services to its customers and their customers, including telephone numbers. In addition, SoundHound depends on its internet bandwidth suppliers to provide uninterrupted and error-free service through their networks. SoundHound exercises little control over these third-party providers, which increases its vulnerability to problems with the services they provide.
When problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. Service disruption or outages, whether caused by SoundHound’s service, the products or services of SoundHound’s third-party service providers, or SoundHound’s customers’ or their customers’ equipment and systems, may result in loss of market acceptance of its products and technologies and any necessary remedial actions may force it to incur significant costs and expenses.
20
Table of Contents
If any of these service providers fail to provide reliable services, suffer outages, degrade, disrupt, increase the cost of or terminate the services that SoundHound and its customers depend on, SoundHound may be required to switch to another service provider. Delays caused by switching SoundHound’s technology to another service provider, if available, and qualifying this new service provider could materially harm its operating results. Further, any failure on the part of third-party service providers to achieve or maintain expected performance levels, stability and security could harm SoundHound’s relationships with its customers, cause it to lose customers, result in claims for credits or damages, increase its costs or the costs incurred by its customers, damage its reputation, significantly reduce customer demand for its products and technologies and seriously harm its and operating results.
SoundHound’s customers rely on third-party telecommunications and internet service providers to provide them with access and connectivity to SoundHound’s cloud software, and changes in how telecommunication and internet service providers handle and charge for access to telecommunications and the internet could materially harm SoundHound’s customer relationships, business, financial condition and operations results.
SoundHound’s customers must have access to wireless telecommunications and/or broadband internet access services in order to use certain of its products and certain of its offerings require substantial capacity to operate effectively. In the United States, wireless telecommunications and internet access services are provided by relatively few companies that, depending on the geographic area, have market power over such offerings. It is possible that these companies could charge SoundHound, its customers, or both fees to guarantee a service amount of capacity, or for quality of wireless telecommunications and broadband internet access services, that could advantage SoundHound’s competitors by degrading, disrupting, limiting, or otherwise restricting the use of infrastructure required to support SoundHound’s services. These providers likely have the ability to increase SoundHound's rates, SoundHound’s customers’ rates, or both for wireless telecommunications and/or broadband internet access services which may increase the cost of SoundHound’s products and technologies making its products and technologies less competitive or decreasing SoundHound’s profit margins.
SoundHound’s plans to expand upon and establish new public cloud-based data centers for its U.S. and international operations may be unsuccessful and may present execution and competitive risks.
SoundHound plans to expand upon and establish new public cloud deployments in the future to facilitate its platform in the U.S. and certain international markets. SoundHound may partner with one or more third-parties to develop, test and deploy its technology to offer a full stack of products on the public cloud in the U.S. and certain international markets. SoundHound’s public cloud-based platform offering is critical to developing and providing its products to its customers, scaling its business for future growth, accurately maintaining data and otherwise operating its business. Infrastructure buildouts on the public cloud are complex, time-consuming and may involve substantial expenditures. In addition, the implementation of public cloud-based data centers involves risks, including loss of information and potential disruption to SoundHound’s normal operations. Deficiencies in the design, implementation or maintenance of the cloud-based data centers could materially harm SoundHound’s business.
As SoundHound considers approaches for expanding internationally, government regulation protecting the non-discriminatory provision of internet access may be nascent or non-existent. In those markets where regulatory safeguards against unreasonable discrimination are nascent or non-existent and where local network operators possess substantial market power, SoundHound could experience anti-competitive practices that could impede its growth, cause it to incur additional expenses or otherwise harm its business. Future regulations or changes in laws and regulations or their existing interpretations or applications could also hinder SoundHound’s operational flexibility, raise compliance costs and result in additional liabilities for SoundHound, which may harm its business.
Sales to customers outside the United States or customers with international operations and SoundHound’s international sales efforts and operations expose it to risks inherent in international sales and operations.
An element of SoundHound’s growth strategy is to expand its international sales efforts and develop a worldwide customer base. SoundHound’s international expansion may not be successful and may not produce the return on investment it expects.
SoundHound’s international subsidiaries employ workers primarily in Canada, Germany, France and India. Operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and subjects it to intellectual property,

Table of Contents
regulatory, economic and political risks that are different from those in the United States. As SoundHound increases its international sales efforts it will face risks in doing business internationally that could harm its business, including:
•
the need to establish and protect SoundHound’s brand in international markets;
•
the need to localize and adapt SoundHound’s products for specific countries, including translation into foreign languages and associated costs and expenses;
•
difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, particularly hiring and training qualified sales and service personnel;
•
the need to implement and offer customer care in various languages;
•
different pricing environments, longer sales and accounts receivable payment cycles and collections issues;
•
weaker protection for intellectual property and other legal rights than in the U.S. and practical difficulties in enforcing intellectual property and other rights outside of the U.S.;
•
privacy and data protection laws and regulations that are complex, expensive to comply with and may require that customer data be stored and processed in a designated territory;
•
increased risk of piracy, counterfeiting and other misappropriation of SoundHound’s intellectual property in its locations outside the U.S.;
•
new and different sources of competition;
•
general economic conditions in international markets;
•
fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies, which may make SoundHound’s products more expensive in other countries or may increase its costs, impacting its operating results when translated into U.S. dollars;
•
compliance challenges related to the complexity of multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, telecommunications and telemarketing laws and regulations;
•
increased risk of international telecom fraud;
•
laws and business practices favoring local competitors;
•
compliance with laws and regulations applicable to foreign operations and cross border transactions, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws, supply chain restrictions, import and export control laws, tariffs, trade barriers, economic sanctions and other regulatory or contractual limitations on SoundHound’s ability to sell its products in certain foreign markets, and the risks and costs of non-compliance;
•
increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;
•
restrictions or taxes on the transfer of funds;
•
adverse tax consequences; and
•
unstable economic and political conditions and potential accompanying shifts in laws and regulations.
These risks could harm SoundHound’s international operations, increase its operating costs and hinder its ability to grow its international business and, consequently, its overall business and results of operations.
In addition, compliance with laws and regulations applicable to SoundHound’s international operations increases its cost of doing business outside the United States. SoundHound may be unable to keep current with changes in foreign 
22
Table of Contents
government requirements and laws as they change from time to time, which often occurs with minimal or no advance notice. Failure to comply with these regulations could harm its business. In many countries outside the United States, it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by SoundHound’s internal policies and procedures or United States or international regulations applicable to it. Although SoundHound has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and policies, there can be no assurance that all of its employees, contractors, strategic partners and agents will comply with these laws and policies. Violations of laws or key control policies by SoundHound’s employees, contractors, strategic partners or agents could result in delays in revenue recognition, financial reporting misstatements, fines, delays in filing financial reports required as a public company, penalties, or prohibitions on selling its products, any of which could harm its business.
Tax matters may cause significant variability in SoundHound’s operating results and may impact its overall financial condition.
SoundHound’s businesses are subject to income taxation in the United States, as well as in many tax jurisdictions throughout the world. Tax rates in these jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. If SoundHound’s effective tax rate increases, its operating results and cash flow could be adversely affected. SoundHound's effective income tax rate can vary significantly between periods due to a number of complex factors including:
•
projected levels of taxable income;
•
pre-tax income being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory rates or higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory rates;
•
increases or decreases to valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets;
•
tax audits conducted and settled by various tax authorities;
•
adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of income tax returns;
•
the ability to claim foreign tax credits;
•
the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings for which SoundHound has not previously provided for income taxes; and
•
changes in tax laws and their interpretations in countries in which SoundHound is subject to taxation.
SoundHound regularly evaluates the need for a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, considering historical profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. This analysis is heavily dependent upon SoundHound’s current and projected operating results. A decline in future operating results could provide substantial evidence that a full or partial valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is necessary. This could have a material adverse effect on SoundHound’s results of operations and financial condition.
Forecasts of SoundHound’s market and market growth may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the markets in which it competes achieve the forecasted growth, there can be no assurance that its business will grow at similar rates, or at all.
Growth forecasts described in this Annual Report relating to SoundHound’s market opportunities, including in the Voice AI market and adjacent markets, and the expected growth thereof, are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates which may prove to be inaccurate. Even if these markets meet its size estimate and experience the forecasted growth, it may not grow its business at a similar rate, or at all. Its growth is subject to many factors, including its success in implementing its business strategy and ability to penetrate adjacent markets, which is subject to many risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, the forecasts of market growth included in this Annual Report should not be taken as indicative of its future growth.

If SoundHound is unable to acquire new customers, its operating results will be harmed. Likewise, potential customer turnover in the future, or costs it incurs to retain its existing customers, could materially and adversely affect its operating results.
SoundHound’s success depends on its ability to acquire new customers in new and existing verticals, and in new and existing geographic markets. If SoundHound is unable to attract a sufficient number of new customers, it may be unable to reduce gross margins at desired rates and its operating results may suffer. The Voice AI market is competitive and many of SoundHound’s competitors have substantial financial, personnel and other resources that they utilize to develop solutions and attract customers. As a result, it may be difficult for us to add new customers to SoundHound’s existing customer base. Competition in the marketplace may also lead us to win fewer new customers or result in us providing discounts and other commercial incentives. Additional factors that impact SoundHound’s ability to acquire new customers include the perceived need for Voice AI -enabled products or Voice AI services, the size of prospective customers’ budgets for Voice AI, the utility and efficacy of SoundHound’s existing and new products, whether proven or perceived, and general economic conditions. These factors may have a meaningful negative impact on operating results.
If SoundHound does not successfully anticipate market needs, enhance its existing products, execute on delivering quality products and services, or develop new products and services that meet those needs on a timely basis, it may not be able to compete effectively and its ability to generate revenues will suffer.
SoundHound cannot guarantee that it will be able to anticipate future market needs and opportunities or be able to develop product and service enhancements or new products and services to meet such needs or opportunities in a timely manner, if at all. Even if SoundHound is able to anticipate, develop and commercially introduce enhancements and new products and services, there can be no assurance that enhancements or new products and services will achieve widespread market acceptance.
New products, as well as enhancements to its existing products, could fail to attain sufficient market acceptance for many reasons, including:
•
delays in releasing new products, or product enhancements;
•
failure to accurately predict market demand and to supply products that meet this demand in a timely fashion;
•
defects in its products, errors or failures of its products;
•
negative publicity or perceptions about the performance or effectiveness of products;
•
introduction or anticipated introduction of competing products or technologies by its competitors; and
•
installation, configuration or usage errors by its customers.
If SoundHound fails to anticipate market requirements or fail to develop and introduce product enhancements or new products to meet those needs in a timely manner, it could cause us to lose existing customers and prevent us from gaining new customers, which would significantly harm its business, financial condition and results of operations.
If SoundHound spends significant time and effort on research and development and is unable to generate an adequate return on its investment, its results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.
SoundHound’s business model is predicated, in part, on maintaining a customer base that will generate a recurring stream of revenues. If that recurring stream of revenues is not maintained or does not increase as expected, or if SoundHound’s business model changes as the industry evolves, its operating results may be adversely affected.
SoundHound’s business model is dependent, in part, on its ability to maintain and increase a customer base that generates recurring revenues. Existing and future customers of SoundHound’s products, technologies and systems may not purchase its subscriptions for its proprietary products or enter into service contracts with SoundHound at the same rate at which customers currently purchase those subscriptions or enter into service contracts with us. If SoundHound’s current and future customers purchase a lower volume of subscriptions for SoundHound’s proprietary products or do not continue entering into service contracts with us, SoundHound’s recurring revenue stream relative to its total revenues would be reduced and its operating results would be adversely affected.

SoundHound’s brand, reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve its customers are dependent in part upon the reliable performance of its products and technologies. If SoundHound is unable to maintain and enhance its brand or reputation as an industry leader, its operating results may be adversely affected.
SoundHound’s brand, reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve its customers are dependent in part upon the reliable performance of, and the ability of its existing customers and new customers to access and use, its solutions, including real-time analytics and intelligence.
Interruptions in SoundHound’s systems or the third-party systems on which SoundHound and its products rely, whether due to system failures, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or other factors, could affect the security or availability of our products, network infrastructure, cloud infrastructure and website.
Problems with the reliability or security of SoundHound’s systems could harm its reputation. Damage to SoundHound’s reputation and the cost of remedying these problems could negatively affect its business, financial condition, and operating results. Additionally, SoundHound’s third-party hosting suppliers in certain instances may have no obligations to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and certain of the agreements governing these relationships may be terminated by either party at any time. If SoundHound is unable to maintain, renew, or expand its agreements with these providers on commercially reasonable terms, it may experience costs or downtime as it transitions its operations.
Any disruptions or other performance problems with its products could harm SoundHound’s reputation and business and may damage its customers’ businesses. Interruptions in its service delivery might reduce SoundHound’s revenue, cause SoundHound to issue credits to customers, subject us to potential liability and cause customers not to renew their subscription purchases of its products, which eventually adversely affected SoundHound's operating results.
We may engage in future acquisitions or strategic transactions which may require us to seek additional financing or financial commitments, increase our expenses and/or present significant distractions to our management. 
In January 2024, we completed our acquisition of SYNQ3 and in August 2024, we completed our acquisition of Amelia and we continue to actively evaluate opportunities to grow and enhance our business and technologies. In the event we engage in an acquisition or other strategic transaction, including by making an investment in another company, we may need to acquire additional financing. Obtaining financing through the issuance or sale of additional equity and/or debt securities, if possible, may not be at favorable terms and may result in additional dilution to our current stockholders. Additionally, any such transaction may require us to incur non-recurring or other charges, may increase our near and long-term expenditures and may pose significant integration challenges or disrupt our management or business, which could adversely affect our operations and financial results. For example, an acquisition or strategic transaction, may entail numerous operational and financial risks, including the risks outlined above and additionally:
•
exposure to unknown financial or product liabilities;
•
disruption of our business and diversion of our management's time and attention in order to develop acquired products or technologies;
•
higher than expected acquisition and integration costs;
•
write-downs of assets or goodwill or impairment charges;
•
increased amortization expenses;
•
difficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel which may result in reorganizations and reductions in force;
•
impairment of relationships with key suppliers or customers of any acquired businesses due to changes in management and ownership; and
•
inability to retain key employees of any acquired businesses.
25
Table of Contents
Accordingly, although there can be no assurance that we will undertake or successfully complete any transactions of the nature described above, any transactions that we do complete could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
If intangible assets and goodwill that we recorded in connection with our acquisitions, including our SYNQ3 and Amelia acquisitions, become impaired, we may have to take significant charges against earnings, which would have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
We record goodwill and intangible assets at fair value upon the acquisition of a business. Goodwill represents the excess of amounts paid for acquiring businesses over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, we must assess, at least annually and potentially more frequently, whether the value of indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill have been impaired. Intangible assets and goodwill will be assessed for impairment in the event of an impairment indicator. Any reduction or impairment of the value of intangible assets and goodwill will result in a charge against earnings, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and shareholders’ equity in future periods.
Our acquisitions expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, and we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of acquisitions of businesses or technologies. 
As a part of our growth strategy, we have made and may continue to make selected acquisitions of complementary products and/or businesses. Any acquisition involves numerous risks and operational, financial, and managerial challenges, including the following, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations:
•
difficulties in integrating new operations, technologies, products, and personnel;
•
problems maintaining uniform procedures, controls and policies with respect to our financial accounting systems;
•
lack of synergies or the inability to realize expected synergies and cost-savings;
•
difficulties in managing geographically dispersed operations, including risks associated with entering foreign markets in which we have no or limited prior experience;
•
underperformance of any acquired technology, product, or business relative to our expectations and the price we paid;
•
negative near-term impacts on financial results after an acquisition, including acquisition-related earnings charges and contingent acquisition liabilities related to earnout payments or otherwise;
•
the potential loss of key employees, customers, and strategic partners of acquired companies;
•
claims by terminated employees and shareholders of acquired companies or other third parties related to the transaction;
•
the assumption or incurrence of additional debt obligations or expenses, or use of substantial portions of our cash;
•
the issuance of equity securities to finance or as consideration for any acquisitions that dilute the ownership of our stockholders (which in the case of certain of our prior acquisitions were significant);
•
the issuance of equity securities to finance or as consideration for any acquisitions may not be an option if the price of our common stock is low or volatile which could preclude us from completing any such acquisitions;
•
diversion of management’s attention and company resources from existing operations of the business;
•
inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, and policies;
•
the impairment of intangible assets as a result of technological advancements, or worse-than-expected performance of acquired companies;
26
Table of Contents
•
assumption of, or exposure to, historical liabilities of the acquired business, including unknown contingent or similar liabilities, including product liability, that are difficult to identify or accurately quantify; and
•
risks associated with acquiring intellectual property, including potential disputes regarding acquired companies’ intellectual property.
In addition, the successful integration of acquired businesses requires significant efforts and expense across all operational areas, including sales and marketing, research and development, finance, legal, and information technologies. There can be no assurance that any of the acquisitions we may make will be successful or will be, or will remain, profitable or accretive. Our failure to successfully address the foregoing risks may prevent us from achieving the anticipated benefits from any acquisition in a reasonable time frame, or at all.
The integration of our acquisitions, and in particular, our acquisition of SYNQ3 and Amelia, may result in significant accounting charges that adversely affect the financial results of our company. 
The financial results of our company may be adversely affected by cash expenses and non-cash accounting charges incurred in connection with our acquisitions. In addition to the anticipated cash charges, costs associated with the amortization of intangible assets are expected. The price of our common stock could decline to the extent our financial results are materially affected by the foregoing charges or if the foregoing charges are larger than anticipated.
Our acquisitions may result in unexpected consequences to our business and results of operations. 
Although we believe that our recently acquired businesses will generally be subject to risks similar to those to which we are subject to in our existing operations, we may not have discovered all risks applicable to these businesses during the due diligence process. Some of these risks could produce unexpected and unwanted consequences for us. Undiscovered risks may result in us incurring financial liabilities, which could be material and have a negative impact on our business operations.
Failure to realize the benefits expected from our recent acquisitions could adversely affect the value of our common stock.
The success of our recent acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to:
•
integrate SYNQ3’s and Amelia's customer bases and capitalize on our cross-selling opportunities;
•
realize cost savings from reduced back-office and infrastructure expenses, eliminate duplicative company and management structure costs;
•
operate our combined businesses efficiently, achieve the strategic operating objectives for our business and realize significant cost savings and synergies;
•
realize the attractive risk-adjusted equity returns from our acquisitions for our stockholders; and
•
capitalize on the embedded and/or underexploited expansion opportunities offered by our acquisitions that we can expand upon.
However, to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions we must successfully integrate their businesses in a manner that permits those benefits and cost savings to be realized. Although we expect benefits to result from these acquisitions, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully realize these benefits. The challenges involved in this integration will be complex and time consuming and may require a disproportionate amount of resources and management attention and could result in the loss of valuable employees, the disruption of each company’s ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices, and policies that could adversely impact our operations. If we do not successfully manage these and related issues and challenges, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions and our revenue, expenses, operating results, financial condition and stock price could be materially adversely affected.
SoundHound has generated substantial net losses and negative operating cash flows since its inception and may continue to do so for the foreseeable future.
27
Table of Contents
To date, SoundHound has generated substantial net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities. SoundHound may continue to have net losses and negative operating cash flows as SoundHound continues to invest in its development activities, and in sales and marketing. SoundHound also expects to incur the incremental costs of operating as a public company, contributing to SoundHound’s losses and operating uses of cash. SoundHound’s costs may also increase due to such factors as higher than anticipated financing and other costs; increases in the costs of labor or infrastructure, in particular following the implementation of the restructuring plan; and major incidents or catastrophic events. If any of these or similar factors occur, SoundHound’s net losses and accumulated deficit could increase significantly and the price of shares of its common stock could decline.
SoundHound may require additional capital to continue its planned business operations but may not be able to obtain such capital when desired on favorable terms, if at all, or without dilution to its stockholders.
Even though the total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents on hand as of December 31, 2024 was $198.2 million, SoundHound may require additional capital to continue its planned business operations. SoundHound anticipates that current cash, cash equivalents, cash provided by operating activities and funds available through SoundHound’s at-the-market offering program (ATM program), will not be sufficient to meet its future capital needs. SoundHound will need additional financing to execute on its current or future business strategies, including to:
•
potentially hire additional software engineers, sales and marketing professionals, and other personnel as needed following implementation of the restructuring plan;
•
develop new or enhance existing products and services;
•
enhance SoundHound’s operating infrastructure;
•
acquire complementary businesses or technologies; or
•
otherwise respond to competitive pressures.
If SoundHound raises additional funds through the issuance of equity, including its ATM Program, or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of its stockholders could be significantly diluted, and these newly-issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders, including those acquiring shares in this offering. SoundHound cannot assure you that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to SoundHound, or at all, particularly in light of inflationary pressures and resulting increases in the cost of borrowing. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, if and when needed, SoundHound’s ability to fund its operations, take advantage of unanticipated opportunities, develop or enhance its products, or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited.
The loss of one or more key members of SoundHound’s management team or personnel, or its failure to attract, integrate and retain additional personnel in the future, could harm its business and negatively affect its ability to successfully grow its business.
SoundHound is highly dependent upon the continued service and performance of the key members of SoundHound’s management team and other personnel. The loss of any of these individuals, each of whom is “at will” and may terminate his or her employment relationship with us at any time, could disrupt SoundHound’s operations and significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives.
Additionally, if any of SoundHound’s key management team members or other employees were to leave, SoundHound could face substantial difficulty in hiring qualified successors, particularly with consideration to our recent reduction in force related to our restructuring plan and could experience a loss in productivity while any successor obtains the necessary training and experience. Although SoundHound has arrangements with some of its executive officers designed to promote retention, its employment relationships are generally at-will and SoundHound has had key employees leave in the past. SoundHound cannot assure you that one or more key employees will not leave in the future. SoundHound intends to continue to hire additional highly qualified personnel, including research and development and operational personnel, as needed (with consideration to our restructuring plan) but may not be able to attract, assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future or may be required to pay increased compensation in order to do so. Any failure to attract, integrate, motivate and retain such employees could harm SoundHound’s business or impair our ability to timely meet business goals and objectives.

The Company has identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting and may identify additional material weaknesses in the future, which may result in material misstatements of the Company’s consolidated financial statements or cause the Company to fail to meet its periodic reporting obligations and the trading price of our stock could be negatively affected.
As a public company, we are required to comply with the SEC’s rules implementing Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which require management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.
Pursuant to SEC rules and regulations, our management is required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation. Annually, we perform activities that include reviewing, documenting and testing our internal control over financial reporting. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, we will not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting. Failure to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements and a failure to meet our reporting and financial obligations, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the trading price of our common stock. This could result in significant expenses to remediate any internal control deficiencies and lead to a decline in our stock price.
We identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The Company did not maintain an effective control environment as it lacked sufficient oversight of activities related to its internal control over financial reporting due to a lack of appropriate level of experience and training commensurate with its financial reporting requirements. Further, due to rapid business growth, changes to existing controls or the implementation of new controls have not been sufficient to respond to changes to the risks of material misstatement to financial reporting, which resulted in the Company, including the SYNQ3 and Amelia entities which were acquired during 2024, not designing and maintaining effective controls related to substantially all accounts and disclosures. These material weaknesses contributed to the following additional material weaknesses as of December 31, 2024:
•
The Company did not design and maintain effective controls related to the identification of and accounting for certain non-routine, unusual or complex transactions, including the accounting for complex financing transactions and acquisitions. 
•
The Company did not design and maintain effective controls to verify appropriate segregation of duties, including assessment of incompatible duties, identification of instances where incompatible duties were assigned to an individual, and addressing conflicts on a timely basis.
•
The Company did not design and maintain effective controls over certain information technology (IT) general controls over information systems that are relevant to the preparation of the Company’s financial statements. Specifically, the Company did not design and maintain: (i) user access controls to ensure appropriate segregation of duties and to adequately restrict user and privileged access to appropriate personnel; (ii) program change management controls to ensure that program and data changes are identified, tested, authorized and implemented appropriately; and (iii) computer operations controls to ensure that processing and transfer of data, and data backups and recovery are monitored. 
The material weaknesses related to the control environment, risk assessment and the accounting for certain non-routine, unusual or complex transactions resulted in the revision of the consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods ended September 30, 2022, December 31, 2022, March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023, immaterial errors related to SYNQ3 and Amelia acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2024 and immaterial errors in various accounts during the interim and annual periods during 2023 and 2024. The material weaknesses related to segregation of duties and IT general controls did not result in a misstatement to our annual or interim consolidated financial statements. Additionally, the material weaknesses could result in misstatements to substantially all of our accounts and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement of the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.
Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary to provide reliable financial reports and to assist in the effective prevention or detection of material misstatements due to error or fraud. Any inability to provide reliable financial 
29
Table of Contents
reports or prevent or detect material misstatements due to error or fraud could harm our business. We regularly review and update our internal control over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies. In addition, we are required under the rules and regulations of the SEC regarding compliance with SOX to report annually on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Any system of internal controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. 
While we are in the process of addressing our material weaknesses as disclosed herein, elements of our remediation plan can only be accomplished over time and we can offer no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects. Any failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely impact our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis. If our financial statements are not accurate, investors may not have a complete understanding of our operations or may lose confidence in our reported financial information. Likewise, if our financial statements are not filed on a timely basis as required by the SEC and The NASDAQ Stock Market, we could face severe consequences from those authorities. In either case, it could result in a material adverse effect on our business or have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. Further, if we fail to remedy these deficiencies (or any other future deficiencies) or maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny, civil or criminal penalties or shareholder litigation. We can give no assurance that the measures we have taken and plan to take in the future will remediate the material weaknesses identified or that any additional material weaknesses or restatements of our financial statements will not arise in the future due to a failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting or circumvention of those controls.
Further, in the future, if we cannot conclude that we have effective internal control over our financial reporting, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified opinion regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could lead to a decline in our stock price.
Natural disasters, health epidemics, or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, commerce and the global economy, and have a negative effect on our business and operations.
A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, wildfire, flood, hurricane or significant power outage or other similar events, such as infectious disease outbreaks or pandemic events, could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results, by impacting, among other things, the demand for our services, our ability to achieve or maintain profitability and our ability to raise additional capital in the future. Our corporate headquarters are located in the San Francisco Bay Area of California, a region known for seismic and wildfire activities. Customer data could be lost, significant recovery time could be required to resume operations and our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected in the event of a major natural disaster or catastrophic event. Although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers, could decrease demand for our services, and could cause us to incur substantial expense. Our insurance may not be sufficient to cover losses or additional expenses that we may sustain. In addition, the impacts of climate change on the global economy and our industry are rapidly evolving. We may be subject to increased regulations, reporting requirements, standards or expectations regarding the environmental impacts of our business.
Risks Relating to SoundHound’s Intellectual Property and Technology
SoundHound’s use of open source technology could impose limitations on its ability to commercialize its software.
SoundHound uses open source technology in some of its software and expect to continue to use open source technology in the future. Although we monitor its use of open source technology to avoid subjecting its software to conditions SoundHound does not intend, we may face allegations from others alleging ownership of, or seeking to enforce the terms of, an open source license, including by demanding release of the open source software, derivative works, or SoundHound’s proprietary source code that was developed using such technology. These allegations could also result in litigation. The terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by United States courts. There is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on SoundHound’s ability to commercialize its software. In such an event, we may be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue commercially offering its software, to make its proprietary code generally available in source code form, to re-engineer its software or to discontinue the sale of its software if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis, any of which could adversely affect SoundHound’s business and revenue.
30
Table of Contents
The use of open source technology could subject SoundHound to a number of other risks and challenges. Certain open source technology is subject to further development or modification by anyone. Others may develop such software to be competitive with or no longer useful by us. It is also possible for competitors to develop their own solutions using open source software, potentially reducing the demand for SoundHound’s software. If SoundHound is unable to successfully address these challenges, its operating results may be adversely affected, and its development costs may increase
.
Third parties have claimed in the past and may claim in the future that SoundHound is infringing their intellectual property, and we could be exposed to significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling SoundHound’s products or making its technologies available to its customers if such claims are successful.
SoundHound has been and in the future may be subject to claims and legal actions alleging that we or its customers may be infringing or contributing to the infringement of the intellectual property rights of others (though no material legal actions against SoundHound are currently pending). We may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of its technologies and products. If it appears necessary or desirable, we may seek licenses for these intellectual property rights. However, we may not be able to obtain licenses from some or all claimants, the terms of any offered licenses may not be acceptable to us, and we may not be able to resolve disputes without litigation. Any litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and could divert the attention of SoundHound’s management and key personnel from its business operations. Intellectual property disputes could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into royalty and licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms, prevent us from licensing certain of its products, cause severe disruptions to its operations or the markets in which we compete, or require us to satisfy indemnification commitments with its customers including contractual provisions under various arrangements. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of SoundHound’s confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. For example, during the course of this kind of litigation, confidential information may be inadvertently disclosed in the form of documents or testimony in connection with discovery requests, depositions or trial testimony. This disclosure could have a material adverse effect on SoundHound’s business and its financial results. Any of these could seriously harm SoundHound’s business.
Unauthorized use of SoundHound’s proprietary technology and intellectual property could adversely affect its business and results of operations.
SoundHound’s success and competitive position depend in large part on its ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property rights protecting its products and technologies. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect SoundHound’s intellectual property and proprietary rights. Unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or discover aspects of SoundHound’s products or to obtain, license, sell or otherwise use information that we regard as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of SoundHound’s products is difficult and we may not be able to protect its technology from unauthorized use. Additionally, SoundHound’s competitors may independently develop technologies that are substantially the same or superior to its technologies and that do not infringe its rights. In these cases, we would be unable to prevent its competitors from selling or licensing these similar or superior technologies. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect SoundHound’s proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Although the source code for SoundHound’s proprietary software is protected both as a trade secret and as a copyrighted work, litigation may be necessary to enforce its intellectual property rights, to protect its trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Litigation, regardless of the outcome, can be very expensive and can divert management’s efforts.
SoundHound’s software products may have bugs, which could result in delayed or lost revenue, expensive correction, liability to its customers and claims against us.
Complex software products such as SoundHound's may contain errors, defects or bugs. Defects in the solutions or products that we develop and sell to its customers could require expensive corrections and result in delayed or lost revenue, adverse customer reaction and negative publicity about us or SoundHound’s products and technologies. Customers who are not satisfied with any of SoundHound’s products may also bring claims against us for damages, which, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming to defend, and could result in costly litigation and payment of damages. Such claims could harm SoundHound’s reputation, financial results and competitive position.

We may be unable to respond quickly enough to changes in technology and technological risks and to develop its intellectual property into commercially viable products.
Changes in legislative, regulatory or industry requirements or in competitive technologies may render certain of SoundHound’s products obsolete or less attractive to its customers, which could adversely affect its results of operations. SoundHound’s ability to anticipate changes in technology and regulatory standards and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis will be a significant factor in its ability to be competitive. There is a risk that we will not be able to achieve the technological advances that may be necessary for us to be competitive or that certain of its products will become obsolete. SoundHound is also subject to the risks generally associated with new product introductions and applications, including lack of market acceptance, delays in product development and failure of products to operate properly. These risks could have a material adverse effect on SoundHound’s business, results of operations and financial condition.
Risks Related to SoundHound’s Class A Common Stock and the Securities Market
SoundHound’s stock price and trading volume has fluctuated significantly and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future.
The market price and trading volume of SoundHound’s Class A Common Stock has fluctuated widely and may continue to fluctuate widely, depending on many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:
•
actual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations due to factors related to our business;
•
success or failure of our business strategies;
•
competition and industry capacity;
•
changes in interest rates and other factors that affect earnings and cash flow;
•
our level of indebtedness, our ability to make payments on or service our indebtedness and our ability to obtain financing as needed;
•
our ability to retain and recruit qualified personnel, particularly in light of our recent restructuring;
•
our quarterly or annual earnings or losses, or those of other companies in our industry;
•
announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions;
•
changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;
•
purchases or sales of our Class A Common Stock by large or influential investors or stockholders;
•
the failure of securities analysts to cover, or positively cover, our Class A Common Stock;
•
changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;
•
the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;
•
investor perception of the Company and the AI industry;
•
overall market fluctuations unrelated to our operating performance;
•
results from any material litigation or government investigation;
•
changes in laws and regulations (including tax laws and regulations) affecting our business;
•
changes in capital gains taxes and taxes on dividends affecting stockholders; and
32
Table of Contents
•
general economic conditions and other external factors.
Low trading volume for SoundHound’s Class A Common Stock would amplify the effect of the above factors on stock price volatility.
In addition, over the last few years, the stock market more broadly has experienced price and volume fluctuations, including due to factors relating to the outbreak of COVID-19, inflationary pressures, the wars in Ukraine and in Gaza and the imposition and/or threat of tariffs, and this volatility has sometimes been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result, there is a potential for rapid and substantial decreases in the price of our Class A Common Stock, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. This market and share price volatility relating to these outside effects, as well as general economic, market or political conditions, has and could further reduce the market price of our Class A Common Stock in spite of our operating performance and could also increase our cost of capital, which could prevent us from accessing debt and equity capital on terms acceptable to us or at all.
Additionally, a proportion of our Class A Common Stock may be traded by short sellers which may put pressure on the supply and demand for our Class A Common Stock, creating further price volatility. In particular, a possible “short squeeze” due to a sudden increase in demand of our Class A Common Stock that largely exceeds supply may lead to sudden extreme price volatility in our Class A Common Stock. Investors may purchase our Class A Common Stock to hedge existing exposure in our Class A Common Stock or to speculate on the price of our Class A Common Stock. Speculation on the price of our Class A Common Stock may involve long and short exposures. To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of Class A Common Stock available for purchase in the open market, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase our Class A Common Stock for delivery to lenders of our Class A Common Stock. Those repurchases may in turn, dramatically increase the price of our Class A Common Stock until investors with short exposure are able to purchase additional shares to cover their short position. This is often referred to as a “short squeeze.” Following such a short squeeze, once investors purchase the shares necessary to cover their short position, the price of our Class A Common Stock may rapidly decline. A short squeeze could lead to volatile price movements in our shares that are not directly correlated to the performance or prospects of our company and could cause purchasers of our Class A Common Stock to incur substantial losses.
Should the market price of our shares drop significantly, stockholders may institute securities class action lawsuits against us. A lawsuit against SoundHound could cause SoundHound to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of its management and other resources.
We do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future.
The timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to stockholders falls within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of our business and covenants associated with debt obligations, as well as legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. We do not intend to and there can be no assurance that we will pay any dividend in the future.
The requirements of being a public company may strain SoundHound’s resources and divert management’s attention, and the increases in legal, accounting and compliance expenses may be greater than SoundHound anticipates.
As a public company and a large accelerated filer, we will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that SoundHound did not incur as a private company. SoundHound is subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and is required to comply with the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as the rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC and the listing standards of the Nasdaq, including changes in corporate governance practices and the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls. Compliance with these rules and regulations can be burdensome. SoundHound’s management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased, and will continue to increase, SoundHound’s historical legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, SoundHound has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. SoundHound has hired and will continue to need to hire additional accounting and financial staff, including as a result of our acquisitions in 2024, and engage outside consultants, all with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge and maintain an internal audit function, which has and will increase its operating expenses. 
33
Table of Contents
Moreover, SoundHound could incur additional compensation costs in the event that it decides to pay cash compensation closer to that of other publicly listed companies, which would increase its general and administrative expenses and could materially and adversely affect its profitability. SoundHound will evaluate these rules and regulations, and cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs SoundHound may incur or the timing of such costs.
SoundHound may not have adequate personnel with the appropriate level of knowledge, experience and training in the accounting policies, practices or internal control over financial reporting required of public companies. SoundHound’s management will need to continually assess its staffing and training procedures to improve its internal control over financial reporting. For example, SoundHound did not timely file its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 and had to file extensions for its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 and 2023 Form 10-K. Unless the matters discussed in this risk factor and elsewhere in this Annual Report are mitigated, the risk exists that SoundHound may not be able to file timely in the future. Further, the development, implementation, documentation and assessment of appropriate processes, in addition to the need to remediate any potential deficiencies, will require substantial time and attention from management. The development and implementation of the standards and controls necessary for us to achieve the level of accounting standards required of a public company may require costs greater than expected. It is possible that SoundHound will be required to expand its employee base and hire additional employees to support its operations as a public company which will increase our operating costs in future periods.
Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including regulations implemented by the SEC and the Nasdaq, are subject to varying interpretations, and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. SoundHound intends to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If, notwithstanding our efforts, we fail to comply with new laws, regulations and standards, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us, and our business may be harmed.
Failure to comply with these rules might also make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events would also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, on committees of our board of directors or as members of senior management.
Risks Applicable to a Dual Class Common Stock Structure
SoundHound has a dual class common stock structure that has the effect of concentrating voting control with the holders of our Class B Common Stock. Our Class B Common Stock has multiple votes per share and this ownership will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transactions requiring stockholder approval, and that may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A Common stock.
SoundHound has a dual class common stock structure and the holders of SoundHound Class B Common Stock have ten votes per share. SoundHound Founders own shares of Class B Common Stock representing approximately 48% of the voting power of the outstanding capital stock of SoundHound as of December 31, 2024. In addition, because of the ten-to-one voting ratio between our Class B and Class A Common Stock, holders of our Class B Common Stock could continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our Common Stock and therefore control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval until such time, if any, as a sufficient number of shares of our Class B Common Stock are converted into shares of our Class A Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Second Amended & Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the "Amended Charter"). This concentrated control may limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets or other major corporate transactions requiring stockholder approval. In addition, this concentrated control may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our capital stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders. As a result, such concentrated control may adversely affect the market price of our Class A Common Stock.
Shares of Class B Common Stock are convertible into shares of Class A Common Stock and will automatically convert into shares of Class A Common Stock upon the occurrence of certain future events, generally including transfers, subject to limited excepts set forth in the Amended Charter. The conversion of Class B Common Stock to Class A 
34
Table of Contents
Common Stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B Common Stock who retain their shares in the long term. As a result, it is possible that one or more of the persons or entities holding our Class B Common Stock could gain significant voting control as other holders of Class B Common Stock sell or otherwise convert their shares into Class A Common Stock.
The Amended Charter provides for a dual-class multiple voting Common Stock structure, and we cannot predict the effect this structure of our Common Stock may have on the market price of our Class A Common Stock.
We cannot predict whether having an Amended Charter that permits the issuance of multiple voting shares in a dual-class structure will result in a lower or more volatile market price of our Class A Common Stock, adverse publicity or other adverse consequences. For example, certain index providers have announced and implemented restrictions on including companies with multiple-class share structures in certain of their indices. In July 2017, FTSE Russell announced that it would require new constituents of its indices to have greater than 5% of the company’s voting rights in the hands of public stockholders, and S&P Dow Jones announced that it would no longer admit companies with multiple-class share structures to certain of its indices. Affected indices include the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600, which together make up the S&P Composite 1500. Also in 2017, MSCI, a leading stock index provider, opened public consultations on its treatment of no-vote and multi-class structures and temporarily barred new multi-class listings from certain of its indices; however, in October 2018, MSCI announced its decision to include equity securities “with unequal voting structures” in its indices and to launch a new index that specifically includes voting rights in its eligibility criteria. Under such announced and implemented policies, the dual-class structure of our common stock would make us ineligible for inclusion in certain indices and, as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and other investment vehicles that attempt to passively track those indices would not invest in our Class A Common Stock. These policies are relatively new and it is unclear what effect, if any, they will have on the valuations of publicly-traded companies excluded from such indices, but it is possible that they may adversely affect valuations, as compared to similar companies that are included. Due to the dual-class structure of our common stock, we will likely be excluded from certain indices and we cannot assure you that other stock indices will not take similar actions. Given the sustained flow of investment funds into passive strategies that seek to track certain indices, exclusion from certain stock indices would likely preclude investment by many of these funds and could make our Class A Common stock less attractive to other investors. As a result, the market price of our Class A Common stock could be adversely affected.
Delaware law and provisions in our charter documents could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our common stock.
The Amended Charter, Amended & Restated Bylaws of the Company (the "Amended Bylaws"), and Delaware law contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control of SoundHound or changes in SoundHound that our management or stockholders may deem advantageous. Among other things, the Amended Charter and Amended Bylaws include the following provisions:
•
permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created directorships;
•
authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan;
•
eliminates the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders, except to the extent otherwise provided in the Amended Bylaws;
•
prohibit stockholder action by written consent, except to the extent otherwise provided in the Amended Bylaws, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;
•
provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter, or repeal our Amended Bylaws; and
•
establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.
These provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management. As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law. Pursuant to the Amended Charter, we have opted out of Section 203 of the DGCL, which prevents interested stockholders, such as certain 
35
Table of Contents
stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock, from engaging in certain business combinations unless (i) prior to the time such stockholder became an interested stockholder, our board of directors approved the transaction that resulted in such stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, (ii) upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in such stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of our common stock, or (iii) following board approval, such business combination receives the approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of our outstanding common stock not held by such interested stockholder at an annual or special meeting of stockholders. However, our Amended Charter includes provisions similar to the provisions contained in Section 203 of the DGCL, which are designed to limit SoundHound’s ability to enter into certain business combination transactions within a three (3) year period following the adoption of the Amended Charter.
Any provision of our Amended Charter, our Amended Bylaws, or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying, preventing, or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.
Risks Related to U.S. and International Taxation Generally
Changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect SoundHound’s future profitability.
Factors that could materially affect SoundHound’s future effective tax rates include but are not limited to:
•
changes in tax laws or the regulatory environment;
•
changes in accounting and tax standards or practices;
•
changes in the composition of operating income by tax jurisdiction; and
•
SoundHound’s operating results before taxes.
Because SoundHound does not have a long history of operating at its present scale and it has significant expansion plans, SoundHound’s effective tax rate may fluctuate in the future. Future effective tax rates could be affected by operating losses in jurisdictions where no tax benefit can be recorded under GAAP, changes in the composition of earnings in countries with differing tax rates, changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws.
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”), was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). In particular, sweeping changes were made to the U.S. taxation of foreign operations. Changes include, but are not limited to, a permanent reduction to the corporate income tax rate, limiting interest deductions, adopting elements of a territorial tax system, assessing a repatriation tax or “toll-charge” on undistributed earnings and profits of U.S.-owned foreign corporations, and introducing certain anti-base erosion provisions, including a new minimum tax on global intangible low-taxed income and base erosion and anti-abuse tax. The legislation has had no effect on SoundHound’s provision for income taxes because SoundHound has incurred annual losses in the U.S. to date and management set up a full valuation allowance against its U.S. federal and states deferred tax assets.
In addition to the impact of the Tax Act on SoundHound’s federal taxes, the Tax Act may impact its taxation in other jurisdictions, including with respect to state income taxes. State legislatures have not had sufficient time to respond to the Tax Act. Accordingly, there is uncertainty as to how the laws will apply in the various state jurisdictions. Additionally, other foreign governing bodies may enact changes to their tax laws that could result in changes to SoundHound’s global tax position and materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, the IRS and several foreign tax authorities have increasingly focused attention on intercompany transfer pricing with respect to sales of products and technologies and the use of intangibles. Tax authorities could disagree with SoundHound’s future intercompany charges, cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters and assess additional taxes. If SoundHound does not prevail in any such disagreements, its profitability may be affected.
SoundHound’s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.
As of December 31, 2024, SoundHound had $548.4 million of U.S. federal and $208.1 million of state net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will start to expire in 2025 and 2028, respectively, with the exception of $403.3 million federal net operating loss carryforwards and $11.0 million state net operating loss carryforwards, which can be carried forward indefinitely. It is possible that 
36
Table of Contents
SoundHound will not generate taxable income in time to use these net operating loss carryforwards before their expiration or at all. Under legislative changes made in December 2017, U.S. federal net operating losses incurred in 2018 and in future years may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such net operating losses is limited. In addition, the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and certain tax credits may be subject to significant limitations under Section 382 and Section 383 of the Code, respectively, and similar provisions of state law. Under those sections of the Code, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income or tax may be limited. In general, an “ownership change” will occur if there is a cumulative change in SoundHound’s ownership by “5-percent shareholders” that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. In addition, certain U.S. states have imposed additional limitations on the use of net operating loss carryforwards not otherwise imposed on the use of U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards and may impose additional limitations in the future.
Unanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
We are subject to income taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions, and our tax liabilities will be subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including:
•
changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;
•
expected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowances;
•
tax effects of stock-based compensation;
•
costs related to intercompany restructurings;
•
changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof; or
•
lower than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory tax rates.
In addition, we may be subject to audits of our income, sales and other transaction taxes by taxing authorities. Outcomes from these audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Item 1C. Cybersecurity
SoundHound acknowledges the increasing importance of cybersecurity in its operations and recognizes the potential risks and threats associated with cyber incidents. The Company is committed to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its information systems and data. However, no system can be completely immune to cyber threats. We face a number of cybersecurity risks in connection with our business. 
To date, such risks have not materially affected our business, including threats to and breaches of our data systems, malware and computer virus attacks.
Risk Management and Strategy
The following information provides an overview of our approach to managing cybersecurity risks. The Company assesses, identifies and manages cybersecurity related risks. Cybersecurity related risks are evaluated to assess top risks to the enterprise on a bi-annual basis. SoundHound has implemented a comprehensive cybersecurity program designed to identify, assess, and manage cyber risks.
This program includes, but is not limited to:
•
Regular risk assessments and vulnerability assessments.
•
Implementation of industry-accepted cybersecurity controls and best practices.
•
Employee training and awareness programs to enhance the company's overall cybersecurity posture.
•
Continuous monitoring and incident response plans to detect and mitigate potential threats promptly.
We have a set of Company-wide policies and procedures concerning cybersecurity matters, such as policies related to encryption standards, antivirus protection, remote access, multi factor authentication, confidential information and the use of the internet, social media, email and wireless devices. These policies go through an annual internal review process and are approved by appropriate members of management.
We have continued to expand investments in IT security, including additional end-user training, using layered defenses, identifying and protecting critical assets, strengthening monitoring and alerting, and engaging experts. We regularly test defenses by performing simulations and drills at both a technical level and by reviewing our operational policies and procedures. 
We review our operational policies and procedures with third party experts on an annual basis as part of our annual audit process.
 We also maintain cyber insurance coverage.
In addition to assessing our own cybersecurity preparedness, we also consider and evaluate cybersecurity risks associated with use of third-party service providers. Our Vendor Management Team conducts an annual review of third-party hosted applications with a specific focus on any sensitive data shared with third parties. The internal business owners of the hosted applications are required to document user access reviews at least annually and provide from the vendor a System and Organization Controls (SOC) 1 or SOC 2 report. If a third-party vendor is not able to provide a SOC 1 or SOC 2 report, we take additional steps to assess their cybersecurity preparedness and assess our relationship on that basis. Our assessment of risks associated with use of third-party providers is part of our overall cybersecurity risk management framework.
SoundHound will report any cybersecurity incidents determined to be material. Material aspects of the nature, scope and timing of the incident, and the impact or reasonably likely impact of the incident on the Company, including on SoundHound’s financial condition and results of operations will be disclosed.
Governance
The audit committee oversees risks from cybersecurity threats as part of its broader risk oversight responsibilities. The board recognizes the importance of cybersecurity in safeguarding the company’s assets and operations.
SoundHound has a dedicated Information Security Management committee responsible for overseeing risks from cybersecurity threats.
 The committee’s charter outlines its specific responsibilities related to cybersecurity risk oversight, and assists senior management in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities by creating, implementing, overseeing and maintaining SoundHound’s Information Security Management System. The purpose of the ISMS is to protect the Company’s information systems and assets, taking into account the potential for external threats, internal threats, and threats arising from transactions with trusted third parties and vendors. 
The board of directors is informed of cybersecurity risks, at least annually, through established processes, including periodic briefings, reports, and updates on the evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats.
