Business
Overview
Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company advancing disruptive solutions to improve patient experiences and outcomes for emerging and established therapies. 
As the innovators of ENHANZE
®
 drug delivery technology (“ENHANZE”) with our proprietary enzyme rHuPH20, our commercially validated solution is used to facilitate the subcutaneous (“SC”) delivery of injected drugs and fluids, with the goal of improving the patient experience with rapid SC delivery and reduced treatment burden. We license our technology to biopharmaceutical companies to collaboratively develop products that combine ENHANZE with our partners’ proprietary compounds. We also develop, manufacture and commercialize, for ourselves or with our partners, drug-device combination products using our advanced auto-injector technologies that are designed to provide commercial or functional advantages such as improved convenience, reliability and tolerability, and enhanced patient comfort and adherence.
Our ENHANZE partners’ approved products and product candidates are based on rHuPH20, our patented recombinant human hyaluronidase enzyme. rHuPH20 works by breaking down hyaluronan, a naturally occurring carbohydrate that is a major component of the extracellular matrix of the SC space. This temporarily reduces the barrier to bulk fluid flow allowing for improved and more rapid SC delivery of high dose, high volume injectable biologics, such as monoclonal antibodies and other large therapeutic molecules, as well as small molecules and fluids. We refer to the application of rHuPH20 to facilitate the delivery of other drugs or fluids as ENHANZE. We license our ENHANZE technology to form collaborations with biopharmaceutical companies that develop and/or market drugs requiring or benefiting from injection via the SC route of administration. In the development of proprietary intravenous (“IV”) drugs combined with our ENHANZE technology, data have been generated supporting the potential for ENHANZE to reduce patient treatment burden, as a result of shorter duration of SC administration with ENHANZE compared to IV administration. ENHANZE may enable fixed-dose SC dosing compared to weight-based dosing typically required for IV administration, extend the dosing interval for drugs that are already administered subcutaneously and potentially allow for lower rates of infusion-related reactions. ENHANZE may enable more flexible treatment options such as home administration by a healthcare professional or potentially the patient or caregiver. Lastly, certain proprietary drugs co-formulated with ENHANZE have been granted additional exclusivity, extending the patent life of the product beyond the patent expiry of the proprietary IV drug.
We currently have ENHANZE collaborations and licensing agreements with F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Ltd. and Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc. (“Roche”), Takeda Pharmaceuticals International AG and Baxalta US Inc. (“Takeda”), Pfizer Inc. (“Pfizer”), Janssen Biotech, Inc. (“Janssen”), AbbVie, Inc. (“AbbVie”), Eli Lilly and Company (“Lilly”), Bristol Myers Squibb Company (“BMS”), argenx BVBA (“argenx”), ViiV Healthcare (the global specialist HIV Company majority owned by GlaxoSmithKline) (“ViiV”), Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (“Chugai”) and Acumen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Acumen”). In addition to receiving upfront licensing fees from our ENHANZE collaborations, we are entitled to receive event and sales-based milestone payments, revenues from the sale of bulk rHuPH20 and royalties from commercial sales of approved partner products co-formulated with ENHANZE. We currently earn royalties from the sales of nine commercial products including sales of five commercial products from the Roche collaboration and one commercial product from each of the Takeda, Janssen, argenx and BMS collaborations.
We have commercialized auto-injector products with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd. (“Teva”) and Otter Pharmaceuticals, LLC (“Otter”). We have development programs including our auto-injectors with Idorsia Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (“Idorsia”).
Our commercial portfolio of proprietary products includes Hylenex

Our Technology
rHuPH20 can be applied as a drug delivery platform to increase dispersion and absorption of other injected drugs and fluids, potentially reducing treatment burden. For example, rHuPH20 has been used to convert drugs that must be delivered intravenously into SC injections or to reduce the number of SC injections needed for effective therapy. When ENHANZE technology is applied subcutaneously, the rHuPH20 acts locally and transiently, with a tissue half-life of less than 30 minutes. Hyaluronan at the local site reconstitutes its normal density within two days and, therefore, the effect of rHuPH20 on the architecture of the SC space is temporary. 
 The pressure-assisted auto-injector technology is a form of parenteral drug delivery that continues to gain acceptance and demand among the medical and patient community. Encompassing a variety of sizes and designs, our technology operates by using pressure to force the drug, in solution or suspension, through the skin and deposits the drug into the SC or intramuscular tissue. We have designed disposable, pressure-assisted auto-injector devices to address acute and chronic medical needs, such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, allergic reactions, testosterone deficiency. Our current platforms include the high-volume auto-injector, VIBEX
®
, VIBEX
®
 QuickShot
®
, and Vai™ auto-injectors and multi-dose pen injectors. Our current auto-injectors offer a dose capacity ranging from 0.5 mL to 2.25 mL, and our high-volume auto-injector technology extends that dose capacity to at least 10mL. They are designed for speed and patient comfort and accommodate for highly viscous drug products. They are customizable for fill volumes and needle lengths to meet our partners’ needs for reliability requirements, including for emergency use applications.
Our Strategy
We are a leader in converting IV biologics to SC delivery and extending the dosing interval of SC drugs, using our commercially-validated ENHANZE technology. Our ENHANZE technology also has the potential for SC delivery of small molecules and other therapeutic modalities including those developed as long-acting injectables and other therapies that might benefit from larger dose/larger volume SC delivery. We collaborate with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to help them develop products that combine our ENHANZE technology with their proprietary compounds. We target large, attractive markets, where ENHANZE-enabled SC delivery has the potential to deliver competitive differentiation and other important benefits to our partners, such as larger injection volumes administered rapidly, extended dosing intervals, and reduced treatment burden and healthcare costs. In addition, ENHANZE has been demonstrated to enable the combination of two therapeutic antibodies in a single injection, as well as the development of new co-formulation intellectual property. We leverage our strategic, technical, regulatory and alliance management skills in support of our partners’ efforts to develop new SC delivered products. We currently have eleven collaborations with nine currently approved products and additional product candidates in development using our ENHANZE technology. We intend to work with our existing partners to expand our collaborations to add new targets and develop targets and product candidates under the terms of the operative collaboration agreements. We will also continue our efforts to enter into new collaborations to derive additional revenue from our proprietary technology. 
We also support leading pharmaceutical companies by assisting in the development of, and supplying, auto-injector devices and auto-injector drug combination products. We leverage our engineering, regulatory and manufacturing skills to support our partners’ plans. We intend to extend the range of auto-injectors available to current and new partners. In 2023, we completed a successful Phase I clinical study using a high-volume auto-injector. It is our goal to further extend the number of partners for the current auto-injectors and add new partners for our high-volume auto-injector that utilizes our ENHANZE technology.

ATRS - 1902
We have an ongoing program to develop a proprietary drug device combination product for the endocrinology market, for patients who require additional supplemental hydrocortisone, identified as ATRS-1902. The development program uses a novel proprietary auto-injector platform to deliver a liquid stable formulation of hydrocortisone.
In June 2021, we submitted an investigational new drug (“IND”) application with the FDA for the initiation of a Phase 1 clinical study of ATRS-1902 for adrenal crisis rescue. The IND application included the protocol for an initial clinical study to compare the pharmacokinetic measures of our novel formulation of hydrocortisone versus Solu-Cortef
®
, which is an anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid and is the current standard of care for the management of acute adrenal crises.
In July 2021, the FDA accepted our IND for ATRS-1902 enabling us to initiate our Phase 1 clinical study. The Phase 1 clinical study, designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic measures of a liquid stable formulation of hydrocortisone, was initiated in September 2021. The study was a cross-over design to establish the pharmacokinetic measures of ATRS-1902 (100 mg) compared to Solu-Cortef (100 mg), the reference-listed drug, in 32 healthy adults. 
In January 2022, we announced the positive results from the Phase 1 clinical study and were granted Fast Track designation by the FDA. The positive results supported the advancement of our ATRS-1902 development program to a pivotal study for the treatment of acute adrenal insufficiency, using our Vai novel proprietary rescue pen platform to deliver a liquid stable formulation of hydrocortisone.

We are the exclusive supplier of the device, which we developed, for Teva’s generic Epinephrine Injection USP products, indicated for emergency treatment of severe allergic reactions including those that are life threatening (anaphylaxis) in adults and certain pediatric patients. Teva’s Epinephrine Injection, utilizing our patented VIBEX
®
 injection technology, was approved by the FDA as a generic drug product with an AB rating, meaning that it is therapeutically equivalent to the branded products EpiPen
®
 and EpiPen Jr
® 
and therefore, subject to state law, substitutable at the pharmacy.
In December 2007, we entered into a license, development and supply agreement with Teva under which we developed and supply a disposable pen injector for teriparatide. Under the agreement, we received an upfront payment and development milestones, and are entitled to receive royalties on net product sales by Teva in territories where commercialized.

We are the exclusive supplier of the multi-dose pen, which we developed, used in Teva’s generic teriparatide injection product. In 2020, Teva launched Teriparatide Injection, the generic version of Eli Lilly’s branded product Forsteo
®
 featuring our multi-dose pen platform, for commercial sale in several countries outside of the U.S. In November 2023, Teva announced FDA approval of the generic version of Forteo, featuring our multi-dose auto-injector pen platform for the treatment of osteoporosis among certain women and men.
Pfizer Agreement
In August 2018, we entered into a development agreement with Pfizer to jointly develop a combination drug device rescue pen utilizing the QuickShot auto-injector and an undisclosed Pfizer drug. Pfizer has provided the intellectual property rights for further development of the product to us and has retained an option to assist in the marketing, distribution and sale if we complete development of the product and submit for regulatory approval. We are continuing to evaluate the next steps for this program. 
Idorsia Agreement
In November 2019, we entered into a global agreement with Idorsia to develop a novel, drug-device product containing selatogrel. A new chemical entity, selatogrel is being developed for the treatment of a suspected acute myocardial infarction in adult patients with a history of acute myocardial infarction.
In August 2021, Idorsia initiated a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group Phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of self-administered SC selatogrel for prevention of all-cause death and treatment of acute myocardial infarction in subjects with a recent history of acute myocardial infarction.
Otter Agreement
In December 2021, we entered into a supply agreement with Otter to manufacture the VIBEX auto-injection system device, designed and developed to incorporate a pre-filled syringe for delivery of methotrexate, assemble, package, label and supply the final OTREXUP product and related samples to Otter at cost plus mark-up. Otter is responsible for manufacturing, formulation and testing of methotrexate and the corresponding pre-filled syringe for assembly with the device manufactured by us, along with the commercialization and distribution of OTREXUP. OTREXUP is a SC methotrexate injection for once weekly self-administration with an easy-to-use, single dose, disposable auto injector, indicated for adults with severe active rheumatoid arthritis, children with active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and adults with severe recalcitrant psoriasis. Further, we entered into a license agreement with Otter in which we granted Otter a worldwide, exclusive, fully paid-up license to certain patents relating to OTREXUP that may also relate to our other products for Otter to commercialize and otherwise exploit OTREXUP in the field as defined in the license agreement.
Patents and Intellectual Proprietary Rights
Patents and other intellectual proprietary rights are essential to our business. Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patent protection for our inventions, to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Our strategy is to actively pursue patent protection in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions for technology that we believe to be proprietary to us and that offers us a potential competitive advantage. 
Halozyme Patent Portfolio
Our Halozyme patent portfolio includes patents and pending applications that we own solely and, in some cases, jointly with several licensees in the U.S., Europe and other countries in the world. In general, patents have a term of 20 years from the application filing date or earlier claimed priority date. We continue to file and prosecute patent applications to strengthen and grow our patent portfolio pertaining to our recombinant human hyaluronidase and other drugs and drug delivery devices, which primarily cover compositions of matter, formulations, methods of use and manufacture, and devices. We have multiple patents and patent applications throughout the world pertaining to our recombinant human hyaluronidase and methods of use and manufacture, including an issued U.S. patent which expires in 2027, an issued European patent which expires in 2029, and additional patents that are valid into 2029, which we believe cover the products and product candidates under our existing collaborations and Hylenex recombinant. In addition, we have, under prosecution throughout the world, multiple patent applications that relate specifically to individual product candidates under development, and jointly owned patent applications relating to our collaborations with several licensees (including, but not limited to, patent applications covering co-formulations and methods of treatment or use that if granted will be valid into the 2040s), the expiration of which can only be definitely determined upon maturation into our issued patents. We believe our patent filings represent a barrier to entry for potential competitors looking to utilize these hyaluronidases, other drugs and drug delivery devices.

Other Proprietary Rights
In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how, regulatory exclusivities and continuing technological innovation to protect our products and technologies. We protect our trade secrets, proprietary know-how and innovation, in part, by maintaining physical security of our sites and electronic security of our information technology systems and utilizing confidentiality and proprietary information agreements. Our policy is to require our employees, directors, consultants, advisors, partners, outside scientific partners and sponsored researchers, other advisors and other individuals and entities to execute confidentiality agreements upon the start of employment, consulting or other contractual relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual or entity during the course of the relationship is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees and some other parties, the agreements provide that all discoveries and inventions conceived by the individual will be our exclusive property. In certain instances, partners with which we have entered into development agreements may have rights to certain technology developed in connection with such agreements. Despite the use of these agreements and our efforts to protect our intellectual property, there is a risk of unauthorized use or disclosure of information. Furthermore, our trade secrets may otherwise become known to, or underlying technology may be independently developed by, our competitors.
We also file trademark applications to protect the names of our products and product candidates. These applications may not mature to registration and may be challenged by third parties. We are pursuing trademark protection in a number of different countries around the world.
Research and Development Activities
Our research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the product development, quality and regulatory work required to maintain the ENHANZE platform, expenses associated with testing of new high-volume auto-injectors, activities and support for our partners in their development and manufacturing of product candidates performed on behalf of our partners, compensation and other expenses for research and development personnel, supplies and materials, facility costs and depreciation. We charge all research and development expenses to operations as they are incurred. 
Manufacturing
ENHANZE
We do not have our own manufacturing facility for our product and our partners’ products and product candidates, or the capability to package our products. We have engaged third parties to manufacture bulk rHuPH20 and Hylenex.
We have existing supply agreements with contract manufacturing organizations Avid Bioservices, Inc. (“Avid”) and Catalent Indiana LLC (“Catalent”) and Lonza Sales AG (“Lonza”) to produce supplies of bulk rHuPH20. Avid and Catalent currently produce and we anticipate Lonza will eventually produce bulk rHuPH20 under current Good Manufacturing Practices for clinical and commercial uses. Catalent currently produces bulk rHuPH20 for use in Hylenex and collaboration products and product candidates. Avid currently produces bulk rHuPH20 for use in collaboration products and product candidates. We rely on their ability to successfully manufacture these batches according to product specifications. It is important for our business for Catalent and Avid to (i) retain their status as current Good Manufacturing Practices-approved manufacturing facilities; (ii) successfully scale up bulk rHuPH20 production; and/or (iii) manufacture the bulk rHuPH20 required by us and our partners for use in our proprietary and collaboration products and product candidates. In addition to supply obligations, Avid and Catalent also provide support for data and information used in the chemistry, manufacturing and controls sections for FDA and other regulatory filings.
We have a commercial manufacturing and supply agreement with Patheon Manufacturing Services, LLC (“Patheon”) under which Patheon will provide the final fill and finishing steps in the production process of Hylenex recombinant. 
Devices
We also use third parties to manufacture our auto-injector technology products and product candidates, including the products and related components we supply to our partners. For our products and product candidates, we verify that they are manufactured in accordance with FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices for drug products and the FDA’s current Quality System Regulations for medical devices and equivalent provisions in the EU and elsewhere, which are required as part of the overall obligations necessary, in the EU for instance, to obtain a CE-mark. We enter into quality agreements with our third-party manufacturers which require compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, Quality System Regulations and foreign equivalents, to the extent applicable. We use third-party service providers to assemble and package our products and product candidates under our direction. We monitor and evaluate manufacturers and suppliers to assess compliance with regulatory requirements and our internal quality standards and benchmarks. We perform quality reviews of manufacturing for all of our product candidates and products, and quality releases for all of our product candidates and products that we sponsor or commercialize.

We sell XYOSTED and Hylenex recombinant in the U.S. to wholesale pharmaceutical distributors, who sell Hylenex to hospitals and XYOSTED to other end-user customers. We engage Integrated Commercialization Solutions, a division of AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group, a subsidiary of AmerisourceBergen, to act as our exclusive distributor for commercial shipment and distribution of Hylenex recombinant to our customers in the U.S. We also contract with numerous wholesale distributors, including Cardinal Health 105, Inc., also known as Specialty Pharmaceutical Services (“Cardinal”), McKesson Corporation and Cencora Inc. (formerly known as AmerisourceBergen Corporation) to distribute XYOSTED, to retail pharmacies as well as the Veterans Administration and other governmental agencies.
 In addition to shipping and distribution services, these distributors and third-party logistics providers Cardinal, and Knipper Health, Inc. (“Knipper”) provide us with other key services. Cardinal provides us with services related to logistics, warehousing, returns and inventory management, sales reports, contract administration, chargebacks processing and accounts receivable management. Knipper provides us with the same services except chargeback processing. We also use a division of Cardinal for sample administration. In addition, we utilize these third parties to perform various other services for us relating to regulatory monitoring. In exchange for these services, we pay fees to certain distributors based on a percentage of wholesale acquisition cost. We have also contracted with several specialty pharmacies to support fulfillment of certain prescriptions. In addition, we use third parties to perform various other services for us relating to regulatory monitoring, including adverse event reporting, safety database management and other product maintenance services.
Competition
The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary therapeutics. We face competition from a number of sources, some of which may target the same indications as our product or product candidates, including large pharmaceutical companies, smaller pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions, many of which have greater financial resources, drug development experience, sales and marketing capabilities, including larger, well established sales forces, manufacturing capabilities, experience in obtaining regulatory approvals for product candidates and other resources than us. 
ENHANZE
Our ENHANZE technology may face increasing competition from alternate approaches and/or emerging technologies to deliver medicines SC. In addition, our partners face competition in the commercialization of the product candidates for which the partners seek marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities.

Hylenex Recombinant
Hylenex recombinant is currently the only FDA-approved recombinant human hyaluronidase on the market. The competitors for Hylenex recombinant include Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s product, Amphadase
®
, a bovine (bull) hyaluronidase.
XYOSTED
In the U.S., there are several different formulations for testosterone replacement therapy including intramuscular injection, transdermal patches and gels, oral formulations and nasal gels. Potential competition in the U.S. testosterone replacement market includes transdermal solutions such as AbbVie’s Androgel
®
 1% and 1.62%, Perrigo’s generic Androgel
®
 Topical Gel 1.62%, Eli Lilly’s Axiron
®
, Endo’s Testim

 and Fortesta
®
 (and the authorized generic) and Verity Pharma’s TLANDO
® 
and Natesto
®
. Other forms of testosterone replacement therapy include injectables such as Endo’s Aveed®, Pfizer’s Depo®-Testosterone, and several generic oil testosterone products sold by Actavis, Sandoz, Viatris Inc., Teva and others, as well as Testopel
®
 pellets by Endo and JATENZO
®
, an oral formulation, by Tolmar, and Kyzatrex, an oral formulation by Marius Pharmaceuticals.
Devices
We have a wide range of competitors depending upon the branded or generic marketplace, the therapeutic product category, and the product type, including dosage strengths and route of administration. Our competitors include established specialty pharmaceutical companies, major brand name and generic manufacturers of pharmaceuticals such as Teva, Viatris, Eli Lilly and Endo, as well as a wide range of medical device companies that sell a single or limited number of competitive products or participate in only a specific market segment. Our competitors also include third party contract medical device design and development companies such as Scandinavian Health Ltd., Ypsomed AG, West Pharmaceutical and Owen Mumford Ltd. Many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have, such as more commercial resources, larger research and development staffs and more extensive marketing and manufacturing organizations. Smaller or early stage emerging companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies.
Government Regulations
The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in foreign countries regulate the manufacture and sale of the pharmaceutical products that we or our partners have developed or that our partners currently are developing. The FDA has established guidelines and safety standards that are applicable to the laboratory and preclinical evaluation and clinical investigation of therapeutic products and stringent regulations that govern the manufacture and sale of these products. The process of obtaining regulatory approval for a new therapeutic product usually requires a significant amount of time and substantial resources. 
Regulatory obligations continue post-approval and include the reporting of adverse events when a drug is utilized in the broader patient population. Promotion and marketing of drugs is also strictly regulated, with penalties imposed for violations of FDA regulations, the Lanham Act and other federal and state laws, including the federal anti-kickback statute.
We currently intend to continue to seek, through our partners, approval to market products and product candidates in foreign countries, which may have regulatory processes that differ materially from those of the FDA. Our partners may rely upon independent consultants to seek and gain approvals to market our proposed products in foreign countries or may rely on other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies to license our proposed products. We cannot guarantee that approvals to market any of our partners’ products can be obtained in any country. Approval to market a product in any one foreign country does not necessarily indicate that approval can be obtained in other countries.
From time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of drug products. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance may be revised or reinterpreted by the agency or reviewing courts in ways that may significantly affect our business and development of our partners’ product candidates and any products that we may commercialize. It is impossible to predict whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed, or what the impact of any such changes may be.

Human Capital Management
The experience, expertise and dedication of our employees drive the progress and accomplishments of Halozyme. 
As of February 11, 2025, we had 350 full-time employees. None of our employees are unionized and we believe our employee relations to be good. 
Recognizing the value of our employees and the contributions they make in achieving our business objectives and overall success, we focus on creating and providing an inclusive and safe work environment where employees are respected and rewarded for their contributions, work together as one team, have opportunities to grow and develop their careers, and support the communities in which we work. We also believe this approach to human capital management is essential to attracting and retaining employees in the highly competitive biotechnology and pharmaceutical labor market. To achieve this supportive working environment, our human capital management efforts focus on:
Corporate Values and Ethics
The foundation of our human capital management strategy is contained in our corporate values statement and our Code of Conduct and Ethics (the “Code of Conduct”), both of which provide uniform guidance to all our employees regarding expectations for proper workplace behavior. Our corporate values emphasize respecting and valuing fellow team members, innovation and acting with integrity and honesty to uphold the highest ethical standards. We believe these values provide an environment in which all employees can feel proud and motivated to contribute their valued talents to achieving corporate goals and objectives. Our values also emphasize empowering employees and personal accountability as a means to fulfill our commitments to patients, partners, shareholders and each other.
Our Board of Directors adopted and regularly reviews the Code of Conduct, which applies to all of our employees, officers and directors. Adherence to the Code of Conduct helps ensure that all employees can feel a part of an organization that emphasizes adherence to laws and policies covering the industry in which we work. Our Code of Conduct also emphasizes each employee’s accountability for making decisions and taking actions in a highly ethical manner with a focus on honesty, fairness and integrity and treating all fellow employees in a respectful and inclusive manner. We have established a reporting hotline that enables employees to file anonymous reports of any suspected violations of the Code of Conduct. We believe that providing an ethical environment in which to work is vital to our efforts to attract, retain and develop our employees.
Diversity and Inclusion
We seek to build and maintain a diverse team of employees that are passionate about and committed to having a positive impact on the lives of patients and their families. We value and celebrate the unique talents, backgrounds and perspectives each employee contributes to achieving our mission and corporate objectives. In support of this philosophy, we adopted the Biotechnology Innovation Organization’s principles on workforce development, diversity and inclusion. Our commitment to a diverse and inclusive culture is key to attracting, developing and retaining our talent pool within the globally competitive biotechnology industry. Our dedication to these principles has resulted in a diverse employee base consisting of 45% female and 32% non-white/Caucasian employees as of February 11, 2025.
As an equal opportunity employer, assuring we have and maintain an inclusive work environment is a key focus area for management. We actively seek to attract and retain employees who embody and embrace inclusivity as a core value. Our recruiting team collaborates with hiring managers to find the best possible candidates with appropriate knowledge, experience and technical skills. These candidates are then carefully vetted by a range of internal stakeholders as part of diverse interview panels. We evaluate our recruitment and retention efforts based on a variety of metrics, including offer acceptance rate, time-to-hire, turnover and diversity of our employees.
Our Elevate management development training includes a curriculum designed to equip leaders with skills to combat unconscious bias and foster a trusting, collaborative work environment.
Professional Development for Employees at All Levels
We are firmly committed to employee development as an essential driver of our future growth and overall success of Halozyme. We understand that high performing employees are always seeking a challenge and reaching for ways to broaden, deepen and develop their skills and grow professionally. To support our employees, we conduct an individual development plan process to give employees the opportunity and accountability to document their career goals and discuss the actions necessary to achieve those goals. We have three internal training programs: (i) our senior leader development program is focused on advancing business acumen and leadership skills, (ii) our Elevate management development program is focused on strengthening people management capabilities, and (iii) our learning and development curriculum for the entire organization is focused on personal, professional, team and leadership development opportunities and grounded in our established leadership attributes which identify the knowledge, skills, abilities and behaviors that contribute to individual and organizational performance. In addition, everyone attends or participates in compliance, harassment prevention, and safety training and we 
21
Table of 
Contents
offer education assistance for college and university courses, training seminars and educational conference attendance opportunities to all employees.
We underscore our commitment to professional development by allocating 16 hours of dedicated learning time per employee annually. During this time, employees have the autonomy to select from various learning modalities, from our instructor-facilitated offerings to digital platforms, to suit their individual learning preferences.
To monitor progress, we review our succession plan for key senior management positions as part of our annual talent review and identify development opportunities to help ensure potential successor readiness.
Employee Engagement
We place a high-level of emphasis on accountability and performance within our organization and consider employee engagement essential for success. To facilitate continuous improvement, we regularly conduct engagement surveys, with high participation rates indicating strong employee commitment. The feedback, including hundreds of constructive comments, is reviewed by senior leaders and informs targeted action plans to advance our company. Feedback received in the last survey resulted in enhanced leadership development training and cross-site collaboration improvements.
A key element in a successful company is effective and open communication. A transparent dialogue between employees and leadership is crucial for fostering an environment of performance and accountability. We take pride in our commitment to transparency, which is exemplified through our innovative approach to corporate communication. Our dedication to an open-door policy is highlighted by the opportunity for skip-level meetings with our Chief Executive Officer. These sessions invite employees to engage with top-tier leadership, ensuring they are well-versed in our mission and corporate priorities and have a platform to express insights and feedback.
To ensure that every voice is heard, we hold an all employee meeting at least monthly throughout the year. These meetings serve as an open forum to share progress on strategy and corporate goals as well as potential at-risk areas, celebrate achievements, and share best practices and learnings. These meetings also keep employees well-informed, connected and provide them with an additional venue to ask questions and discuss solutions.
Management tracks and assesses retention and attrition and interviews departing employees to identify any addressable trends.
Compensation & Benefits
Our compensation and benefits programs, with oversight from the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors, are designed to attract, retain and reward employees through competitive salaries, annual bonus eligibility, long-term incentive awards, an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, a 401(k) Plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, and employee assistance programs. Each year we conduct surveys to benchmark our salaries and benefits and confirm we are satisfied with the competitiveness of our total compensation offering. We also provide a variety of peer-to-peer and corporate recognition programs to celebrate and recognize our employees for their hard work and contributions.
Employee Health and Safety
We are committed to protecting the health and safety of our employees, visitors, clients, and the public. Health and safety practices are integrated into our business processes and align with our Corporate Environmental, Social, and Governance program philosophy and requirements. We maintain robust health and safety management systems and have established procedures that reduce the risk of injury and ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Continuous improvement is a key component of our health and safety efforts. We establish objectives and performance targets and periodically review results both with our internal safety committee as well as at the Executive and Board level to ensure our high standards are maintained. Our leadership team is active and engaged in supporting our health and safety program. Our employees are empowered and responsible for integrating health and safety into their daily work activities and we have experienced health and safety professionals on staff to guide these efforts.
Corporate Citizenship
At Halozyme, we value community engagement. We are committed to driving a positive impact within the communities where we live and work, and we provide our employees with multiple opportunities to contribute to the community, including providing company-wide community service days.
Our commitment to community activities is an important element of our culture and over the past several years we have actively supported organizations that are making strides in the following areas:
•
Advocacy and support for patients and healthcare;
•
Addressing and reducing health disparities;
