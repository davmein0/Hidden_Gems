Item 3.
Legal Proceedings
From time to time, we may be involved in disputes, including litigation, relating to claims arising out of operations in the normal course of our business. Any of these claims could subject us to costly legal expenses and, while we generally believe that we have adequate insurance to cover many different types of liabilities, our insurance carriers may deny coverage or our policy limits may be inadequate to fully satisfy any damage awards or settlements. If this were to happen, the payment of any such awards could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position. Additionally, any such claims, whether or not successful, could damage our reputation and business. We currently are not a party to any legal proceedings, the adverse outcome of which, in our opinion, individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
Market Information
Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “HALO.” As of February 11, 2025, we had approximately 136,528 stockholders of record and beneficial owners of our common stock.
Dividends
We have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain available cash for funding operations, stock repurchases and other capital initiatives; therefore, we do not expect to pay any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other factors, our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements, contract restrictions, business prospects and other factors our Board of Directors may deem relevant.
Purchase of Equity Securities by the Issuer
In December 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a capital return program to repurchase up to $750.0 million of our outstanding common stock over a three-year period which we completed in June 2024. A total of 19.1 million shares were repurchased over the three-year period at an average price per share of $39.31. All shares repurchased under our capital return programs have been retired and have resumed their status of authorized and unissued shares.
In February 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a new capital return program to repurchase up to $750.0 million of our outstanding common stock. In December 2024, we entered into an Accelerated Share Repurchase (“ASR”) agreement with
Bank of America to repurchase $250.0 million of our common stock. Pursuant to the agreement, at the inception of the ASR,
we paid $250.0 million to Bank of America and took initial delivery of 4.2 million shares, representing approximately 80 percent of the total shares that will be repurchased under the ASR agreement measured based on the closing price of our common stock on the transaction trade date. The final share count will be determined at the transaction settlement date. All shares repurchased under our capital return programs have been retired and have resumed their status of authorized and unissued shares.

 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks described in the Part I, Item 1A. Risks Factors, and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. References to “Notes” are Notes included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Overview
Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company advancing disruptive solutions to improve patient experiences and outcomes for emerging and established therapies. 
As the innovators of ENHANZE
®
 drug delivery technology (“ENHANZE”) with our proprietary enzyme rHuPH20, our commercially validated solution is used to facilitate the subcutaneous (“SC”) delivery of injected drugs and fluids, with the goal of improving the patient experience with rapid SC delivery and reduced treatment burden. We license our technology to biopharmaceutical companies to collaboratively develop products that combine ENHANZE

with our partners’ proprietary compounds. We also develop, manufacture and commercialize, for ourselves or with our partners, drug-device combination products using our advanced auto-injector technologies that are designed to provide commercial or functional advantages such as improved convenience, reliability and tolerability, and enhanced patient comfort and adherence.
Our ENHANZE partners’ approved products and product candidates are based on rHuPH20, our patented recombinant human hyaluronidase enzyme. rHuPH20 works by breaking down hyaluronan, a naturally occurring carbohydrate that is a major component of the extracellular matrix of the SC space. This temporarily reduces the barrier to bulk fluid flow allowing for improved and more rapid SC delivery of high dose, high volume injectable biologics, such as monoclonal antibodies and other large therapeutic molecules, as well as small molecules and fluids. We refer to the application of rHuPH20 to facilitate the delivery of other drugs or fluids as ENHANZE. We license our ENHANZE technology to form collaborations with biopharmaceutical companies that develop and/or market drugs requiring or benefiting from injection via the SC route of administration. In the development of proprietary intravenous (“IV”) drugs combined with our ENHANZE technology, data have been generated supporting the potential for ENHANZE to reduce patient treatment burden, as a result of shorter duration of SC administration with ENHANZE compared to IV administration. ENHANZE may enable fixed-dose SC dosing compared to weight-based dosing typically required for IV administration, extend the dosing interval for drugs that are already administered subcutaneously and potentially allow for lower rates of infusion-related reactions. ENHANZE may enable more flexible treatment options such as home administration by a healthcare professional or potentially the patient or caregiver. Lastly, certain proprietary drugs co-formulated with ENHANZE have been granted additional exclusivity, extending the patent life of the product beyond the patent expiry of the proprietary IV drug.
We currently have ENHANZE collaborations and licensing agreements with F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Ltd. and Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc. (“Roche”), Takeda Pharmaceuticals International AG and Baxalta US Inc. (“Takeda”), Pfizer Inc. (“Pfizer”), Janssen Biotech, Inc. (“Janssen”), AbbVie, Inc. (“AbbVie”), Eli Lilly and Company (“Lilly”), Bristol Myers Squibb Company (“BMS”), argenx BVBA (“argenx”), ViiV Healthcare (the global specialist HIV Company majority owned by GlaxoSmithKline) (“ViiV”), Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (“Chugai”) and Acumen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Acumen”). In addition to receiving upfront licensing fees from our ENHANZE collaborations, we are entitled to receive event and sales-based milestone payments, revenues from the sale of bulk rHuPH20 and royalties from commercial sales of approved partner products co-formulated with ENHANZE. We currently earn royalties from the sales of nine commercial products including sales of five commercial products from the Roche collaboration and one commercial product from each of the Takeda, Janssen, argenx and BMS collaborations.
We have commercialized auto-injector products with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd. (“Teva”) and Otter Pharmaceuticals, LLC (“Otter”). We have development programs including our auto-injectors with Idorsia Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (“Idorsia”).
Our commercial portfolio of proprietary products includes Hylenex
®
, utilizing rHuPH20, and XYOSTED
®
, utilizing our auto-injector technology.

The increase in royalties was primarily driven by continued sales uptake of DARZALEX SC by Janssen and Phesgo by Roche in all geographies, and the prior year launch of Vyvgart Hytrulo by argenx. We expect royalty revenue to further grow as a result of anticipated increasing partner product sales of DARZALEX SC and Phesgo, and sales of recently launched ENHANZE partner products, VYVGART Hytrulo, TECENTRIQ SC, OCREVUS SC and Opdivo Qvantig. We expect modest price erosion to continue on earlier launched ENHANZE partner products, Herceptin and MabThera.

Cost of Sales
 – 
Cost of sales consists primarily of raw materials, third-party manufacturing costs, fill and finish costs, freight costs, internal costs and manufacturing overhead associated with the production of our proprietary products, device partnered products and bulk rHuPH20. The decrease in cost of sales was primarily due to lower bulk rHuPH20 and device sales, partially offset by higher proprietary product sales. 
Amortization of intangibles
 –

Amortization of intangibles consists primarily of expense associated with the amortization of acquired device technologies and product rights. The decrease in amortization of intangibles expense was primarily due to an impairment charge of $2.5 million recognized in the prior year to fully impair the TLANDO product rights intangible asset.
Research and Development

–
 Research and development expenses consist of external costs, salaries and benefits, and allocation of facilities and other overhead expenses related to research manufacturing, preclinical and regulatory activities related to our collaborations, and our development platforms. The increase in research and development expense was primarily due to planned investments in ENHANZE related to the development of our new high-yield rHuPH20 manufacturing processes.
Selling, General and Administrative
 – Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive, selling and administrative functions, as well as professional fees for legal and accounting, business development, commercial operations support for proprietary products and alliance management, and marketing support for our collaborations. The increase in SG&A expense was primarily due to increased compensation expense and consulting and professional service fees, partially offset by planned reductions in commercial marketing expense.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
Our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale marketable securities. As of December 31, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $596.1 million. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. We expect to fund our operations going forward with existing cash resources, anticipated revenues from our existing collaborative agreements and cash that we may raise through future transactions. We may raise cash through any one of the following financing vehicles: (i) new collaborative agreements; (ii) expansions or revisions to existing collaborative relationships; (iii) private financings; (iv) other equity or debt financings; (v) monetizing assets; and/or (vi) the public offering of securities.
We may, in the future, draw on our existing line of credit or offer and sell additional equity, debt securities and warrants to purchase any of such securities, either individually or in units to raise capital for additional working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases, acquisitions or for other general corporate purposes. Our material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations.
Long-term debt
Our long-term debt consists of convertible notes. As of December 31, 2024, the aggregate principal amount of our convertible notes was $1,525.0 million. As of December 31, 2024, future interest payments associated with our convertible notes totaled $30.4 million, with $9.2 million payable within 12 months.
Leases
We have lease arrangements related to our office and research facilities and certain vehicles under non-cancelable operating leases. As of December 31, 2024, we have lease payment obligations of $37.4 million, with $7.1 million payable within 12 months.
Third-party manufacturing obligations
We have contracted with third-party manufacturers for the supply of bulk rHuPH20, fill/finish of Hylenex recombinant, other proprietary products and partnered products. Under these agreements, we are required to purchase certain quantities each year during the terms of the agreements. Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services include agreements that are enforceable and legally binding to us and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts disclosed were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee. As of December 31, 2024, we had third-party manufacturing obligations of $139.3 million, payable within 12 months.
Other purchase obligations and commitments
Purchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received the goods or services. As of December 31, 2024, we had other purchase obligations and other commitments of $26.5 million, with $24.3 million payable within 12 months.
The expected timing of payments of the obligations above is estimated based on information we have as of December 31, 2024. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.

Operating Activities
The increase in net cash provided by operations was primarily due to an increase in revenue, partially offset by higher working capital spend.
Investing Activities
The increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to an increase in net purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by a decrease in capital spend for property and equipment.
Financing Activities
The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to a decrease in share repurchase of common stock by $152.4 million and $13.5 million in cash paid on the conversion of our 2024 Convertible Notes in the prior year, partially offset by an increase in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our equity incentive plan.
Share Repurchases
In December 2021, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program to repurchase up to $750.0 million of our outstanding common stock which we completed in June 2024. In February 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a new capital return program to repurchase up to $750.0 million of our outstanding common stock. Refer to Part I, Item 8, Note 10,

Long-Term Debt
1.00% Convertible Notes due 2028
In August 2022, we completed the sale of $720.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2028 (the “2028 Convertible Notes” and collectively with the 2024 Convertible Notes and the 2027 Convertible Notes the “Convertible Notes”). The net proceeds in connection with the issuance of the 2028 Convertible Notes, after deducting the initial purchasers’ fee of $18.0 million, was approximately $702.0 million. We also incurred additional debt issuance costs totaling $1.0 million. Debt issuance costs and the initial purchasers’ fee are presented as a debt discount.
The 2028 Convertible Notes pay interest semi-annually in arrears on February 15th and August 15th of each year at an annual rate of 1.00%. The 2028 Convertible Notes are general unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to all indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2028 Convertible Notes, rank equally in right of payment 
55

with all existing and future liabilities that are not so subordinated, are effectively junior to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our current or future subsidiaries. The 2028 Convertible Notes have a maturity date of August 15, 2028.
Holders may convert their 2028 Convertible Notes at their option only in the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on December 31, 2022, if the last reported sale price per share of common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price for each of at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; (2) during the five consecutive business days immediately after any five consecutive trading day period (such five consecutive trading day period, the “measurement period”) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price per share of our common stock on such trading day and the conversion rate on such trading day; (3) upon the occurrence of certain corporate events or distributions on our common stock, as described in the offering memorandum for the 2028 Convertible Notes; (4) if we call such notes for redemption; and (5) at any time from, and including, February 15, 2028 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. As of December 31, 2024, the 2028 Convertible Notes were not convertible.
Upon conversion, we will pay cash for the settlement of principal, and for the premium, if applicable, we will pay cash, deliver shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our election. The initial conversion rate for the 2028 Convertible Notes is 17.8517 shares of common stock per $1,000 in principal amount of 2028 Convertible Notes, equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $56.02 per share of our common stock. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued or unpaid interest.
Capped Call Transactions
In connection with the offering of the 2028 Convertible Notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain counterparties (the “Capped Call Transactions”). The Capped Call Transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to holders of our common stock upon conversion of the 2028 Convertible Notes or at our election (subject to certain conditions) offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of such converted 2028 Convertible Notes. The cap price of the Capped Call Transactions is initially $75.4075 per share of common stock, representing a premium of 75% above the last reported sale price of $43.09 per share of common stock on August 15, 2022, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions. As of December 31, 2024, no capped calls had been exercised.
Pursuant to their terms, the capped calls qualify for classification within stockholders’ equity in our consolidated balance sheets, and their fair value is not remeasured and adjusted as long as they continue to qualify for stockholders’ equity classification. We paid approximately $69.1 million for the Capped Calls, including applicable transaction costs, which was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheets. The Capped Call Transactions are separate transactions entered into by us with the capped call Counterparties, are not part of the terms of the 2028 Convertible Notes, and do not affect any holder’s rights under the 2028 Convertible Notes. Holders of the 2028 Convertible Notes do not have any rights with respect to the Capped Call Transactions.
0.25% Convertible Notes due 2027
In March 2021, we completed the sale of $805.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 (the “2027 Convertible Notes”). The net proceeds in connection with the issuance of the 2027 Convertible Notes, after deducting the initial purchasers’ fee of $20.1 million, was approximately $784.9 million. We also incurred additional debt issuance costs totaling $0.4 million. Debt issuance costs and the initial purchasers’ fee are presented as a debt discount.
The 2027 Convertible Notes pay interest semi-annually in arrears on March 1st and September 1st of each year at an annual rate of 0.25%. The 2027 Convertible Notes are general unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to all indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2027 Convertible Notes, will rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future liabilities that are not so subordinated, are effectively junior to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our current or future subsidiaries. The 2027 Convertible Notes have a maturity date of March 1, 2027.
Holders may convert their 2027 Convertible Notes at their option only in the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on June 30, 2021, if the last reported sale price per share of common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price for each of at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; (2) during the five consecutive business days immediately after any five consecutive trading day period (such five consecutive trading day period, the “measurement period”) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement

period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price per share of our common stock on such trading day and the conversion rate on such trading day; (3) upon the occurrence of certain corporate events or distributions on our common stock, as described in the offering memorandum for the 2027 Convertible Notes; (4) if we call such notes for redemption; and (5) at any time from, and including, September 1, 2026 until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. As of December 31, 2024, the 2027 Convertible Notes were not convertible.
Upon conversion, we will pay cash for the settlement of principal, and for the premium, if applicable, we will pay cash, deliver shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our election. The initial conversion rate for the 2027 Convertible Notes is 12.9576 shares of common stock per $1,000 in principal amount of 2027 Convertible Notes, equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $77.17 per share of our common stock. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment.
1.25% Convertible Notes due 2024
In November 2019, we completed the sale of $460.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 (the “2024 Convertible Notes”). The net proceeds in connection with the issuance of the 2024 Convertible Notes, after deducting the initial purchasers’ fee of $12.7 million, was approximately $447.3 million. We also incurred debt issuance cost totaling $0.3 million. Debt issuance costs and the initial purchasers’ fee were presented as a debt discount.
In January 2021, we notified the note holders of our irrevocable election to settle the principal of the 2024 Convertible Notes in cash and for the premium, to deliver shares of common stock. The conversion rate for the 2024 Convertible Notes was 41.9208 shares of common stock per $1,000 in principal amount of 2024 Convertible Notes, equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $23.85 per share of our common stock. The conversion rate was subject to adjustment. 
In January 2023, we issued a notice for the redemption of 2024 Convertible Notes. Holders of the notes could convert their notes at any time prior to the close of the business day prior to the redemption date. In March 2023, holders of the notes elected to convert the 2024 Convertible Notes in full. In connection with the conversion, we paid approximately $13.5 million in cash which included principal and accrued interest, and issued 288,886 shares of our common stock representing the intrinsic value based on the contractual conversion rate.
Revolving Credit and Term Loan Facilities
In May 2022, we entered into a credit agreement, which was subsequently amended in August 2022 (the “Amendment”), with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and an L/C Issuer, and the other lenders and L/C Issuers party thereto (the “2022 Credit Agreement”), evidencing a credit facility (the “2022 Facility”) that provides for (i) a $575 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) and (ii) a $250 million term loan facility (the “Term Facility”). Concurrently, with the entry into the Amendment, we repaid the entire outstanding Term Loan Facility and repaid all outstanding loans under the Revolving Credit Facility under the 2022 Credit Agreement. The 2022 Facility will mature on November 30, 2026 unless either the Revolving Credit Facility or the Term Facility is extended prior to such date in accordance with the 2022 Credit Agreement.
The Term Facility requires quarterly scheduled repayments of the term loans in each of the first, second, third and fourth years following the closing in annual amounts equal to 2.50%, 5.00%, 7.50% and 10.00% of the initial principal amount of the term loans, respectively. The term loans are also subject to mandatory prepayments from the proceeds of certain asset sales, subject to our right to reinvest the proceeds thereof.
Borrowings under the 2022 Facility bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus: (a) the applicable Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) (which includes a SOFR adjustment of 0.10%), or (b) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, (2) the Bank of America prime rate, (3) the Term SOFR rate for an interest period of one month plus 1.10%, and (4) 1.00%. The margin for the 2022 Facility ranges, based on our consolidated total net leverage ratio, from 0.25% to 1.25% in the case of base rate loans and from 1.25% to 2.25% in the case of Term SOFR rate loans. In addition to paying interest on the outstanding principal under the 2022 Facility, we will pay (i) a commitment fee in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder and (ii) customary letter of credit fees and agency fees. The commitment fees range from 0.15% to 0.35% per annum based on our consolidated net leverage ratio.
 As of December 31, 2024, the revolving credit facility was undrawn.

Critical Accounting Estimates
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We review our estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our significant accounting policies are outlined in Part II, Item 8, Note 2, 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,
 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Revenue Recognition
Methodology
Judgment and Uncertainties
Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions
For collaborative agreements, we are entitled to receive event-based payments subject to the collaboration partner’s achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones. We recognize revenue when it is deemed probable that these milestones will be achieved, which could be in a period prior to its actual occurrence. At the end of each reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of achievement of such milestones, and if necessary, adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price.
Revenue is recognized when we determine it is probable a milestone will be achieved. This assessment is based on our past experience with our collaboration partners, market insight and partner communication. 
A revenue reversal will be required in the event it is determined that achievement of a milestone, previously deemed probable, will not occur. This reversal may be material. 
Royalty revenue is recognized in the period the underlying sales occur, but we do not receive final royalty reports from our collaboration partners until after we complete our financial statements for a prior quarter. Therefore, we recognize revenue based on estimates of the royalty earned, which are based on preliminary reports provided by our collaboration partners.
The amount of royalty revenue recognized for the quarter is estimated using our knowledge of past royalty payments, market insight and an estimate made by our collaboration partners provided in a preliminary report.
A final royalty report and associated royalty payment is received approximately 60 days after quarter-end. If necessary, a true-up is recorded at that time if there is a difference from the initial estimated royalty revenue recorded. To date, the true-up entries have not been material.
For collaborative arrangements, when necessary, we perform an allocation of the upfront amount based on relative standalone selling prices (“SSP”) of licenses for individual targets. We determine
license SSP using an income-based valuation approach utilizing risk-adjusted discounted cash flow projections of the estimated return a licensor would receive where applicable, or an alternative valuation method as indicative value from historical transactions.
The inputs used in the valuation model to determine SSP are based on estimates utilizing market data, information provided by our collaboration partners and data from historical transactions. 
Differences in the allocation of the transaction price between delivered and undelivered performance obligations can impact the timing of revenue recognition but do not change the total revenue recognized under any agreement.
Goodwill and Intangibles
Methodology
Judgment and Uncertainties
Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions
Goodwill and in-process research and development are not amortized; however, they are reviewed for impairment at least annually. We test for potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives annually in the second fiscal quarter or whenever indicators of impairment arise.
In the year of acquisition, significant estimates and assumptions are used to estimate the fair value of the intangible assets. Subsequent to the initial recognition, we monitor these assets for impairment indicators.
A change in any of the estimates or assumptions used may result an impairment charge in our consolidated statement of income.

Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
As of December 31, 2024, our cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted of investments in money market funds, asset-backed securities, U.S. Treasury securities, corporate debt securities and agency bonds. These investments were made in accordance with our investment policy which specifies the categories, allocations, and ratings of securities we may consider for investment. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive without significantly increasing risk. Some of the financial instruments that we invest in could be subject to market risk. This means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the value of the instruments to fluctuate. For example, if we purchase a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises, the value of that security may decline. Based on our current investment portfolio as of December 31, 2024, we do not believe that our results of operations would be materially impacted by an immediate change of 10% in interest rates. 
We hedge a portion of foreign currency exchange risk associated with forecasted royalties revenue denominated in Swiss francs to reduce the risk of our earnings and cash flows being adversely affected by fluctuations in exchange rates. These transactions are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. The cash flow hedges are carried at fair value with mark-to-market gains and losses recorded within AOCI in our consolidated balance sheets and reclassified to royalty revenue in our consolidated statements of income in the same period as the recognition of the underlying hedged transaction. We do not issue derivatives, derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. 
Further, we do not believe our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities have significant risk of default or illiquidity. We made this determination based on discussions with our investment advisors and a review of our holdings. While we believe our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities do not contain excessive risk, we cannot provide absolute assurance that in the future our investments will not be subject to adverse changes in market value. All of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are recorded at fair market value.

Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the timelines specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decision regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
There have been no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:
•
Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;
•
Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and
•
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework) (the “COSO criteria”). Based on our assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on the COSO criteria. The independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements that are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. The report appears below.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of 
Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria
.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and stockholders’ equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (2) and our report dated February 18, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of 
Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and stockholders’ equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 18, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Determination of Overall Transaction Price for Collaboration Agreements
Description of the Matter
At December 31, 2024, the Company has eleven collaboration agreements. As discussed in Notes 2 and 5 of the financial statements, amounts are included in the transaction price when management determines that it is probable that the amount will not result in a significant reversal of revenue in the future. During 2024, the Company recognized $
72.5
 million of variable consideration in the transaction price under their collaboration arrangements.
Auditing management’s conclusions related to determining the probability of achievement of milestones is complex and highly judgmental given the progression of developing and commercializing the combined targets is completed by the collaboration partners.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
We obtained an understanding and evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s process to routinely evaluate the probability of achievement of milestones and any related constraint for each collaboration, in addition to the controls over the completeness and accuracy of determining the population of agreements and potential milestone payments.
To test the milestone amounts included, or excluded, from the transaction price, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, inspecting evidence to support management’s assessment of the probability of achievement. For each milestone, we examined evidence including correspondence with the collaboration partner and evaluated management’s conclusions on the probabilities of achievement. We reviewed supporting documentation to corroborate that milestones were included in the transaction price when determined to be probable of achievement. We reviewed the collaboration agreements and related amendments to validate the completeness of the list of targets and potential milestone payments that management considered in their analysis. We performed a lookback analysis to validate the Company’s accuracy of determining the probability of achieving these milestones.

Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
1.    
Organization and Business 
Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company advancing disruptive solutions to improve patient experiences and outcomes for emerging and established therapies.
As the innovators of ENHANZE
®
 drug delivery technology (“ENHANZE”) with our proprietary enzyme, rHuPH20, our commercially validated solution is used to facilitate the subcutaneous (“SC”) delivery of injected drugs and fluids with the goal of improving the patient experience with rapid SC delivery and reduced treatment burden. We license our technology to biopharmaceutical companies to collaboratively develop products that combine ENHANZE with our partners’ proprietary compounds. We also develop, manufacture and commercialize, for ourselves or with our partners, drug-device combination products using our advanced auto-injector technologies that are designed to provide commercial or functional advantages such as improved convenience, reliability and tolerability, and enhanced patient comfort and adherence.
Our ENHANZE partners’ approved products and product candidates are based on rHuPH20, our patented recombinant human hyaluronidase enzyme. rHuPH20 works by breaking down hyaluronan, a naturally occurring carbohydrate that is a major component of the extracellular matrix of the SC space. This temporarily reduces the barrier to bulk fluid flow allowing for improved and more rapid SC delivery of high dose, high volume injectable biologics, such as monoclonal antibodies and other large therapeutic molecules, as well as small molecules and fluids. We refer to the application of rHuPH20 to facilitate the delivery of other drugs or fluids as ENHANZE. We license our ENHANZE technology to form collaborations with biopharmaceutical companies that develop and/or market drugs requiring or benefiting from injection via the SC route of administration. In the development of proprietary intravenous (“IV”) drugs combined with our ENHANZE technology, data have been generated supporting the potential for ENHANZE to reduce patient treatment burden, as a result of shorter duration of SC administration with ENHANZE compared to IV administration. ENHANZE may enable fixed-dose SC dosing compared to weight-based dosing typically required for IV administration, extend the dosing interval for drugs that are already administered subcutaneously and potentially allow for lower rates of infusion-related reactions. ENHANZE may enable more flexible treatment options such as home administration by a healthcare professional or potentially the patient or caregiver. Lastly, certain proprietary drugs co-formulated with ENHANZE have been granted additional exclusivity, extending the patent life of the product beyond the patent expiry of the proprietary IV drug.
We currently have ENHANZE collaborations and licensing agreements with F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Ltd. and Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc. (“Roche”), Takeda Pharmaceuticals International AG and Baxalta US Inc. (“Takeda”), Pfizer Inc. (“Pfizer”), Janssen Biotech, Inc. (“Janssen”), AbbVie, Inc. (“AbbVie”), Eli Lilly and Company (“Lilly”), Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (“BMS”), argenx BVBA (“argenx”), ViiV Healthcare (the global specialist HIV Company majority owned by GlaxoSmithKline) (“ViiV”), Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (“Chugai”) and Acumen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Acumen”). In addition to receiving upfront licensing fees from our ENHANZE collaborations, we are entitled to receive event and sales-based milestone payments, revenues from the sale of bulk rHuPH20 and royalties from commercial sales of approved partner products co-formulated with ENHANZE. We currently earn royalties from sales of 
nine
 commercial products including sales of 
five
 commercial products from the Roche collaboration and 
one
 commercial product from each of the Takeda, Janssen, argenx and BMS collaborations.
We have commercialized auto-injector products with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd. (“Teva”) and Otter Pharmaceuticals, LLC (“Otter”). We have development programs including our auto-injectors with Idorsia Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (“Idorsia”).
Our commercial portfolio of proprietary products includes Hylenex
®
, utilizing rHuPH20, and XYOSTED
®
, utilizing our auto-injector technology.
Except where specifically noted or the context otherwise requires, references to “Halozyme,” “the Company,” “we,” “our,” and “us” in these notes to consolidated financial statements refer to Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc. and each of its directly and indirectly wholly owned subsidiaries as disclosed in Note 2,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc. and our wholly owned subsidiaries, Halozyme, Inc. and Antares Pharma, Inc., and Antares Pharma, Inc.’s wholly owned Swiss subsidiaries, Antares Pharma IPL AG and Antares Pharma AG. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, which are based on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and, as such, actual results may differ from our estimates.
Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities
Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments, readily convertible to cash, which mature within 90 days or less from the date of purchase. As of December 31, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents consisted of money market funds, bank certificate of deposits and demand deposits at commercial banks.
Marketable securities are investments with original maturities of more than 90 days from the date of purchase that are specifically identified to fund current operations. Marketable securities are considered available-for-sale. These investments are classified as current assets, even though the stated maturity date may be one year or more beyond the current balance sheet date which reflects management’s intention to use the proceeds from the sale of these investments to fund our operations, as necessary. Such available-for-sale investments are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income and included as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. The cost of marketable securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts to maturity, and such amortization or accretion is included in investment and other income, net in our consolidated statements of income. We use the specific identification method for calculating realized gains and losses on marketable securities sold. None of the realized gains and losses and declines in value that were judged to be as a result of credit loss on marketable securities, if any, are included in investment and other income, net in our consolidated statements of income.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. 
Our financial instruments include cash equivalents, available-for-sale marketable securities, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and long-term debt. Fair value estimates of these instruments are made at a specific point in time based on relevant market information. These estimates may be subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore, cannot be determined with precision. The carrying amount of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses are generally considered to be representative of their respective fair values because of the short-term nature of those instruments.
Available-for-sale marketable securities consist of asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, U.S. Treasury securities, agency bonds and commercial paper, and are measured at fair value using Level 1 and Level 2 inputs. Level 2 financial instruments are valued using market prices on less active markets and proprietary pricing valuation models with observable inputs, including interest rates, yield curves, maturity dates, issue dates, settlement dates, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, issue spreads, benchmark securities or other market related data. We obtain the fair value of Level 2 investments from our investment manager, who obtains these fair values from a third-party pricing source. We validate the fair values of Level 2 financial instruments provided by our investment manager by comparing these fair values to a third-party pricing source.

Concentrations of Credit Risk, Sources of Supply and Significant Customers
We are subject to credit risk from our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities. These investments were made in accordance with our investment policy which specifies the categories, allocations, and ratings of securities we may consider for investment. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive without significantly increasing risk. We maintain our cash and cash equivalent balances with 
two
 major commercial banks and marketable securities with 
one
 other financial institution. Deposits held with the financial institutions exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. We are exposed to credit risk in the event of a default by the financial institutions holding our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities to the extent recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. 
We are also subject to credit risk from our accounts receivable related to our product sales and revenues under our license and collaborative agreements. We have license and collaborative agreements with pharmaceutical companies under which we receive payments for royalties, license fees, milestone payments for specific achievements designated in the collaborative agreements, reimbursements of research and development services, and supply of bulk formulation of rHuPH20 and auto-injector devices. In addition, we sell proprietary products in the United States (“U.S.”) to a limited number of established wholesale distributors in the pharmaceutical industry. Credit is extended based on an evaluation of the customer’s financial condition, and collateral is not required. Management monitors our exposure to accounts receivable by periodically evaluating the collectability of the accounts receivable based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due, the financial health of the customer and historical experience. Based upon the review of these factors, we recorded 
no
 significant allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Approximately 
60
% of the accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2024 represents amounts due from Janssen and Roche. Approximately 
69
% of the accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2023 represents amounts due from Janssen, Roche and Teva.

Accounts Receivable, net and Contract Assets
Accounts receivable is recorded at the invoiced amount and is non-interest bearing. Accounts receivable is recorded net of estimated prompt pay discounts, distribution fees and chargebacks. Contract assets are recorded when revenue is earned but an invoice has not been issued for payment. Contract assets relate to development milestones deemed probable of receipt for intellectual property licenses granted to partners in prior periods and for goods or services when control has transferred to the customer, and corresponding revenue is recognized but is not yet billable to the customer in accordance with the terms of the contract.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
Inventories
Inventories are stated at lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Inventories are reviewed periodically for potential excess, dated or obsolete status. We evaluate the carrying value of inventories on a regular basis, taking into account such factors as historical and anticipated future sales compared to quantities on hand, the price we expect to obtain for products in their respective markets compared with historical cost and the remaining shelf life of goods on hand.
Leases
We have entered into operating leases primarily for real estate and automobiles. These leases have contractual terms which range from 
three years
 to 
twelve years
. We determine if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. Right of use (“ROU”) assets and liabilities resulting from operating leases are included in property and equipment, accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the discount rate to calculate the present value of future payments. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred. Our leases often include options to extend or terminate the lease. These options are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Short-term leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For certain leases, such as automobiles, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.

Property and Equipment, Net
Property and equipment, including ROU assets are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life ranging from 
three years
 to 
ten years
 and leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term, whichever is shorter.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
We account for long-lived assets in accordance with authoritative guidance for impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. Long-lived assets are reviewed for events or changes in circumstances, which indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable.

Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity during the period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources.
Convertible Notes
The 2024 Convertible Notes, the 2027 Convertible Notes and the 2028 Convertible Notes (collectively, the “Convertible Notes”) are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidance for debt and derivatives. We evaluate all the embedded conversion options contained in the Convertible Notes to determine if there are embedded features that require bifurcation as a derivative as required by U.S. GAAP. Based on our analysis, we account for each of our Convertible Notes as single units of accounting, a liability, because we concluded that the conversion features do not require bifurcation as a derivative under embedded derivative authoritative guidance.
Cash Flow Hedges - Currency Risks
Beginning in the second quarter of 2023, we entered into a cash flow hedging program to mitigate foreign currency exchange risk associated with forecasted royalty revenue denominated in Swiss francs. Under the program, we can hedge these forecasted royalties up to a maximum of 
four years
 into the future. We hedge these cash flow exposures to reduce the risk of our earnings and cash flows being adversely affected by fluctuations in exchange rates.

Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
In accordance with the hedge accounting treatment, all hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedge and are highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions. Both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, we assess whether the foreign currency forward contracts are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items on a prospective and retrospective basis. If we determine a (i) foreign currency forward contract is not highly effective as a cash flow hedge, (ii) foreign currency forward contract has ceased to be a highly effective hedge or (iii) forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring, we would discontinue hedge accounting treatment prospectively. We measure effectiveness based on the change in fair value of the forward currency forward contract and the fair value of the hypothetical foreign currency forward contract with terms that match the critical terms of the risk being hedged. No portion of our foreign currency forward contracts were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. As of December 31, 2024, all hedges were determined to be highly effective. 
The assets or liabilities associated with our hedging contracts are recorded at fair market value in prepaid expense and other current assets, prepaid expenses and other assets, accrued expenses, or other long-term liabilities, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses related to changes in the fair market value of these hedging contracts are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”) within stockholder’s equity in our consolidated balance sheets and reclassified to royalty revenue in our consolidated statements of income in the same period as the recognition of the underlying hedged transaction. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, within the defined hedge period, we reclassify the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedge from AOCI to royalties revenue in our consolidated statements of income. Settlements from the cash flow hedge are included in operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. Since the fair market value of these hedging contracts is derived from current market rates, the hedging contracts are classified as derivative financial instruments. We do not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. As of December 31, 2024, amounts expected to be recognized as a net gain out of AOCI into our consolidated statements of income during the next 12 months are not material.
Business Combinations
Under the acquisition method of accounting, we allocate the fair value of the total consideration transferred to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. These valuations require us to make estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. We record the excess consideration over the aggregate fair value of tangible and intangible assets, net of liabilities assumed, as goodwill. Costs incurred to complete a business combination, such as legal and other professional fees, are expensed as incurred.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of a reporting period that falls within the measurement period, we report provisional amounts in our financial statements. During the measurement period, we adjust the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. We record these adjustments to the provisional amounts with a corresponding offset to goodwill. Any adjustments identified after the measurement period are recorded in our consolidated statements of income.
Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Asset
Assets acquired, including intangible assets and in-process research and development (“IPR&D”), and liabilities assumed are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date. Goodwill, which has an indefinite useful life, represents the excess of cost over fair value of the net assets acquired. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination that are used for IPR&D activities are considered indefinite lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts. Upon reaching the end of the relevant research and development project (i.e., upon commercialization), the IPR&D asset is amortized over its estimated useful life. If the relevant research and development project is abandoned, the IPR&D asset is expensed in the period of abandonment.
Goodwill and IPR&D are not amortized; however, they are reviewed for impairment at least annually during the second quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment. Goodwill and IPR&D are considered to be impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit or IPR&D asset exceeds its respective fair value.
We perform our goodwill impairment analysis at the reporting unit level, which aligns with our reporting and operating segment structure and availability of discrete financial information. During the goodwill impairment review, we assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, including goodwill. The qualitative factors include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, and our overall financial performance. If, after assessing the totality of these qualitative factors, we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than the carrying amounts, then no additional assessment is deemed necessary. Otherwise, we proceed to compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, we record an

impairment loss based on the difference. We may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment in a period and proceed to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test.
Our identifiable intangible assets with finite useful lives are typically comprised of acquired device technologies and product rights. The cost of identifiable intangible assets with finite lives is generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the assets’ respective estimated useful lives.
We perform regular reviews to determine if any event has occurred that may indicate intangible assets with finite useful lives and other long-lived assets are potentially impaired. If indicators of impairment exist, an impairment test is performed to assess the recoverability of the affected assets by determining whether the carrying amount of such assets exceeds the undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the affected assets are not recoverable, we estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss if the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value. Factors that may indicate potential impairment include a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization compared to the net book value, significant changes in the ability of a particular asset to generate positive cash flows for our strategic business objectives, and the pattern of utilization of a particular asset.
Revenue Recognition
We generate revenues from payments received (i) as royalties from licensing our ENHANZE technology and other royalty arrangements, (ii) under collaborative agreements and (iii) from sales of our proprietary and partnered products. We recognize revenue when we transfer promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for contracts with customers, we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligations.
ENHANZE and Device Royalties
Under the terms of our ENHANZE collaboration and license agreements, our partners will pay us royalties at an on average mid-single digit percent rate of their sales if products under the collaboration are commercialized. All amounts owed to us are noncancelable after the underlying triggering event occurs, and nonrefundable once paid. Unless terminated earlier in accordance with its terms, collaborations generally continue in effect until the last to expire royalty payment term, as determined on a product by product and country by country basis, with each royalty term starting on the first commercial sale of that product and ending the later of: (i) a specified period or term set forth in the agreement or (ii) expiration of the last to expire of the valid claims of our patents covering rHuPH20 or other specified patents developed under the collaboration which valid claim covers a product developed under the collaboration. In general, when there are no valid claims of a specified patent developed under the collaboration covering the product in a given country, the royalty rate is reduced for those sales in that country upon the expiration of our patents covering rHuPH20. Janssen’s patents covering DARZALEX SC do not impact the timing for this royalty reduction. Partners may terminate the agreement prior to expiration for any reason in its entirety or on a target-by-target basis generally upon 
90
 days prior written notice to us. Upon any such termination, the license granted to partners (in total or with respect to the terminated target, as applicable) will terminate provided; however, that in the event of expiration of the agreement (as opposed to a termination), the on-going licenses granted may become perpetual, non-exclusive and fully paid. Sales-based milestones and royalties are recognized in the period the underlying sales or milestones occur. We do not receive final royalty reports from our ENHANZE partners until after we complete our financial statements for a prior quarter. Therefore, we recognize revenue based on estimates of the royalty earned, which are based on internal estimates and available preliminary reports provided by our partners. We will record adjustments in the following quarter, if necessary, when final royalty reports are received. To date, we have not recorded any material adjustments.
We also earn royalties in connection with several of our licenses granted under license and development arrangements with our device partners. These royalties are based upon a percentage of commercial sales of partnered products with rates ranging from mid-single digits to low double digits and are tiered based on levels of net sales. These sales-based royalties, for which the license was deemed the predominant element to which the royalties relate, are estimated and recognized in the period in which the partners’ commercial sales occur. The royalties are generally reported and payable to us within 45 to 60 days after the end of the period in which the commercial sales are made. We base our estimates of royalties earned on actual sales information from our partners when available or estimated prescription sales from external sources and estimated net selling price. We will record adjustments in the following quarter, if necessary, when final royalty reports are received. To date, we have not recorded any material adjustments.

Revenue under ENHANZE and Device Collaborative Agreements
ENHANZE Collaboration and License Agreements
Under these agreements, we grant the collaboration partner a worldwide license to develop and commercialize products using our ENHANZE technology to combine our patented rHuPH20 enzyme with their proprietary biologics directed at up to a specified number of targets. Targets are usually licensed on an exclusive, global basis. Targets selected subsequent to inception of the arrangement generally require payment of an additional license fee. The collaboration partner is responsible for all development, manufacturing, clinical, regulatory, sales and marketing costs for any products developed under the agreement. We are responsible for supply of bulk rHuPH20 based on the collaboration partner’s purchase orders, and may also be separately engaged to perform research and development services. While these collaboration agreements are similar in that they originate from the same framework, each one is the result of an arms-length negotiation and thus may vary from one to the other.
We generally collect an upfront license payment from collaboration partners, and are also entitled to receive event-based payments subject to collaboration partners’ achievement of specified development, regulatory and sales-based milestones. In several agreements, collaboration partners pay us annual fees to maintain their exclusive license rights if they are unable to advance product development to specified stages. We earn separate fees for bulk rHuPH20 supplies and research and development services.
Although these agreements are in form identified as collaborative agreements, we concluded for accounting purposes they represent contracts with customers and are not subject to accounting literature on collaborative arrangements. This is because we grant to partners licenses to our intellectual property and provide supply of bulk rHuPH20 and research and development services which are all outputs of our ongoing activities, in exchange for respective consideration. Under these collaborative agreements, our partners lead development of assets, and we do not share in significant financial risks of their development or commercialization activities. Accordingly, we concluded our collaborative agreements are appropriately accounted for pursuant to U.S. GAAP. 
Under all of our ENHANZE collaborative agreements, we have identified licenses to use functional intellectual property as the only performance obligation. The intellectual property underlying the license is our proprietary ENHANZE technology which represents application of rHuPH20 to facilitate delivery of drugs. Each of the licenses grants the partners rights to use our intellectual property as it exists and is identified on the effective date of the license, because there is no ongoing development of the ENHANZE technology required. Therefore, we recognize revenue from licenses at the point when the license becomes effective and the partner has received access to our intellectual property, usually at the inception of the agreement.
When partners can select additional targets to add to the licenses granted, we consider these rights to be options. We evaluate whether such options contain material rights, i.e. have exercise prices that are discounted compared to what we would charge for a similar license to a new partner. The exercise price of these options includes a combination of the target selection fees, event-based milestone payments and royalties. When these amounts in aggregate are not offered at a discount that exceeds discounts available to other customers, we conclude the option does not contain a material right, and we consider grants of additional licensing rights upon option exercises to be separate contracts (target selection contracts).
Generally, we provide indemnification and protection of licensed intellectual property for our customers. These provisions are part of assurance that the licenses meet the agreements’ representations and are not obligations to provide goods or services.
We also fulfill purchase orders for supply of bulk rHuPH20 and perform research and development services pursuant to project authorization forms for our partners, which represent separate contracts. In addition to our licenses, we price our supply of bulk rHuPH20 and research and development services at our regular selling prices, called standalone selling prices (“SSP”). Therefore, our partners do not have material rights to order these items at prices not reflective of SSP. Refer to the discussion below regarding recognition of revenue for these separate contracts.
Transaction price for a contract represents the amount to which we are entitled in exchange for providing goods and services to the customer. Transaction price does not include amounts subject to uncertainties unless it is probable that there will be no significant reversal of revenue when the uncertainty is resolved. Apart from the upfront license payment (or target selection fees in the target selection contracts), all other fees we may earn under our collaborative agreements are subject to significant uncertainties of product development. Achievement of many of the event-based development and regulatory milestones may not be probable until such milestones are actually achieved. This generally relates to milestones such as obtaining marketing authorization approvals. With respect to other development milestones, e.g., dosing of a first patient in a clinical trial, achievement could be considered probable prior to its actual occurrence, based on the progress towards commencement of the trial. In order to evaluate progress towards commencement of a trial, we assess the status of activities leading up to our partner’s initiation of a trial such as feedback received from the applicable regulatory authorities, completion of investigational new drug or equivalent filings, readiness and availability of drug, readiness of study sites and our partner’s 
F-14

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
commitment of resources to the program. We do not include any amounts subject to uncertainties in the transaction price until it is probable that the amount will not result in a significant reversal of revenue in the future. At the end of each reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of achievement of such milestones and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price.
When target exchange rights are held by partners, and the amounts attributed to these rights are not refundable, they are included in the transaction price. However, they are recorded as deferred revenues because we have a potential performance obligation to provide a new target upon an exchange right being exercised. These amounts are recognized in revenue when the right of exchange expires or is exercised.
Because our agreements have one type of performance obligation (licenses) which are typically all transferred at the same time at agreement inception, allocation of transaction price often is not required. However, allocation is required when licenses for some of the individual targets are subject to rights of exchange, because revenue associated with these targets cannot be recognized. When allocation is needed, we perform an allocation of the upfront amount based on relative SSP of licenses for individual targets. We determine license SSP using an income-based valuation approach utilizing risk-adjusted discounted cash flow projections of the estimated return a licensor would receive where applicable, or an alternative valuation method such as indicative value from historical transactions. When amounts subject to uncertainties, such as milestones and royalties, are included in the transaction price, we attribute them to the specific individual target licenses which generate such milestone or royalty amounts.
We also estimate SSP of bulk rHuPH20 and research and development services, to determine that our partners do not have material rights to order them at discounted prices. For supplies of bulk rHuPH20, because we effectively act as a contract manufacturer to our partners, we estimate and charge SSP based on the typical contract manufacturer margins consistent with all of our partners. We determine SSP of research and development services based on a fully-burdened labor rate. Our rates are comparable to those we observe in other collaborative agreements. We also have a history of charging similar rates to all of our partners.
Upfront amounts allocated to licenses to individual targets are recognized as revenue when the license is transferred to the partner, as discussed above, if the license is not subject to exchange rights, or when the exchange right expires or is exercised. Development milestones and other fees are recognized in revenue when they are included in the transaction price, because by that time, we have already transferred the related license to the partner.
In contracts to provide research and development services, such services represent the only performance obligation. The fees are charged based on hours worked by our employees and the fixed contractual rate per hour, plus third-party pass-through costs, on a monthly basis. We recognize revenues as the related services are performed based on the amounts billed, as the partner consumes the benefit of research and development work simultaneously as we perform these services, and the amounts billed reflect the value of these services to the customer.
Device License, Development and Supply Arrangements
We have several license, development and supply arrangements with pharmaceutical partners, under which we grant a license to our device technology and provide research and development services that often involve multiple performance obligations and highly-customized deliverables. For such arrangements, we identify each of the promised goods and services within the contract and the distinct performance obligations at inception of the contract and allocate consideration to each performance obligation based on relative SSP, which is generally determined based on the expected cost plus mark-up. 
If the contract includes an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and performance obligations are satisfied over time, we recognize revenue over the development period using either the input or output method depending on which is most appropriate given the nature of the distinct deliverable. For other contracts that do not contain an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, revenue is recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer. Factors that may indicate transfer of control has occurred include the transfer of legal title, transfer of physical possession, the customer has obtained the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the assets, and we have a present right to payment. 
Our payment terms for development contracts may include an upfront payment equal to a percentage of the total contract value with the remaining portion to be billed upon completion and transfer of the individual deliverables or satisfaction of the individual performance obligations. We record a contract liability for cash received in advance of performance, which is presented as deferred revenue within accrued expense and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue in our consolidated statements of income when the associated performance obligations have been satisfied. 
License fees and milestones received in exchange for the grant of a license to our functional intellectual property, such as patented technology and know-how in connection with a partnered development arrangement, are generally recognized at

inception of the arrangement, or over the development period depending on the facts and circumstances, as the license is generally not distinct from the non-licensed goods or services to be provided under the contract. Milestone payments that are contingent upon the occurrence of future events are evaluated and recorded at the most likely amount, and to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur when the associated uncertainty is resolved.
Refer to Note 5, 
Revenue
, for further discussion on our collaborative arrangements.
Product Sales, Net
Proprietary Product Sales
Our commercial portfolio of proprietary products includes XYOSTED and Hylenex recombinant which we sell primarily to wholesale pharmaceutical distributors and specialty pharmacies, who sell the products to hospitals, retail chain drug stores and other end-user customers. Sales to wholesalers are made pursuant to purchase orders subject to the terms of a master agreement, and delivery of individual packages of products represents performance obligations under each purchase order. We use contract manufacturers to produce our proprietary products and third-party logistic vendors to process and fulfill orders
. 
We concluded we are the principal in the sales to wholesalers because we control access to services rendered by both vendors and direct their activities. We have no obligations to wholesalers to generate pull-through sales.
Revenue is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which is typically upon delivery, at the net selling price, which reflects the variable consideration for which reserves and sales allowances are established for estimated returns, wholesale distribution fees, prompt payment discounts, government rebates and chargebacks, plan rebate arrangements and patient discount and support programs. We recognize revenue from product sales and related cost of sales upon product delivery to the wholesaler location. At that time, the wholesalers take control of the product as they take title, bear the risk of loss of ownership, and have an enforceable obligation to pay us. They also have the ability to direct sales of product to their customers on terms and at prices they negotiate. Although wholesalers have product return rights, we do not believe they have a significant incentive to return the product to us.
The determination of certain reserves and sales allowances requires us to make a number of judgements and estimates to reflect our best estimate of the transaction price and the amount of consideration to which we believe we would be ultimately entitled to receive. The expected value is determined based on unit sales data, contractual terms with customers and third-party payers, historical and estimated future percentage of rebates incurred on sales, historical and future insurance plan billings, any new or anticipated changes in programs or regulations that would impact the amount of the actual rebates, customer purchasing patterns, product expiration dates and levels of inventory in the distribution channel. The estimated amounts of credit for product returns, chargebacks, distribution fees, prompt payment discounts, rebates and customer co-pay support programs are included in accrued expenses and accounts receivable, net in our consolidated balance sheets upon recognition of revenue from product sales. We monitor actual product returns, chargebacks, discounts and fees subsequent to the sale. If these amounts differ from our estimates, we make adjustments to these allowances, which are applied to increase or reduce product sales revenue and earnings in the period of adjustment.
Selling prices initially billed to wholesalers are subject to discounts for prompt payment and subsequent chargebacks when wholesalers sell our products at negotiated discounted prices to members of certain group purchasing organizations, pharmacy benefit managers and government programs. We also pay quarterly distribution fees to certain wholesalers for inventory reporting and chargeback processing, and to pharmacy benefit managers and group purchasing organizations as administrative fees for services and for access to their members. We concluded the benefits received in exchange for these fees are not distinct from our sales of our products, and accordingly we apply these amounts to reduce revenues. Wholesalers also have rights to return unsold product nearing or past the expiration date. Because of the shelf life of our products and our lengthy return period, there may be a significant period of time between when the product is shipped and when we issue credits on returned product.
We estimate the transaction price when we receive each purchase order taking into account the expected reductions of the selling price initially billed to the wholesaler arising from all of the above factors. We have compiled historical experience and data to estimate future returns and chargebacks of our products and the impact of the other discounts and fees we pay. When estimating these adjustments to the transaction price, we reduce it sufficiently to be able to assert that it is probable that there will be no significant reversal of revenue when the ultimate adjustment amounts are known.
Each purchase order contains only one type of product, and is usually shipped to the wholesaler in a single shipment. Therefore, allocation of the transaction price to individual packages is not required.
In connection with the orders placed by wholesalers, we incur costs such as commissions to our sales representatives. However, as revenue from product sales is recognized upon delivery to the wholesaler, which occurs shortly after we receive a purchase order, we do not capitalize these commissions and other costs, based on application of the practical expedient allowed within the applicable guidance.

Partnered Product Sales
Bulk rHuPH20

We sell bulk rHuPH20 to partners for use in research and development and, subsequent to receiving marketing approval, we sell it for use in collaboration commercial products. Sales are made pursuant to purchase orders subject to the terms of the collaborative agreement or a supply agreement, and delivery of units of bulk rHuPH20 represent performance obligations under each purchase order. We provide a standard warranty that the product conforms to specifications. We use contract manufacturers to produce bulk rHuPH20 and have concluded we are the principal in the sales to partners. The transaction price for each purchase order of bulk rHuPH20 is fixed based on the cost of production plus a contractual markup, and is not subject to adjustments. Allocation of the transaction price to individual quantities of the product is usually not required because each order contains only one type of product.
We recognize revenue from the sale of bulk rHuPH20 as product sales and related cost of sales upon transfer of title to our partners. At that time, the partners take control of the product, bear the risk of loss of ownership, and have an enforceable obligation to pay us.
Devices
We are party to several license, development, supply and distribution arrangements with pharmaceutical partners, under which we produce and are the exclusive supplier of certain products, devices and/or components. We recognize revenue from the sale of certain products, devices and/or components as product sales and related cost of sales at the point in time in which control is transferred to the customer, which is typically upon shipment of the goods to our partner. Sales terms and pricing are governed by the respective supply and distribution agreements, and there is generally no right of return. We provide a standard warranty that the product conforms to specifications. We use contract manufacturers to produce certain products, devices and/or components, and have concluded we are the principal in the sales to partners. Revenue is recognized at the transaction price, which includes the contractual per unit selling price. Allocation of the transaction price to individual quantities of the product is usually not required because each order contains only one type of product.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales consists primarily of raw materials, third-party manufacturing costs, fill and finish costs, freight costs, internal costs and manufacturing overhead associated with the production of proprietary and partnered products. Cost of sales also consists of the write-down of excess, dated and obsolete inventories and the write-off of inventories that do not meet certain product specifications, if any.

Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses include salaries and benefits, allocation of facilities and other overhead expenses, research related manufacturing services, contract services, and other outside expenses related to manufacturing, preclinical and regulatory activities and our partner development platforms. Research and development expenses are charged to operating expenses as incurred when these expenditures relate to our research and development efforts and have no alternative future uses.
We are obligated to make upfront payments upon execution of certain research and development agreements. Advance payments, including nonrefundable amounts, for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are deferred. Such amounts are recognized as expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed or such time when we do not expect the goods to be delivered or services to be performed.
Share-Based Compensation
We record compensation expense associated with stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance stock units (“PSUs”) and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) in accordance with the authoritative guidance for share-based compensation. The cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of an equity instrument is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. Share-based compensation expense for an award with a performance condition is recognized when the achievement of such performance condition is determined to be probable. If the outcome of such performance condition is not determined to be probable or is not met, no compensation expense is recognized and any previously recognized compensation expense is reversed. Forfeitures are recognized as a reduction of share-based compensation expense as they occur.

Income Taxes
We provide for income taxes using the liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases at each reporting period. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Significant judgment is required by management to determine our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any associated valuation allowances recorded against our net deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets (“DTA”) and other tax benefits are recorded when they are more likely than not to be realized. On a quarterly basis, we assess the need for valuation allowance on our DTAs, weighing all positive and negative evidence, to assess if it is more-likely-than-not that some or all our DTAs will be realized.

Segment Information
We generate revenues from payments received (i) as royalties from licensing our EHHANZE technology and other royalty arrangements, (ii) under collaborative agreements with our partners and (iii) from sales of our proprietary and partnered products. There are no intra-entity sales or transfers. We operate our business in 
one
 operating segment, which includes all activities related to the research, development and commercialization of our proprietary enzymes and devices. This operating segment also includes revenues and expenses related to (i) research and development and manufacturing activities conducted under our collaborative agreements with third parties, (ii) product sales of proprietary and partnered products, and (iii) associated selling, general and administrative expenses. 
The chief operating decision-maker (“CODM”), our Chief Executive Officer, reviews the operating results on an aggregate basis and manages the operations as a single operating segment. The CODM assesses the segment’s performance and decides how to allocate resources based on consolidated net income that is reported in our consolidated statements of income. The measure of segment assets is reported on the consolidated balance sheet as total consolidated assets. The significant expense categories regularly provided to the CODM include cost of sales, research and development, amortization of intangibles, and selling, general and administrative expenses. These expense categories are reported as separate line items in our consolidated statements of income.

Business Combination
On May 24, 2022, we acquired all outstanding equity interests of Antares Pharma, Inc. (“Antares”) according to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 12, 2022 (the “Merger Agreement”). Antares is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused primarily on the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products and technologies that address patient needs in targeted therapeutic areas. We acquired Antares as a part of our strategy to expand as a drug delivery company and include specialty products.
The total purchase consideration of Antares was $
1,045.7
 million. Each share of Antares common stock issued and outstanding was converted into the right to receive $
5.60
 in cash without interest, less any applicable withholding taxes (“Merger Consideration”). Additionally, in connection with the transaction, each Antares equity award granted and outstanding as of May 24, 2022 under the Antares’ equity compensation plans was converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration. Other components of purchase consideration include cash paid at closing to settle Antares’ existing debt of $
19.7
 million and seller transaction costs paid by us on behalf of Antares of $
22.9
 million. 
The acquisition of Antares was funded by cash on hand and borrowings under the new credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A. and other lenders that provided for (i) a $
350
 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) and (ii) a $
250
 million term loan facility (the “Term Facility”, collectively with the Revolving Credit Facility, the “2022 Facility”) as described in Note 8, 
Long-Term Debt, Net
. We recognized transaction costs of $
21.9
 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. These costs are reported in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income. Transaction costs include, but are not limited to, investment banker, advisory, legal, and other professional fees.
Purchase Consideration
The total purchase consideration was comprised of the following (in thousands):
Cash consideration for Antares shares outstanding as of May 24, 2022
$

Consideration for Antares equity compensation awards consists of $
32.2
 million paid for vested equity awards as well as $
13.6
 million paid for the pre-combination portion of unvested equity awards that were accelerated as part of the Merger Agreement. The fair value of the unvested equity awards attributable to the post-combination period of $
8.7
 million is included in our consolidated statements of income during the year ended December 31, 2022.
Fair Value of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed
The acquisition of Antares has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with authoritative guidance for business combinations, with Halozyme treated as the accounting acquirer, which requires, among other things, that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair value on the acquisition date.
The table below presents the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the acquisition date based on valuations and management estimates (in thousands). Fair value estimates are based on a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. 
The judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact our results of operations.

Goodwill
$
416,821

Goodwill is the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the expected revenue and cost synergies of the combined company and assembled workforce. Goodwill was allocated entirely to the single reportable unit. Goodwill recognized as a result of the acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes.
In the first six months of 2023, we recorded measurement period adjustments to increase accrued expenses by $
2.0
 million, increase deferred tax liabilities by $
5.5
 million and reduce accounts receivable by $
0.2
 million. The measurement period adjustments were recorded to reflect facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. During the second quarter of 2023, we finalized the estimates impacting the allocation of the purchase price consideration.
Identifiable Intangible Assets
The estimated fair values of identifiable intangible assets were prepared using the excess earnings method which calculates the present value of the incremental after-tax cash flows attributable solely to each intangible asset. The estimated useful lives are based on forecasted periods of benefit for each intangible asset which consider commercialization dates, the estimated revenue cycle based on the products’ competitiveness in the market, and the loss of exclusivity timing with subsequent trending down of revenue. For the ATRS-1902 IPR&D, the useful life is considered indefinite as the asset has not been placed into service. As such, the ATRS-1902 IPR&D will be tested annually for impairment and will not be amortized.

The unaudited pro forma financial information for all periods presented includes the business combination accounting effects resulting from this acquisition. The unaudited pro forma results include adjustments to reflect the amortization of the inventory step-up and the incremental intangible asset amortization to be incurred based on preliminary valuations of assets as well as certain material non-recurring transaction adjustments related to the acquisition. Adjustments to interest expense, financing costs and investment income were made to reflect the capital structure of the combined entity. Adjustments to income tax expense also were made to reflect the anticipated effective tax rate of the combined entity. The unaudited pro forma financial information as presented is for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of fiscal year 2021, nor is it necessarily an indication of trends in future results for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, differences between the assumptions used to prepare the pro forma information, cost savings from operating efficiencies, potential synergies, and the impact of incremental costs incurred in integrating the businesses.

Based on observable market transactions of spot currency rates, forward currency rates or equivalently-termed instruments. Carrying amounts of the financial assets and liabilities are equal to the fair value. As of December 31, 2024, the derivative assets recorded within prepaid expenses and other current assets and prepaid expenses and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets were $
2.4
 million
 and $
1.6
 million
, respectively. The derivative liabilities recorded within other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 were not material.
We had 
no
 available-for-sale securities that were classified within Level 3 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
A contingent liability was assumed as part of the Antares acquisition related to TLANDO. The acquisition date fair value was measured using the income approach, specifically the probability weighted expected return method for the development milestone payments and the option pricing methodology using the Monte Carlo simulation for commercial milestone payments and royalty payments. Estimates and assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation include forecasted revenues, cost of debt, risk free rate, weighted average cost of capital, revenue market price risk and revenue volatility. Estimates and assumptions used in the income approach include the probability of achieving certain milestones and a discount rate. These unobservable inputs represent a Level 3 measurement because they are supported by little or no market activity and reflect our own assumptions in measuring fair value. Changes in the fair value subsequent to the acquisition date is recognized in our consolidated statements of income. In September 2023, we provided Lipocine notice of termination of the TLANDO license agreement effective January 31, 2024. Based on the fair value remeasurement performed, we recognized a gain on change in fair value of the contingent liability of $
13.2
 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 in our consolidated statements of income.

Long-Term Debt, Net
1.00
% Convertible Notes due 2028
In August 2022, we completed the sale of $
720.0
 million in aggregate principal amount of 
1.00
% Convertible Senior Notes due 2028 (the “2028 Convertible Notes”). The net proceeds in connection with the issuance of the 2028 Convertible Notes, after deducting the initial purchasers’ fee of $
18.0
 million, was approximately $
702.0
 million. We also incurred additional debt issuance costs totaling $
1.0
 million. Debt issuance costs and the initial purchasers’ fee are presented as a debt discount.
The 2028 Convertible Notes pay interest semi-annually in arrears on February 15th and August 15th of each year at an annual rate of 
1.00
%. The 2028 Convertible Notes are general unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to all indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2028 Convertible Notes, rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future liabilities that are not so subordinated, are effectively junior to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, and are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our current or future subsidiaries. The 2028 Convertible Notes have a maturity date of August 15, 2028.
Holders may convert their 2028 Convertible Notes at their option only in the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on December 31, 2022, if the last reported sale price per share of common stock exceeds 
130
% of the conversion price for each of at least 
20
 trading days during the 
30
 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; (2) during the 
five
 consecutive business days immediately after any 
five
 consecutive trading day period (such 
five
 consecutive trading day period, the “measurement period”) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 
98
% of the product of the last reported sale price per share of our common stock on such trading day and the conversion rate on such trading day; (3) upon the occurrence of certain corporate events or distributions on our common stock, as described in the offering memorandum for the 2028 Convertible Notes; (4) if we call such notes for redemption; and (5) at any time from, and including, February 15, 2028 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. As of December 31, 2024, the 2028 Convertible Notes were not convertible.
Upon conversion, we will pay cash for the settlement of principal, and for the premium, if applicable, we will pay cash, deliver shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our election. The initial conversion rate for the 2028 Convertible Notes is 
17.8517
 shares of common stock per $1,000 in principal amount of 2028 Convertible Notes, equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $
56.02
 per share of our common stock. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued or unpaid interest.
As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants.
Capped Call Transactions
In connection with the offering of the 2028 Convertible Notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain counterparties (the “Capped Call Transactions”). The Capped Call Transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to holders of our common stock upon conversion of the 2028 Convertible Notes or at our election (subject to certain conditions) offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of such converted 2028 Convertible Notes. The cap price of the Capped Call Transactions is initially $
75.4075
 per share of common stock, representing a premium of 
75
% above the last reported sale price of $
43.09
 per share of common stock on August 15, 2022, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions. As of December 31, 2024, no capped calls had been exercised.
Pursuant to their terms, the capped calls qualify for classification within stockholders’ equity in our consolidated balance sheets, and their fair value is not remeasured and adjusted as long as they continue to qualify for stockholders’ equity classification. We paid approximately $
69.1
 million for the Capped Calls, including applicable transaction costs, which was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital in our consolidated balance sheets. The Capped Call Transactions are separate transactions entered into by us with the capped call Counterparties, are not part of the terms of the 2028 Convertible Notes, and do not affect any holder’s rights under the 2028 Convertible Notes. Holders of the 2028 Convertible Notes do not have any rights with respect to the Capped Call Transactions.

% Convertible Notes due 2027

The 2027 Convertible Notes pay interest semi-annually in arrears on March 1st and September 1st of each year at an annual rate of 
0.25
%. The 2027 Convertible Notes are general unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to all indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2027 Convertible Notes, rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future liabilities that are not so subordinated, are effectively junior to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our current or future subsidiaries. The 2027 Convertible Notes have a maturity date of March 1, 2027.
Holders may convert their 2027 Convertible Notes at their option only in the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on June 30, 2021, if the last reported sale price per share of common stock exceeds 
130
% of the conversion price for each of at least 
20
 trading days during the 
30
 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; (2) during the 
five
 consecutive business days immediately after any 
five
 consecutive trading day period (such 
five
 consecutive trading day period, the “measurement period”) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 
98
% of the product of the last reported sale price per share of our common stock on such trading day and the conversion rate on such trading day; (3) upon the occurrence of certain corporate events or distributions on our common stock, as described in the offering memorandum for the 2027 Convertible Notes; (4) if we call such notes for redemption; and (5) at any time from, and including, September 1, 2026 until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. As of December 31, 2024, the 2027 Convertible Notes were not convertible.
Upon conversion, we will pay cash for the settlement of principal and for the premium, if applicable, we will pay cash, deliver shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our election. The initial conversion rate for the 2027 Convertible Notes is 
12.9576
 shares of common stock per $1,000 in principal amount of 2027 Convertible Notes, equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $
77.17
 per share of our common stock. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment.
As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants.
1.25
% Convertible Notes due 2024
In November 2019, we completed the sale of $
460.0
 million in aggregate principal amount of 
1.25
% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 (the “2024 Convertible Notes”). The net proceeds in connection with the issuance of the 2024 Convertible Notes, after deducting the initial purchasers’ fee of $
12.7
 million, was approximately $
447.3
 million. We also incurred debt issuance cost totaling $
0.3
 million. Debt issuance costs and the initial purchasers’ fee were presented as a debt discount.
In January 2021, we notified the note holders of our irrevocable election to settle the principal of the 2024 Convertible Notes in cash and for the premium, to deliver shares of common stock. The conversion rate for the 2024 Convertible Notes was 
41.9208
 shares of common stock per $1,000 in principal amount of 2024 Convertible Notes, equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $
23.85
 per share of our common stock. The conversion rate was subject to adjustment. 
In January 2023, we issued a notice for the redemption of 2024 Convertible Notes. Holders of the notes could convert their notes at any time prior to the close of the business day prior to the redemption date. In March 2023, holders of the notes elected to convert the 2024 Convertible Notes in full. In connection with the conversion, we paid approximately $
13.5
 million in cash which included principal and accrued interest, and issued 
288,886
 shares of our common stock representing the intrinsic value based on the contractual conversion rate.

Revolving Credit and Term Loan Facilities
In May 2022, we entered into a credit agreement, which was subsequently amended in August 2022 (the “Amendment”), with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and an L/C Issuer, and the other lenders and L/C Issuers party thereto (the “2022 Credit Agreement”), evidencing a credit facility (the “2022 Facility”) that provides for (i) a $
575
 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) and (ii) a $
250
 million term loan facility (the “Term Facility”). Concurrently, with the entry into the Amendment, we repaid the entire outstanding Term Loan Facility and repaid all outstanding loans under the Revolving Credit Facility under the 2022 Credit Agreement. The 2022 Facility will mature on November 30, 2026 unless either the Revolving Credit Facility or the Term Facility is extended prior to such date in accordance with the 2022 Credit Agreement.
The Term Facility requires quarterly scheduled repayments of the term loans in each of the first, second, third and fourth years following the closing in annual amounts equal to 
2.50
%, 
5.00
%, 
7.50
% and 
10.00
% of the initial principal amount of the term loans, respectively. The term loans are also subject to mandatory prepayments from the proceeds of certain asset sales, subject to our right to reinvest the proceeds thereof.
Borrowings under the 2022 Facility bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus: (a) the applicable Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) (which includes a SOFR adjustment of 
0.10
%), or (b) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the federal funds effective rate plus 
0.50
%, (2) the Bank of America prime rate, (3) the Term SOFR rate for an interest period of one month plus 
1.10
%, and (4) 
1.00
%. The margin for the 2022 Facility ranges, based on our consolidated total net leverage ratio, from 
0.25
% to 
1.25
% in the case of base rate loans and from 
1.25
% to 
2.25
% in the case of Term SOFR rate loans. In addition to paying interest on the outstanding principal under the Facility, we will pay (i) a commitment fee in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder and (ii) customary letter of credit fees and agency fees. The commitment fees range from 
0.15
% to 
0.35
% per annum based on our consolidated net leverage ratio.

85
% of the fair market value of the shares on the first business day or the last business day of the offering period, whichever is lower. Share purchases are funded through payroll deduction of at least 
1
% and up to 
15
% of an employee’s compensation for each payroll period, and no employee may purchase shares under the 2021 ESPP that exceeds $
25,000

2,559,594
 shares were available for future purchase. The offering period is generally for a 
six-month
 period and the first offering period commenced on June 16, 2021.

The exercise price of stock options granted is equal to the closing price of the common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model (“Black-Scholes Model”). Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our common stock. The expected term of options granted is based on analyses of historical employee termination rates and option exercises. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield for a period consistent with the expected term of the option in effect at the time of the grant. The dividend yield assumption is based on the expectation of no future dividend payments. 
The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes Model were as follows:

In February 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a new capital return program to repurchase up to $
750.0
 million of our outstanding common stock. In December 2024, we entered into an Accelerated Share Repurchase (“ASR”) agreement with Bank of America to repurchase $
250.0

250.0
 million to Bank of America and took initial delivery of 
4.2
 million shares, representing approximately 
80
 percent of the total shares that will be repurchased under the ASR agreement measured based on the closing price of our common stock on the transaction trade date. The final share count will be determined at the transaction settlement date.
All shares repurchased under our capital return programs have been retired and have resumed their status of authorized and unissued shares.

Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, without consideration for common stock equivalents. Outstanding stock options, unvested RSUs, unvested PSUs, common shares expected to be issued under our ESPP and the Convertible Notes are considered common stock equivalents and are only included in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share when net income is reported and their effect is dilutive. 
Potentially dilutive common shares issuable upon vesting of stock options, RSUs and PSUs are determined using the average share price for each period under the treasury stock method. Potentially dilutive common shares issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes are determined using the if-converted method. Since we have committed to settle the principal amount of the Convertible Notes in cash upon conversion only, the number of shares for the conversion spread will be included as a dilutive common stock equivalent. 

A reconciliation of the numerators and the denominators of the basic and diluted earnings per share computations is as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):

Commitments and Contingencies
Operating Leases
Our properties consist of leased office, laboratory, warehouse and assembly facilities. Our administrative offices and research facilities are located in San Diego, California. We also lease a building in Minnetonka, Minnesota consisting of office, assembly operations, and warehousing space, and have a small administrative office in Ewing, New Jersey. We lease an aggregate of approximately 
162,000
 square feet of space. We pay a pro rata share of operating costs, insurance costs, utilities and real property taxes. Additionally, we lease certain office equipment and vehicles under operating leases. Total rent expense was approximately $
8.6
 million, $
9.3
 million and $
3.3
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Approximate annual future minimum operating lease payments as of December 31, 2024 are as follows (in thousands):

 years. 
Legal Contingencies
From time to time, we may be involved in disputes, including litigation, relating to claims arising out of operations in the normal course of our business. Any of these claims could subject us to costly legal expenses and, while we generally believe that we have adequate insurance to cover many different types of liabilities, our insurance carriers may deny coverage or our policy limits may be inadequate to fully satisfy any damage awards or settlements. If this were to happen, the payment of any such awards could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position. Additionally, any such claims, whether or not successful, could damage our reputation and business. We currently are not a party to any legal proceedings, the adverse outcome of which, in our opinion, individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position.

 A valuation allowance of $
2.4
 million and $
2.6
 million has been established to offset the net DTAs as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as realization of such assets is uncertain.
On a periodic basis, we reassess the valuation allowance of our DTAs, weighing all positive and negative evidence, to assess if it is more-likely-than-not that some or all our DTAs will be realized. After assessing both positive and negative evidence, we determined that it was more likely than not that our DTAs would be realized except for certain deferred tax assets associated with unrealized cash flow hedge and net operating losses in foreign jurisdictions where we do not expect benefit.

 As of December 31, 2024, our unrecognized tax benefit and uncertain tax positions were $
24.5
 million, of which $
23.6
 million will impact the effective tax rate when resolved. Of the unrecognized tax benefits, we do not expect any significant changes to occur in the next 12 months. Interest and/or penalties related to uncertain income tax positions are recognized by us as a component of income tax expense. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized an immaterial amount of interest and penalties.

 million and $
63.1
 million, respectively. The California and other state net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2029.
As of December 31, 2024, we had federal and California research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $
1.1
 million, and $
25.2
 million, respectively. The federal research and development tax credits will begin to expire in 2040 unless previously utilized. The California research and development tax credits will carryforward indefinitely until utilized.

Pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 382, the annual use of the net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credits could be limited by any greater than 50% ownership change during any three-year testing period. As a result of any such ownership change, portions of our net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credits are subject to annual limitations. We completed an updated Section 382 analysis regarding the limitation of the net operating losses and research and development credits as of the acquisition of Antares. Based upon the analysis, we determined that ownership changes occurred in prior years; however, the annual limitations on net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards will not have a material impact on the future utilization of such carryforwards.
We do not provide for U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiary as it is our intention to utilize those earnings in the foreign operations for an indefinite period of time. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were 
no
 undistributed earnings in foreign subsidiaries.
We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and in various state and foreign jurisdictions. Our tax years for 2008 and forward are subject to examination by the U.S. federal and state tax authorities due to the carryforward of unutilized net operating losses and research and development credits.
