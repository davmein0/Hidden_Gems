Overview

Xometry Inc. (“Xometry”, “Company”, “our” or “we”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware in May 2013. Xometry operates a global artificial intelligence (“AI”) powered online manufacturing marketplace and a suite of cloud-based services including Workcenter and Teamspace that are rapidly digitizing the manufacturing industry. Xometry also operates Thomasnet®, a leading North American industrial sourcing platform. Together, these platforms provide manufacturers the critical resources they need to grow their business and makes it easy for buyers to create locally resilient supply chains. Xometry's marketplace uses proprietary AI to assist buyers to efficiently source custom-manufactured parts and assemblies and attain instant pricing and lead times. The AI helps our rapidly growing network of manufacturers by selecting optimal jobs to fill their capacity. Our Thomasnet industrial sourcing platform enables buyers to connect with over 500,000 North American manufacturers and industrial services providers. Our suite of cloud-based services empowers manufacturers and industrial service providers grow their businesses using our advertising, marketing and financial services. Xometry’s corporate headquarters is located in North Bethesda, Maryland.

Xometry’s AI-enabled marketplace, which is available in 18 local languages, is powered by proprietary machine learning algorithms and datasets. Our two-sided marketplace is rapidly digitizing the manufacturing industry, helping customers strengthen their supply chains. Buyers can procure the products they want on demand, and suppliers can reach new customers throughout the world. Our rapidly growing active supplier base enables companies to accelerate their product development and go-to-market strategies. Each interaction on our marketplace provides rich data insights that allow us to continuously improve our AI models and create new products and services, fueling powerful network effects as we scale.

We use proprietary technology to enable product designers, engineers, buyers, and supply chain professionals to instantly access the capacity of a global network of manufacturing facilities. The Company’s platform makes it possible for buyers to quickly receive pricing, expected lead times, manufacturability feedback and place orders on the Company’s platform. The network allows the Company to provide high volumes of unique parts, including custom components and assemblies for its buyers.

Our mission is to accelerate innovation by providing real time, equitable access to global manufacturing capacity and demand. Our vision is to drive efficiency, sustainability and innovation for industries worldwide by lowering the barriers to entry to the manufacturing ecosystem.

Our business benefits from a virtuous network effect, because adding buyers to our platform generates greater demand on our marketplace which in turn attracts more suppliers to the platform, allowing us to rapidly scale and increase the number of manufacturing processes offered on our platform. In order to continue to meet the needs of buyers and remain highly competitive, we expect to continue to add suppliers to our platform that have new and innovative manufacturing processes. Thus, our platform is unbounded by the in-house manufacturing capacity and processes of our current suppliers.

We define “buyers” as individuals who have placed an order to purchase custom-manufactured, on-demand parts or assemblies on our marketplace. Our buyers include engineers, product designers, procurement and supply chain personnel, entrepreneurs, technicians and business owners from small businesses to Fortune 500 companies. We define “accounts” as an individual entity, such as a sole proprietor with a single buyer or corporate entities with multiple buyers, having purchased at least one part on our marketplace. We define “suppliers” as individuals or businesses who have been approved by us to either manufacture a product on our marketplace for a buyer or have utilized our supplier services, including our financial services or the purchase of tools and materials.

The majority of our revenue is derived from the sale of part(s) and assemblies to our customers on our marketplace, which we refer to as marketplace revenue. The suppliers on our platform offer a diversified and expanding mix of manufacturing processes.

46

These manufacturing processes include computer numerical control (“CNC”) manufacturing, sheet metal forming, sheet cutting, 3D printing (including fused deposition modeling, direct metal laser sintering, PolyJet, stereolithography, selective laser sintering, binder jetting, carbon digital light synthesis, multi jet fusion and lubricant sublayer photo-curing), die casting, stamping, injection molding, urethane casting, tube cutting, tube bending, as well as finishing services, rapid prototyping and high-volume production. Xometry's extensible technology platform allows the Company to add new technologies and processes to gain more wallet share with our buyers. We enable buyers to source these processes to meet complex and specific design and order needs across several industries, including Aerospace, Industrial, Medical Devices, Automotive, Consumer Goods, Defense, Government, Energy, Education and Robotics.

We empower suppliers to grow their manufacturing businesses and improve machine utilization by providing access to an extensive, diverse base of buyers. We also offer suppliers supporting products and services to meet their unique needs. The Thomasnet product sourcing and supplier discovery platform provides access to in-depth profiles of 500,000 North American suppliers. Thomas’ suite of advertising services provides suppliers with tailored marketing campaigns to maximize their visibility and enhance engagement with potential buyers. Thomas’ in-house digital marketing agency, Thomas Marketing Services, offers a range of essential digital marketing services, including search engine optimization (“SEO”), to generate leads and boost the awareness and reach of suppliers. In addition, our supplier services include financial service products to facilitate faster payments and a cloud-based manufacturing execution system (“Workcenter”) to help suppliers optimize their productivity.

Factors Affecting Our Performance

Continued Growth in Active Buyers

We must maintain and grow our Active Buyer base and grow our wallet share with existing buyers. We define Active Buyers as the number of buyers who have made at least one purchase on our marketplace during the last twelve months. An increase or decrease in the number of Active Buyers is a key indicator of our ability to attract, retain and engage buyers on our platform. We intend to continue investing in acquiring new buyers through traditional paid sales and marketing techniques as well as leveraging our organic referral network to drive awareness and build trust. The number of Active Buyers on our platform reached 68,267 as of December 31, 2024, up 23% from 55,325 as of December 31, 2023.  Once we acquire a buyer, we seek to expand the breadth and scale of the services sold to that buyer and leverage the relationship to gain additional buyers within an account through a combination of product offerings, customer relationship marketing, sales and account management. We remain focused on increasing wallet share with our existing buyers through a number of deliberate strategies. With each positive experience and the expansion of our manufacturing processes by acquiring new supplier capabilities we will continue building our buyers’ spend and opportunities on our marketplace.

Continued Growth in Our Broad Base of Suppliers

We must maintain and grow our broad selection of suppliers and add to our diverse array of manufacturing processes in order to continue to grow our business and maximize the efficiency of our network. We rely on our network of suppliers to provide the sophisticated manufacturing processes that we offer to our buyers. We believe the value proposition for suppliers, in particular increasing utilization of their manufacturing operations, is compelling. If we fail to attract new suppliers to our platform and retain existing suppliers, the attractiveness of our platform to buyers would decrease and we would not be able to grow our revenue. In order to increase our efficiency, we intend to continue to expand our large and growing network of suppliers. The number of active suppliers, which we define as suppliers that have used our platform at least once during the last twelve months to manufacture a product, has grown 28% from 3,429 for the year ended December 31, 2023 to 4,375 for the year ended December 31, 2024. As we add to our supplier base, our AI-driven pricing becomes more competitive, and therefore more attractive to buyers, leading to higher revenue and improved margins. However, if we do not efficiently price the manufacturing opportunities on our platform, our revenue and margins could be adversely impacted.

Investments in Technology and Expansion of Our Platform

We have invested, and intend to continue to invest, in developing technology, tools, features, and products that provide targeted and useful solutions for our buyers and suppliers. We intend to continue to invest in our AI and machine learning technologies in order to continuously improve the speed and accuracy of our pricing and placement activity. We also continue to invest in our services-oriented architecture and cloud infrastructure to support scalability. Any investments we make in these areas will occur before we recognize benefits, if any, from the investments. Further, the effectiveness of these efforts may be difficult to measure. If we are unable to continue to improve our platform, the efficiency of our platform may be impaired, and our revenue and gross profit may be adversely impacted.

Expansion of Our International Operations

In 2019, we launched Xometry in Europe, followed by Xometry Asia in 2022 and Xometry United Kingdom and Xometry Turkey in 2023. We believe there is significant opportunity in the global manufacturing ecosystem for our marketplace. With

47

operations throughout the majority of the contiguous United States and customers in Europe and Asia, we have established footholds in major markets around the world. As we have expanded our physical presence, we have also added new language functionality to our platforms to reach a wider customer base. As of December 31, 2024, customers can access our platforms in 18 languages. We will continue to dedicate sales and marketing resources to develop our supplier networks and attract buyers to our marketplace in other regions. We may not recognize benefits from these investments, and we may not effectively manage additional risks relating to operating outside the United States, including increased operational and regulatory risks.

Expansion of Our Supplier Services

 In 2020, we launched financial services to help our suppliers manage their cash flow. These services help suppliers manage their business more efficiently, even on jobs that they source outside of our platform. In December 2021, we acquired Thomas Publishing Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Thomas”), which significantly expanded our supplier services to include digital advertising, marketing services and data solutions for our suppliers. Our suite of marketing and data services provided by Thomas help suppliers grow and more efficiently run their business. We offer suppliers a full slate of marketing services, including website building, SEO and targeted advertising to buyers, which are resources that will help them further grow their business. In November 2021, we acquired Fusiform, Inc. (d/b/a FactoryFour), a cloud-based manufacturing execution system. We provide this order management system to our supplier community which allows shops and shop owners to digitize and automate their operations so they can focus on growing their business. In addition to being able to manage existing orders, Workcenter is designed to integrate seamlessly with the AI-driven Xometry marketplace, giving suppliers a one-stop view into all of their orders.

We define Active Paying Suppliers as individuals or businesses who have purchased one or more of our supplier services, including digital marketing services, data services, financial services or tools and materials on our platforms during the last twelve months. An increase or decrease in the number of Active Paying Suppliers is a key indicator of our ability to engage suppliers on our platform. The number of Active Paying Suppliers on our platform was 6,582 as of December 31, 2024, down 9% from 7,271 as of December 31, 2023. The decline during the year ended December 31, 2024 is primarily due to our exit from the tools and materials business and the wind down of Thomas non-core services.

Macroeconomic Conditions

Unfavorable conditions in the economy both in the United States and abroad may negatively affect the growth of our business and our results of operations. For example, macroeconomic events, fluctuations in inflation, the Russia-Ukraine war, conflict in the Middle East and other geopolitical tensions, have led to economic uncertainty globally. Historically, during periods of economic uncertainty and downturns, businesses may slow spending on information technology and manufacturing, which may impact our business and our customers’ businesses.

The effect of macroeconomic conditions may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. If, however, economic uncertainty increases or the global economy worsens, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed. For further discussion of the potential impacts of macroeconomic events on our business, financial condition, and operating results, see the section titled “Risk Factors.”

 Restructurings

 In May 2023 and December 2022
, 
we initiated restructuring actions to help manage our operating expenses by reducing our workforce by approximately 10% in the aggregate. The workforce reduction focused on realigning our staffing levels to help us meet the current and future objectives of our business. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we incurred $0.7 million and $1.5 million, respectively for employee termination costs related to our restructuring. Refer to Note 11, 
Debt and Commitments and Contingencies—Restructuring 
to of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

48

Key Operational and Business Metrics

In addition to the measures presented in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we use the following key operational and business metrics to help us evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and develop forecasts, and make strategic decisions:

Active Buyers

We define Active Buyers as the number of

buyers who have made at least one purchase on our marketplace during the last twelve months. An increase or decrease in the number of Active Buyers is a key indicator of our ability to attract, retain and engage buyers on our platform.

Active Buyers has consistently grown over time. The number of Active Buyers on our platform reached 68,267 as of December 31, 2024, up 23% from 55,325 as of December 31, 2023. The key drivers of Active Buyer growth are continued account and buyer engagement and the success of our strategy to attract new buyers.

49

Percentage of Revenue from Existing Accounts

We define an existing account as an account where at least one buyer has made a purchase on our marketplace. We believe the efficiency and transparency of our business model leads to increasing account stickiness and spend over time. Buyers can utilize our marketplace for both one-off and recurring manufacturing opportunities. For example, a buyer may choose to utilize our marketplace’s CNC manufacturing processes to manufacture a discrete component for a prototype, and then may choose to later use our marketplace to mass produce that same component. A buyer may also recommend our marketplace to other engineers within their organizations who are designing other products and who may use an entirely different set of manufacturing processes, deepening our reach and stickiness with an account.

For the quarter ended December 31, 2024, 97% of our revenue was generated from existing accounts. We believe the repeat purchase activity from existing accounts reflects the underlying strength of our business and provides us with substantial revenue visibility and predictability.

50

Accounts with Last Twelve-Month Spend of At Least $50,000

Accounts with Last Twelve-Month, or LTM, Spend of At Least $50,000 means an account that has spent at least $50,000 on our marketplace in the most recent twelve-month period. We view the acquisition of an account as a foundation for the addition of long-term buyers to our marketplace. Once an account joins our platform, we aim to expand the relationship and increase engagement and spending activities from that account over time. The number of accounts with LTM Spend of at least $50,000 on our platform reached 1,495 as of December 31, 2024, up 12%

from 1,331 as of December 31, 2023.

Active Paying Suppliers

We define Active Paying Suppliers as individuals or businesses who have purchased one or more of our supplier services, including digital marketing services, data services, financial services or tools and materials on our platforms during the last twelve months. An increase or decrease in the number of Active Paying Suppliers is a key indicator of our ability to engage suppliers on our platform.

Active Paying Suppliers has changed over time. The number of Active Paying Suppliers on our platform was 6,582 as of December 31, 2024, down 9% from 7,271 as of December 31, 2023. The key drivers of Active Paying Suppliers are continued supplier engagement and the success of our strategy to attract new suppliers. The decline during the year ended December 31, 2024 is primarily due to our exit from the tools and materials business and the wind down of Thomas non-core services.

51

Adjusted EBITDA

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss, adjusted for interest expense, interest and dividend income and other expenses, benefit for income taxes, and certain other non-cash or non-recurring items impacting net loss from time to time, principally comprised of depreciation and amortization, amortization of lease intangible, stock-based compensation, payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation, lease abandonment, charitable contributions of common stock, income from an unconsolidated joint venture, impairment of assets, restructuring charges, costs to exit the tools and materials business and acquisition and other adjustments not reflective of our ongoing business, such as adjustments related to purchase accounting, the revaluation of contingent consideration, transaction costs and executive severance. Adjusted EBITDA is a performance measure that we use to assess our operating performance and the operating leverage in our business. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA for a period by revenue for the same period.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, Adjusted EBITDA decreased to (1.8)% of revenue, as compared to (5.9)% of revenue in 2023, driven primarily by increased operating efficiencies as we continue to scale our business.

Non-GAAP Net Loss

We define Non-GAAP net loss, as net loss adjusted for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation, amortization of  lease intangible, amortization of deferred costs on convertible notes, loss on sale of property and equipment, charitable contributions of common stock, impairment of assets, lease abandonment and termination, restructuring charges, costs to exit the tools and materials business and acquisition and other adjustments not reflective of our ongoing business, such as adjustments related to purchase accounting, the revaluation of contingent consideration, transaction costs and executive severance.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, Non-GAAP net loss was $(2.1) million, as compared to Non-GAAP net loss of $(19.4) million for the same period in 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2024, Non-GAAP net loss was (0.4)% of revenue, as compared to (4.2)% of revenue for the same period in 2023.

Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP net loss are non-GAAP financial measures that we use, in addition to our GAAP financial measures, to evaluate our business. We have included Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP net loss in this filing because they are key measures used by our management to evaluate our operating performance. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP net loss provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team and board of directors. Our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP net loss may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP measures, if any, reported by our peer companies and therefore may not serve as an accurate basis of comparison among companies. Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP net loss should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Components of Results of Operations

Revenue

Our marketplace revenue is primarily comprised of sales of parts and assemblies to customers through our platform. Buyers purchase specialized CNC manufacturing, sheet metal manufacturing, 3D printing, injection molding, urethane casting, tube cutting, tube bending and finishing services. Customer purchases range from rapid prototyping of single parts to high-volume production on our marketplace. These products are primarily manufactured by our network of suppliers.

Supplier services revenue includes the sale of marketing and advertising services, and to a lesser extent financial service products, SaaS-based solutions and the sale of tools and materials, which was discontinued during the second quarter of 2023.

Cost of Revenue

Marketplace cost of revenue primarily consists of the cost to us of the products that are manufactured or produced by us or our suppliers for delivery to buyers on our platform, internal and external production costs, shipping costs and certain internal depreciation. We expect cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars to the extent our revenue increases and transaction volume increases. As we grow and add suppliers to our platform, we are able to improve our pricing efficiency, we expect cost of revenue to decline as a percentage of revenue over time.

Cost of revenue for supplier services primarily consists of internal and external production costs and website hosting.

Gross Profit

Gross profit, or revenue less cost of revenue, is primarily affected by the growth of our revenue. Our gross profit margin is primarily affected by liquidity of our suppliers’ network and the efficiency of our pricing and will be benefited by increasing the use of existing supplier services and the variety of supplier services offerings over time.

Operating Expenses

Our operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, operations and support, product development and general and administrative functions.

Sales and Marketing

Sales and marketing expenses are expensed as incurred and include the costs of our digital marketing strategies, branding costs and other advertising costs, certain depreciation and amortization expense, contract acquisition costs and compensation expenses, including stock-based compensation, to our sales and marketing employees. We intend to continue to invest in our sales and marketing capabilities in the future to continue to increase our brand awareness, add new accounts and further penetrate existing accounts. We expect sales and marketing expense to increase in absolute dollars in the future as we grow our business, though in the near-term sales and marketing expenses may fluctuate from period-to-period based on the timing of our investments in our sales and marketing functions as these investments may vary in scope and scale over future periods.

Operations and Support

Operations and support expenses are the costs we incur in support of the buyers and suppliers on our platform which are provided by phone, email and chat for purposes of resolving buyer and supplier-related matters. These costs primarily consist of compensation expenses of the support staff, including stock-based compensation, certain depreciation and amortization expense and software costs used in delivering buyer and suppliers services. We expect operations and support expense to increase in absolute dollars in the future, though in the near-term operations and support expenses may fluctuate from period-to-period based on total revenue levels and the timing of our investments in our operations and support functions as these investments may vary in scope and scale over future periods.

Product Development

Product development costs that are not eligible for capitalization are expensed as incurred. This account also includes compensation expenses, including stock-based compensation expenses to our employees performing routine improvements and maintenance on our platforms not related to a specific capitalizable project, software costs and certain depreciation and amortization expense. We expect product development expense to increase in absolute dollars in the future, though in the near-term product development expenses may fluctuate from period-to-period based on total revenue levels and the timing of our investments in our product development functions as these investments may vary in scope and scale over future periods.

54

General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses primarily consist of compensation expenses, including stock-based compensation expenses, for executive, finance, legal and other administrative personnel, professional service fees and certain depreciation and amortization expense.

Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2024 and 2023

Revenue

Total revenue increased $82.1 million, or 18%, from $463.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 to $545.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. This growth was a result of an increase in marketplace revenue, partially offset by a decrease in supplier services revenue. Marketplace revenue increased $91.2 million, or 23%, from $394.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 to $485.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. The increase in marketplace revenue was primarily due to increased buyer activity on the platform for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year period.

Supplier services revenue decreased $9.1 million, or 13%, from $68.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 to $59.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to our exit from the tools and materials business in the U.S. during the second quarter of 2023, a decrease in Thomas non-core services and to a lesser extent a decrease in Thomas advertising and marketing service.

Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $456.7 million and $403.3 million, respectively, for the U.S. reportable segment, and $88.8 million and $60.1 million, respectively, for the International reportable segment.

Cost of Revenue

Total cost of revenue increased $44.8 million, or 16%, from $285.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 to $329.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. This increase was primarily the result of an increase in marketplace cost of revenue offset by a decrease in supplier services costs of revenue. Total cost of revenue from marketplace and supplier services for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $323.4 million and $6.5 million, respectively, as compared to $273.3 million and $11.9 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Marketplace cost of revenue was driven by increased activity and growth on our marketplace which drove increased costs from our suppliers.

Total cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $274.8 million and $247.5 million, respectively for the U.S. reportable segment, and $55.1 million and $37.6 million, respectively, for the International reportable segment.

Gross Profit and Margin

Gross profit increased $37.4 million, or 21%, from $178.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 to $215.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to increases in revenue from marketplace and improved marketplace gross margins as compared to the prior year period.

Gross margin for marketplace was 33.5% for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to 30.8% for the year ended December 31, 2023. The improvement over the prior year period was due largely to our AI-driven platform and expanding supplier network which optimizes pricing to buyers and suppliers. Gross margin for our supplier services increased to 89.0% for the year ended December 31, 2024 from 82.7% for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in gross margin for supplier services is primarily due to a higher mix of advertising and marketing services revenue and the exit from the lower margin tools and materials business.

Operating Expenses

Sales and Marketing

Sales and marketing expense increased $14.7 million, or 16%, from $93.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 to $108.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily due to additional sales and marketing employees and their compensation costs, including stock-based compensation and to a lesser extent advertising expense. As a percent of total revenue, sales and marketing expenses decreased to 19.9% for the year ended December 31, 2024 from 20.2% for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Advertising expense increased 11%, from $31.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 to $35.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 due to increased supplier services and marketplace advertising.

Operations and Support

Operations and support expense increased $6.6 million, or 13%, from $52.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 to $59.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily due to hiring of additional operations and support employees and their

57

compensation costs including stock-based compensation. As a percent of total revenue, operations and support expenses decreased to 10.8% for the year ended December 31, 2024 from 11.3% for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Product Development

Product development expense increased $4.9 million, or 14%, from $34.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 to $39.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily as a result of increases in amortization expense related to developed software assets and additional software costs. As a percent of total revenue, product development expenses decreased to 7.2% for the year ended December 31, 2024 from 7.4% for the year ended December 31, 2023.

General and Administrative

General and administrative expense decreased $6.0 million, or 8%, from $70.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 to $65.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. The primary driver of the decrease was due to the abandonment of multiple company leases resulting in a one-time $8.7 million charge in operating lease expense in 2023 and a decrease in the facilities cost for the abandoned locations. These decreases were offset by increases in compensation cost for general and administrative employees including stock-based compensation. As a percent of total revenue, general and administrative expenses decreased to 11.9% for the year ended December 31, 2024 from 15.3% for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Impairment of assets

Impairment of assets decreased $0.3 million, or 79%, from $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 to $0.1 million  for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Other (Expenses) Income

Interest Expense

Interest expense remained flat at $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. Interest expense is primarily due to the interest on the 2027 Notes issued in February 2022.

Interest and dividend income

Interest and dividend income decreased by $0.8 million, or 7%, from $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 to $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. Interest and dividend income is primarily due to dividend income from our marketable securities
.

Other Expenses

Other expenses decreased $0.7 million, or 50%, from $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 to $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 primarily due to a decrease in various non-income based taxes and the impact of foreign exchange.

Income from Unconsolidated Joint Venture

Income from unconsolidated joint venture remained flat at approximately $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Additional Segment Considerations

Total segment Adjusted EBITDA from our U.S. reportable segment for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $0.2 million and ($15.8) million, respectively. Total segment Adjusted EBITDA from our International reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $(9.8) million and $(11.7) million, respectively.

 Refer to Note 13, 
Segments 
as we changed our measure of segment profit or loss in 2024 to segment Adjusted EBITDA and recast prior year data.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We have financed our operations primarily through sales of our equity securities and borrowings under our convertible notes. As of December 31, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $239.8 million. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to support our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. We believe we will meet our longer-term expected future cash requirements primarily from a combination of cash flow from operating activities and available cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. We may also engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. Our future capital requirements will depend on many

58

factors, including our revenue growth rate, receivable and payable cycles, the timing and extent of investments in product development, sales and marketing, operations and support and general and administrative expenses.

Our capital expenditures consist primarily of internal-use software costs, manufacturing equipment, computers and peripheral equipment, furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements and patents.

Convertible Notes due 2027

In February 2022, we issued $287.5 million aggregate principal amount of 2027 Notes pursuant to an indenture dated February 4, 2022. The 2027 Notes were issued in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2027 Notes were $278.2 million, net of debt issuance costs. The debt issuance costs are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest rate method.

The 2027 Notes are unsecured obligations and bear regular interest at 1% per annum, payable on February 1 and August 1 of each year. The 2027 Notes will mature on February 1, 2027 unless repurchased, redeemed, or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date.

The 2027 Notes are convertible into cash, shares of our Class A common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our Class A common stock, at our election, at an initial conversion rate of 17.8213 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2027 Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $56.11 per share of our Class A common stock. The conversion rate is subject to customary adjustments for certain events as described in the indenture governing the 2027 Notes. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date of the 2027 Notes or if we deliver a notice of redemption in respect of the 2027 Notes, we will, under certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate of the 2027 Notes for a holder who elects to convert its 2027 Notes in connection with such a corporate event or convert its 2027 Notes called (or deemed called) for redemption in connection with such notice of redemption, as the case may be.

We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2027 Notes, at our option, on or after February 5, 2025 if the last reported sale price of our Class A common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2027 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest or additional interest, if any.

Holders of the 2027 Notes may convert all or a portion of their 2027 Notes at their option prior to November 1, 2026, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, only under the following circumstances:

•
if the last reported sale price of our Class A common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the applicable conversion price of the 2027 Notes on each such trading day;

•
during the five-business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the 2027 Notes for each day of that ten consecutive trading day period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our Class A common stock and the applicable conversion rate of the 2027 Notes;

•
on a notice of redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date, in which case we may be required to increase the conversion rate for the 2027 Notes so surrendered for conversion in connection with such redemption notice; or

•
on the occurrence of specified corporate events. 

On or after November 1, 2026, the 2027 Notes are convertible at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date.

In the event of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the 2027 Notes), subject to certain conditions and limited exceptions, holders of the 2027 Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the 2027 Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of 2027 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

We accounted for the issuance of the 2027 Notes as a single liability measured at its amortized cost, as no other embedded features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives.

As of December 31, 2024, the 2027 Notes have a carrying value of $283.6 million with an effective annual interest rate of 1.6%.

We may, from time to time, repurchase our convertible senior notes using cash on hand, either on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.

Operating Activities

For the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was $15.4 million, primarily due to a net loss of $(50.4) million adjusted for non-cash charges of $50.5 million and a net decrease in our operating assets and liabilities of $(15.5) million. The non-cash adjustments primarily relate to stock-based compensation of $29.3 million, depreciation and amortization of $13.0 million and a $4.5 million reduction to our right of use lease assets. The net decrease in operating assets and liabilities is  primarily driven by changes in accounts payable and accrued cost of revenue of $8.7 million due to the timing of payments to vendors and suppliers, accounts receivable of $5.7 million resulting from our continued growth and a reduction in lease liabilities of $6.9 million, offset by changes in other assets of $4.2 million primarily due to a decrease in deferred commissions and other accrued expenses of $2.7 million.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, net cash used in operating activities was $29.9 million, primarily due to a net loss of $(67.5) million adjusted for non-cash charges of $51.2 million and a net decrease in our operating assets and liabilities of $(13.6) million. The non-cash adjustments primarily relate to stock-based compensation of $22.1 million, $14.4 million of reduction to our right of use lease assets and depreciation and amortization of $10.7 million. The net decrease in operating assets and liabilities is primarily driven by changes in accounts receivable of $20.6 million primarily due to our continued growth, lease liabilities of $5.5 million and contract liabilities of $1.4 million, offset by changes in accounts payable and accrued cost of revenue of $12.6 million, prepaid expenses of $1.7 million and other accrued expenses of $1.6 million.

Investing Activities

Cash used in investing activities was $20.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily due to the purchase of equity securities of $18.8 million and the purchase of property and equipment (which includes internal-use software development costs) of $18.1 million, offset by the proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of $16.5 million.

Cash provided by investing activities was $16.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to the proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of $50.0 million offset by the purchase of property and equipment (which includes internal-use software development costs) of $18.5 million, $11.6 million for the purchase of marketable securities, and $3.3 million for the acquisition of Tridi.

Financing Activities

Cash provided by financing activities was $4.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily resulting from  $5.1 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options offset by the payment of contingent considerations related to an acquisition in 2021.

Cash provided by financing activities was $1.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily resulting from  $1.9 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options offset by the payment of contingent considerations related to acquisitions in 2021.

Critical Accounting Estimates

Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

Our critical accounting estimates are those that materially affect our financial statements and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. A thorough understanding of these critical accounting estimates is essential when reviewing our financial statements. We believe that the critical accounting estimates listed below are the most difficult management decisions as they involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions as described above. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results.

Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Goodwill has indefinite useful life and is not amortized. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually on the first day of the fourth quarter, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and tested for impairment if indicators are present.

Goodwill

Our annual impairment assessment of goodwill is generally performed using a qualitative approach to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Performance of the qualitative impairment assessment requires judgment in identifying and considering the significance of relevant events and circumstances including external factors such as macroeconomic and industry conditions and the legal and regulatory environment, as well as entity-specific factors such as market capitalization, actual and planned financial performance, that could impact the fair value of our reporting units.

If the results of the annual qualitative assessment conclude that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, or if interim indicators of impairment are identified, a quantitative impairment test is performed. As permitted in the accounting standards, the Company has the unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit and proceed directly to performing the quantitative assessment.

A quantitative impairment test involves comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded for an amount equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. For goodwill, the impairment loss is limited to the amount of the respective reporting unit’s allocated goodwill. Determination of the fair value of a reporting unit is subjective in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including consideration of external factors such as macroeconomic and industry conditions and the legal and regulatory environment, as well as entity-specific factors such as actual and planned financial performance. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether an impairment charge is recognized and the amount of any such charge. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and recent transactions. These approaches use significant estimates and assumptions, including projected future cash flows, growth rates, margins, discount rates, working capital requirements and capital expenditures. It is possible that our conclusions regarding impairment of goodwill could change in future periods if, for example, our businesses do not perform as projected or overall economic conditions in future periods vary from current assumptions.

 For our U.S. reporting unit, our annual goodwill impairment test was performed as of October 1, 2024. We elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and performed a quantitative assessment to evaluate goodwill. The results of our quantitative assessment indicated that that the fair value of our U.S. reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.

For our International reporting unit, our annual goodwill impairment test was performed as of October 1, 2024. We performed a qualitative assessment, the results of which indicated that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our International reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. No goodwill asset impairment charges were recorded as a result of our annual impairment test during the year ended December 31, 2024.

Intangible assets

Most of our identifiable intangible assets were recognized as part of business combinations we executed in prior periods. Our identifiable intangible assets are considered definite life intangible assets and are primarily comprised of customer and vendor relationships, database, developed technology, trade names, and patents. Definite life intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of useful life.

Our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Refer to our “Business Combinations” disclosure below. We believe that the fair value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions and estimates that a market participant would use. Should current conditions differ from management’s estimates at the time of the acquisition, including changes in future revenue, growth rates and margins, or changes in market factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, could result in a material write-downs of our intangible assets, which would adversely affect our operating results.

We monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of intangible assets may not be recoverable. We review the carrying amounts of our intangible assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Impairment indicators may include any significant changes in the manner of our use of the assets or the strategy of our overall business, certain restructuring initiatives, significant negative industry or economic trends and significant decline in our share price for a sustained period.

61

When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we compare the carrying amounts of the asset or asset groups with their respective estimated undiscounted future cash flows. If the asset or assets group are determined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or assets group exceed their fair value.

m 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Quantitative

and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of exposure to potential changes in interest rates. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

Our U.S. revenue and costs are principally denominated in U.S. dollars and are not subject to foreign currency exchange risk. Our International operating segment generates revenue outside of the United States that is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Our results of operations are impacted by changes in exchange rates. Outside the U.S., our International operations generate approximately 16% of our revenues, of which a majority is generated in Euros. If the average exchange rate of Euros changed unfavorably by 10%, our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 would have decreased by 1.3%. During the year ended December 31, 2024, our revenues were not materially impacted as the average exchange rate remained consistent between the year period ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2024.

Inflation Risk

We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures such as those caused by geopolitical tensions, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Xometry, Inc.:

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Xometry, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 25, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Sufficiency of audit evidence over Marketplace revenue and cost of revenue

As discussed in Notes 2 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company generated $485.9 million of Marketplace revenue and recorded $323.4 million of Marketplace cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company’s recognition of Marketplace revenue and cost of revenue is highly dependent upon the use of information technology (IT) systems.

We identified the evaluation of the sufficiency of audit evidence related to Marketplace revenue and cost of revenue as a critical audit matter. A high degree of auditor judgement was required in evaluating the sufficiency of audit evidence over Marketplace revenue and cost of revenue due to the highly automated nature of certain processes and multiple IT systems. The complexity of the IT systems required the involvement of IT professionals with specialized skills and knowledge.

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We applied auditor judgment to determine the nature and extent of procedures to be performed over Marketplace revenue and cost of revenue. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to Marketplace revenue and cost of revenue processes, including involving IT professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in testing certain general IT, manual, and automated internal controls. We performed a software-assisted data analysis to test relationships among certain revenue transactions,

64

and for a sample of transactions, we compared the revenue recognized to underlying documentation. For a sample of transactions, we compared the cost of revenue recognized to underlying documentation. We evaluated the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained by assessing the results of procedures performed, including the appropriateness of the nature and extent of such evidence.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors
Xometry, Inc.:

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited Xometry, Inc. and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 25, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

XOMETRY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(1)
Organization and Description of Business 

Xometry, Inc. (“Xometry”, the “Company”, “we”, or “our”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware in 
May 2013
.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
(a)
Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Xometry and its subsidiaries.  All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.  The accompanying consolidated financial statements and related disclosures

71

are presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). 
The Company has 
two
 reportable segments which are referred to as: (1) the United States (“U.S.”) and (2) International.

Foreign Operations and Comprehensive Loss

The U.S. dollar (“USD”) is the functional currency for Xometry’s consolidated subsidiary operating in the U.S. The primary functional currency for the Company's consolidated subsidiaries operating in Germany and to a lesser extent, United Kingdom, Turkey, China and Japan, is the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Turkish Lira, Yuan and the Yen, respectively. For the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the USD, the Company translates their financial statements into USD. The Company translates assets and liabilities at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement date. Revenue and expense accounts are translated using an average exchange rate for the period. Gains and losses resulting from translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), as a separate component of equity.

Noncontrolling Interest
We have a 
66.67
% ownership in Incom Co., LTD. As we have a controlling interest in Incom Co., LTD, we have consolidated Incom Co., LTD into our consolidated financial statements. The portion of equity in Incom Co., LTD not owned by the Company is accounted for as a noncontrolling interest. We present the portion of any equity that we do not own in a consolidated entity as noncontrolling interest and classify their interest as a component of total equity, separate from total stockholders’ equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We include net (loss) income attributable to the noncontrolling interests in net loss in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.

(b)
Use of Estimates

The preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, which affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

(c)
Business Combinations 
The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, allocation of the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to the valuation of intangible assets. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if new information is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. 
Acquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.

(d)
Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments

The Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis based on an expected exit price, which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.

The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis, whereby inputs used in valuation techniques are assigned a hierarchical level. The following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fair value:

Level 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

Level 2 - Inputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.

Level 3 - Unobservable inputs reflecting the Company’s own assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques used to determine fair value. These assumptions are required to be consistent with market participant assumptions that are reasonably available.

72

The carrying amounts of certain of the Company’s financial instruments, which include cash and cash equivalents,  accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and contract liabilities approximate their fair values due to their short maturities. The Company's marketable securities are recorded at fair value.

(e)
Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand with various financial institutions. These accounts are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.

(f)
Marketable Securities

 The Company measures its marketable securities at fair value and recognizes any changes in fair value in other expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. Our marketable securities represent our investments in a short term money market fund and/or short term bond fund. These marketable securities have maturities of three months or less. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company's marketable securities of 
$
217.6
 million and $
215.4
 million respectively, 
were recorded at fair value, within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the Company’s Level 1 financial instruments is based on quoted prices in active markets, total fair value is the published market price per unit multiplied by the number of units held without consideration of transaction costs, discounts or blockage factors. 
No
 losses or gains were recorded during the years ended 
December 31, 2024
 and 2023. During the years ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded losses of $
1.9
 million related to these securities which is recorded in other expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.

(g)
Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable are stated at the amount the Company expects to collect from outstanding balances. The Company's accounts receivable do not bear interest. Amounts collected on accounts receivable are included in net cash used in operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For buyers for which the Company provides credit, the Company performs credit inquiries, including reference checks, and queries credit ratings services and other publicly available information. Management provides for probable uncollectible amounts through a provision for bad debt expense and an adjustment to a valuation allowance based on the age of the outstanding amounts, each customer’s expected ability to pay and collection history, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions to determine whether the allowance is appropriate. The Company reviews its valuation allowance monthly. Past due balances over 90 days and over a specified amount are reviewed individually for collectability. Balances that are still outstanding after management has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable.

(h)
Inventory

Inventory consists primarily of work-in-progress, raw materials and finished goods. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method. The Company periodically reviews its inventory for slow-moving, damaged and discontinued items and provides allowances to reduce such items identified to their recoverable amounts, if needed.

(i)
Property and Equipment and Long-Lived Assets

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the assets, which range from 
two
 to 
ten years
, or in the case of leasehold improvements, over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the useful life of the asset.

73

Property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group to be tested for possible impairment, the Company first compares undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary.

Property and equipment includes capitalized internal-use software development costs. Eligible internal-use software development costs are capitalized subsequent to the completion of the preliminary project stage. Such costs include internal and external direct development costs totaling $
17.0
 million and $
19.7
 million for the years ended 
December 31, 2024 and 2023
, respectively. After all substantial testing and deployment is completed and the software is ready for its intended use, capitalization is discontinued and the internal-use software costs are placed in service and amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, generally three years.

(j)
Investment In Unconsolidated Joint Venture
We account for our investment in unconsolidated joint venture using the equity method of accounting as we exercise significant influence, but do not control the entity. Under the equity method of accounting, the net equity investments of the Company are reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and the Company’s share of net income from the joint venture is included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.

On a periodic basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the Company’s investment in the unconsolidated joint venture may be other-than-temporarily-impaired. An investment is impaired only if management’s estimate of the value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment, and such a decline in value is deemed to be other than-temporary. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the estimated fair value of the investment. Evidence of a loss in value might include, but would not necessarily be limited to, absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment or inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment. This evaluation consists of several qualitative and quantitative factors including recent financial results and operating trends of the investee and available information that may affect the value of our investment.

No
 impairment loss on our investment in unconsolidated joint venture was recognized during the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023
 and 2022.
(k)
Revenue
The Company derives the majority of its U.S. and International marketplace revenue from the sale of parts and assemblies fulfilled using a vast network of suppliers. The Company recognizes revenue from the sales to our customers pursuant to Financial Accounting Standard Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 
Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 (“ASC 606”).

The Company determines that a contract exists between the Company and the customer when the customer accepts the quote and places the order, all of which are governed by the Company’s standard terms and conditions or other agreed terms with Xometry’s buyers. Upon completion of an order through Xometry’s platform, the Company identifies the performance obligation(s) within that order to complete the sale of the manufactured part(s) or assembly. Using Xometry’s in-house technology, the Company determines the price for the manufactured part(s) or assembly on a stand-alone basis at order initiation. The Company recognizes revenue from sales to Xometry’s customers upon shipment, at which point control over the part(s) or assembly has transferred.

The Company has concluded that the Company is principal in the sale of part(s) and assemblies that use the Company’s network of third-party manufacturers because the Company controls the manufacturing by obtaining a right to direct a third-party manufacturer to fulfill the performance obligation Xometry has with the Company’s customers on Xometry’s behalf. The Company has considered the following conditions of the sale: (i) the Company has the obligation of providing the specified product to the customer, (ii) the Company has discretion with respect to establishing the price of the product and the price the Company pays the suppliers and the Company has margin risk on all of Xometry’s sales, (iii) the Company has discretion in determining how to fulfill each order, including selecting the supplier and (iv) Xometry bears certain risk for product quality to the extent the customer is not satisfied with the final product.

Xometry also derives revenue from its supplier services which is a suite of services offered to our suppliers. Revenue also includes the sale of marketing services which includes advertising. This revenue is generally recognized as control is

74

transferred to the customer, in an amount reflecting the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for such product or service. From time to time, a purchase order with a customer may involve multiple performance obligations, including a combination of some or all of our products. Judgment may be required in determining whether products are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or as one combined performance obligation. Revenue is recognized over the period or at the point in time in which the performance obligations are satisfied. Consideration is typically determined based on a fixed unit price for the quantity of product transferred. For purchase orders involving multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling price, and recognized as revenue when each individual product or service is transferred to the customer.

Revenue is shown net of estimated returns, refunds, and allowances. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company has a provision for estimated returns, refunds or allowances of
 $
0.1

million and

$
0.1
 million, respectively.

Sales tax collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities is excluded from revenue.

Contract Liabilities

Contract liabilities are derived from payments received at the time an order is placed, for which the associated performance obligations have not been satisfied and revenue has not been recognized based on the Company’s revenue recognition criteria described above.

The following table is a summary of the contract liabilities (in thousands):

Sales Contract Acquisition Costs

The Company’s incremental costs to obtain a contract may include a sales commission which is generally determined on a per order basis. 
For marketplace contracts, the Company recognizes costs over a period of one year or less. For supplier service contracts in excess of one year, the Company amortizes such costs on a straight-line basis over the average customer life of 
two years
 for new customers and over the renewal period for existing customers which is generally 
one year
. Sales commissions are included in sales and marketing expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. For the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we
 recognized approximately $
6.3
 million, $
8.1
 million and $
6.1
 million, respectively of amortization related to deferred sales commissions. As of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023
, the Company had deferred sales contract acquisition costs of $
0.4
 million and $
3.1
 million, respectively which is classified in other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

(l)
Cost of Revenue 
Cost of revenue for marketplace primarily consists of the cost of the products that are manufactured or produced by the Company’s suppliers for delivery to buyers on the Company's platform, internal and external production costs, shipping costs, and certain internal depreciation.
Cost of revenue for supplier services primarily consists of internal and external production costs and website hosting.
(m)
Leases

The Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease and the classification of that lease, if applicable, at its inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use ("ROU") assets, operating lease liabilities and operating lease liabilities (net of current portion) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For leases with terms of twelve months or less, the Company does not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Additionally, the Company elected to use the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for leases of real estate,

75

meaning that for these leases, the non-lease components are included in the associated ROU asset and lease liability balances on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments under the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The implicit rate within the Company’s operating leases is generally not determinable, as such the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement to determine the present value of lease payments. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease prepayments, offset by lease incentives. Certain of the Company’s leases include options to extend or terminate the lease. The expected lease term includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise such option.

Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

(n)
Sales and Marketing 
Sales and marketing expenses are expensed as incurred and include the costs of digital marketing strategies, branding costs and other advertising costs, certain depreciation and amortization expense, contract acquisition costs and compensation expenses, including stock-based compensation, to the Company’s sales and marketing employees. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
, the Company’s advertising costs were $
35.1
 million, $
31.7
 million and $
33.5
 million, respectively.

(o)
Operations and Support 
Operations and support expenses are the costs the Company incurs in support of the customers and suppliers on Xometry’s platforms which are provided by phone, email and chat for purposes of resolving customer and supplier related matters. These costs primarily consist of compensation expenses of the support staff, including stock-based compensation, certain depreciation and amortization expense and software costs used in delivering customer and supplier services.

(p)
Product Development

Product development costs which are not eligible for capitalization are expensed as incurred. This account also includes compensation expenses, including stock-based compensation to the Company’s employees 
performing routine improvements and maintenance on our platforms not related to a specific capitalizable project, software costs and certain depreciation and amortization expense.
(q)
General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses primarily consist of compensation expenses, including stock-based compensation expenses, for executive, finance, legal and other administrative personnel, professional service fees and certain depreciation and amortization expense.

(r)
Stock Based Compensation

All stock-based compensation, including stock options, restricted stock units and performance restricted stock units (“PRSUs”), are measured at the grant date fair value of the award. The fair value of the restricted stock units and PRSUs is determined using the fair value of the Company's Class A common stock on the date of grant. The Company estimates grant date fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of stock options, PRSUs and restricted stock units is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is typically three to four years. Forfeitures are recorded in the period in which they occur.

The Black-Scholes model considers several variables and assumptions in estimating the fair value of stock-based awards. These variables include:

•
expected annual dividend yield; 
•
expected volatility over the expected term; 
•
expected term; 
•
risk free interest rate; 
•
per share value of the underlying common stock; and 
•
exercise price. 

76

For all stock options granted, the Company calculated the expected term using the simplified method for “plain vanilla” stock option awards. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield available on U.S. Treasury issuances similar in duration to the expected term of the stock-based award. The Company estimates its expected share price volatility based on the historical volatility of publicly traded peer companies and/or its own volatility and expects to continue to do so until such time as it has adequate historical data regarding the volatility of its own traded share price. The Company utilized a dividend yield of zero, as it had no history or plan of declaring dividends on its common stock.

The fair value for PRSUs is recognized on a ratable basis over the requisite service period of three years when it is probable the performance conditions of the awards will be met. The Company reassesses the probability of vesting at each reporting period and adjusts the total compensation expense of the award based on this probability assessment.
(s)
Net Loss Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders

The Company computes net loss per share using the two-class method required for multiple classes of common stock and participating securities. The two-class method requires income available to common stockholders for the year to be allocated between common stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the year had been distributed. Certain unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends are treated as participating securities and therefore included in computing net income per share using the two-class method. The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the Class A common stock and Class B common stock are substantially identical, other than voting rights. Accordingly, the Class A common stock and Class B common stock share proportionately in the Company’s net losses.

(t)
Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

To the extent that it is not considered to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized, a valuation allowance is established.
The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained and are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the year in which the change in judgment occurs.

(u)
Commitments and Contingencies

Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred.

(v)
Intangible Assets

Intangible assets are carried at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from 
one
 to 
17 years
. Xometry reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment under the long-lived asset model described in Property and Equipment and Long-Lived Assets above.

(w)
Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized. The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, might be impaired.

In testing for goodwill impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. These qualitative factors assessed may include the following: (i) significant changes in the manner of our use of the assets or the strategy of our overall business, (ii) certain restructuring initiatives, (iii) significant negative industry or economic trends and (iv) significant decline in our share price for a sustained period. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then additional impairment testing is not required. However, if we conclude otherwise, we proceed to the quantitative assessment.

77

When impairment indicators are identified, the Company compares each reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying amount, including goodwill. An impairment loss is recognized as the difference, if any, between each reporting unit’s carrying amount and its fair value to the extent the difference does not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.

Xometry determines the fair value of each reporting unit using a weighted income-based and market-based approach.

Under the income approach, the Company based its fair value on estimated discounted future cash flows of each reporting unit. Determining the fair value of each reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including projected future cash flows, growth rates, margins, discount rates, working capital requirements and capital expenditures, among others (Level 3).

Under the market-based approach, the value of a reporting unit using the market-based approach is estimated by comparing the reporting unit to other publicly-traded companies and/or to publicly-disclosed business mergers and acquisitions in similar lines of business. The value of a reporting unit is based on pricing multiples of certain financial parameters observed in the comparable companies. We also make estimates and assumptions for market values to determine a reporting unit’s estimated fair value. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and the goodwill impairment test result.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and performed a quantitative assessment to evaluate the goodwill of the U.S. reporting unit. The results of our quantitative assessment indicated that the fair value of our U.S. reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, we performed a qualitative assessment to evaluate the goodwill of the International reporting unit, the results of which indicated that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our International reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.
During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022
, the Company performed its qualitative assessment and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values.

(x)
Reclassifications

The Company reclassified accrued cost of revenue from accrued expenses to accounts payable and accrued cost of revenue on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets to conform to the current period presentation. This reclassification did not change the results of operations of prior periods.
(y)
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards 
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) No. 
2023-07
, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires a public entity to disclose significant segment expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim basis and provide in interim periods all disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. Additionally, it requires a public entity to disclose the title and position of the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”). The ASU did not change how a public entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates them, or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments. The new standard became effective for Xometry in December 2024. Xometry applied the amendments in this ASU retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. We have reflected the adoption of this ASU in Note 13 - 
Segments.

(z)
Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which focuses on the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. ASU No. 2023-09 requires a public business entity (“PBE”) to disclose, on an annual basis, a tabular rate reconciliation using both percentages and currency amounts, broken out into specified categories with certain reconciling items further broken out by nature and jurisdiction to the extent those items exceed a specified threshold. In addition, all entities are required to disclose income taxes paid, net of refunds received disaggregated by federal, state/local, and foreign and by jurisdiction if the amount is at least 5% of total income tax payments, net of refunds received. For PBEs, the new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. An entity may apply the amendments in this ASU prospectively by providing the revised disclosures for the period ending December 31, 2025, and continuing to provide the pre-ASU disclosures for the prior periods, or may apply the amendments retrospectively by providing the revised disclosures for all periods presented. We expect this ASU to only impact our disclosures with no impacts to our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.

In November 2024, FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses (“ASU 2024-03”). Under ASU 2024-03, a PBE would be required to disclose information about purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, intangible asset amortization, and depletion for each income statement line item that contains those expenses. ASU 2024-03 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. ASU 2024-03 allows for early adoption and requires either prospective adoption to financial statements issued for reporting periods after the effective date of ASU 2024-03 or retrospectively to any or all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently assessing the impact of ASU 2024-03 on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In November 2024, FASB issued ASU No. 2024-04, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20): Induced Conversions of Convertible Debt Instruments which clarifies the assessment of whether certain settlements of convertible debt instruments should be accounted for as an inducement conversion or extinguishment of convertible debt. The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2025, and interim periods within those annual periods. We are currently evaluating the impact of the standard on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

There are currently no other accounting standards that have been issued, but not yet adopted, that are expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows upon adoption.

 Leases 

The Company leases its offices under non-cancelable lease agreements which expire between 
2025
 and 
2029
. Certain of these arrangements have free rent, escalating rent payment provisions, lease renewal options, and tenant allowances. Because the Company is not reasonably certain to exercise these renewal options, the options are not considered in determining the lease term, and the associated potential option payments are excluded from the lease payments. Under such arrangements, the Company recognizes an ROU asset and lease liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Variable rent may include items such as common area maintenance and real estate taxes.

The Company subleases a portion of its office in New York City to three other companies (the “Sublessees”). The Sublessees pay the Company a portion of the rent under the existing lease with the landlord (the “Head Lease”), the Company was not relieved from its legal obligation to the landlord under the Head Lease. Accordingly, an operating lease liability and an operating lease ROU asset is reflected on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets related to the Head Lease.

During 2023, the Company assessed its lease portfolio.  As a result, the Company abandoned certain leases and/or portions of its leases in New York, NY, Horsham, PA, Culver City, CA, Doraville, GA and Gaithersburg, MD.  As a result of abandoning these leases, the Company ceased its use of these locations and accelerated the amortization of the ROU assets to reduce the ROU assets carrying values to zero. The Company recognized a one-time charge of $
8.7
 million of additional operating lease expense during 2023 in general and administrative on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The Company will continue to pay the rent owed under the existing lease agreements.

Income Taxes 
For the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023
 and 2022, the Company has income tax benefit (provision) of $
0.1
 million, $
0.4
 million and $(
0.1
) million, respectively. The Company's tax benefit is comprised of a current and deferred state tax (benefit) of $
0.1
 million and $(
0.1
) million, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2024 and a current and deferred state tax (benefit) of $(
0.2
) million and $(
0.2
) million, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
This estimated annual effective tax rate of 
0
% differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to the effects of certain permanent items, foreign tax rate differences, and increases in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets.
The reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the Company’s effective tax rate was as follows:

Tax Valuation Allowance

In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences become deductible. Management considers scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projecting future taxable income, and tax planning strategies that can be implemented by the Company in making the assessment.

As of December 31, 2024, and 2023
, the Company had a valuation allowance of $
85.2
 million and $
73.4
 million, 
respectively, against certain deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance relates to the deferred tax assets of the Company’s

85

U.S. 
entities, including federal and state tax attributes and timing differences, as well as the deferred tax assets of its foreign subsidiaries. The increase in the valuation allowance during 2024 is primarily related to the pre-tax losses generated in the U.S. and non-U.S. operations.

Net Operating Loss and Credit Carryforwards

As of December 31, 2024
, the Company has net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and similar state amounts, of approximately $
250.8
 million available to reduce future income subject to income taxes before limitations. As of 
December 31, 2024
, the Company had a net operating loss carryforward for tax purposes related to its foreign subsidiaries of $
64.4
 million. U.S. federal net operating carryforwards generated prior to 2018 in the approximate amount of $
61.5
 million will begin to expire, if not utilized, in 2025. Our non-U.S. net operating loss and U.S. federal net operating losses post 2017 have an indefinite life. 
Under the provisions of U.S. Internal Revenue Code Section 382, certain substantial changes in the Company’s ownership may result in a limitation in the amount of U.S. net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income
.

Of the total loss carryforward available, approximately $
57.2
 million of net operating losses were attributable to the acquisition of Thomas Publishing Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Thomas”). 
During 2022, management completed its evaluation of any limitations on the ability of the Company to utilize the Thomas net operating loss carryforward. As a result of this evaluation, management has determined that the annual limitation, as determined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, would not prevent the Company from utilizing the net operating losses before expiration to the extent the Company is able to generate sufficient future taxable income.

Uncertain Tax Positions

For uncertain tax positions, the Company uses a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefits determined on a cumulative probability basis, which are more-likely-than-not to be realized upon ultimate settlement in the financial statements. Our gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions were not material to the Company's financial position or operations for all periods presented.

The Company’s federal and state income tax returns are subject to examination by income taxing authorities, generally for three years after the returns are filed. However, tax attribute carryforwards may still be adjusted upon examination by tax authorities. The Company is not currently under examination by any tax jurisdiction for federal or state income taxation
.

Net Loss Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders 
The Company computes net loss per share of Class A common stock, Class B common stock and participating securities using the two-class method. Basic and diluted EPS are the same for each class of common stock and participating securities because they are entitled to the same liquidation and dividend rights. 
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders (in thousands, except share and per share data):

Debt and Commitments and Contingencies 

2027 Convertible Notes

In February 2022, we issued $
287.5
 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due in 2027 (the “2027 Notes”) pursuant to an indenture dated 
February 4, 2022
. The 2027 Notes were sold in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2027 Notes were $
278.2
 million, net of debt issuance costs. 
The debt issuance costs are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest rate method.

The 2027 Notes are unsecured obligations and bear regular interest at 
1
% per annum, payable on February 1 and August 1 of each year. The 2027 Notes will mature on 
February 1, 2027
 unless repurchased, redeemed, or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date.

The 2027 Notes are convertible into cash, shares of our Class A common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our Class A common stock, at our election, at an initial conversion rate of 
17.8213
 shares of Class A common stock per $
1,000
 principal amount of 2027 Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $
56.11
 per share of our Class A common stock. The conversion rate is subject to customary adjustments for certain events as described in the indenture governing the 2027 Notes. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date of the 2027 Notes or if we deliver a notice of redemption in respect of the 2027 Notes, we will, under certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate of the 2027 Notes for a holder who elects to convert its 2027 Notes in connection with such a corporate event or convert its 2027 Notes called (or deemed called) for redemption in connection with such notice of redemption, as the case may be.

We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2027 Notes, at our option, on or after February 5, 2025 if the last reported sale price of our Class A common stock has been at least 
130
% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 
30
 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption, at a redemption price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the 2027 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

Holders of the 2027 Notes may convert all or a portion of their 2027 Notes at their option prior to November 1, 2026, in multiples of $
1,000
 principal amounts, only under the following circumstances:
•
if the last reported sale price of our Class A common stock for at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of 
30
 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 
130
% of the applicable conversion price of the 2027 Notes on each such trading day;
•
during the 
five
 business day period after any 
ten
 consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $
1,000
 principal amount of the 2027 Notes for each day of that ten consecutive trading day period was less than 
98
% of the product of the last reported sale price of our Class A common stock and the applicable conversion rate of the 2027 Notes;
•
on a notice of redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date, in which case we may be required to increase the conversion rate for the 2027 Notes so surrendered for conversion in connection with such redemption notice; or

87

•
on the occurrence of specified corporate events. 

On or after November 1, 2026, the 2027 Notes are convertible at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date.

In the event of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the 2027 Notes), subject to certain conditions and limited exceptions, holders of the 2027 Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the 2027 Notes at a price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of 2027 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

We accounted for the issuance of the 2027 Notes as a single liability measured at its amortized cost, as no other embedded features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives.

Contingencies

The Company may, from time to time, be subject to various claims and legal proceedings covering a range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities. In the opinion of the Company, although the outcome of any legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, the ultimate liability of the Company in connection with its legal proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or operations.

Restructuring
 In May 2023 and December 2022
, 
we initiated restructuring actions to help manage our operating expenses by reducing our workforce. For the year ended December 31, 2023
 and 2022, we incurred $
0.7
 million and $
1.5
 million, respectively, for employee termination costs related to this restructuring. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had less than $
100,000
 of accrued and unpaid restructuring costs 
recorded in other accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheet
. 
No
 amounts were payable as of December 31, 2024.

Exit from the Tools and Materials Business
The Company previously provided suppliers with access to competitively priced tools and material and supplies in the U.S. As a result of exiting the tools and materials business (our "tools and materials business", which we previously referred to as our "supplies business”) during 2023, the Company recognized $
0.6
 million of costs associated with its closure, of which $
0.2
 million is recognized in cost of revenue and $
0.4
 million is recognized in operations and support on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.
Defined Contribution Plans
We sponsor a defined contribution plan for qualifying employees, including a 401(k) Plan in the United States to which we make matching contributions of 
50
% of participating employee contributions up to 
6
% of eligible income. Our total matching contribution to the 401(k) Plan was $
2.2
 million, $
2.1
 million and $
1.6
 million for the years ending 
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
, respectively.

(12)
Acquisitions 

Tridi
On January 2, 2023, the Company acquired Tridi Teknoloj A.S. (“Tridi”) located in Istanbul, Türkiye pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement. The acquisition of Tridi extends the Company's marketplace capabilities in Europe and provides the Company with access to the Turkish market. The Company accounted for the acquisition as a business combination. The goodwill of $
4.8
 million arising from the acquisition of Tridi related to expected synergies including access to the Turkish market and an established supplier network. The goodwill is included in our International reporting segment and is not deductible for tax purposes. The aggregate non-contingent portion of the purchase price was approximately $
3.8
 million in cash, of which approximately $
0.4
 million 
was withheld and paid during 2024
. 
In addition, the purchase price included a contingent consideration arrangement to the former owner of Tridi up to a maximum amount of $
1.25
 million (undiscounted) in shares of the Company’s Class A common stock in two installments on the first and second anniversary of the acquisition
. The contingent consideration arrangement is tied to the achievement of revenue thresholds. The initial fair value of the contingent consideration of $
0.9
 million was estimated by applying an income valuation approach. The measurement is based on inputs that are not observable in the market (Level 3 inputs). Key assumptions made include (a) discount rate and (b) probability weighted assumptions about achieving revenue thresholds. 
As of  December 31, 2024
 and 2023, the total contingent consideration had a fair value of $
0.6
 million and $
1.1
 million, respectively. 
During the year ended December 31, 2024
 and 2023, the Company recorded an approximate $
0.1
 million and $
0.3
 million increase to the contingent consideration liability with a corresponding expense recognized in general and administrative expense on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. 
In January 2024 and January 2025, the Company issued 
21,083
 and 
16,716
 shares, respectively of Class A common stock with a value of
 $
0.6
 million to the former owners of Tridi with respect to the first and second installments.

The estimated fair value of the intangible asset acquired was determined by the Company. The Company engaged a third‑party expert to assist with the valuation analysis. The Company used a cost method to estimate the fair value of the vendor relationship using Level 3 inputs. The useful life of the vendor relationship is 
10
 years.

Tridi’s results of operations were included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition, January 2, 2023. The acquisition of Tridi was not considered material to the Company for the years presented, and therefore, proforma information has not been presented.

Segments 
Xometry is organized in 
two
 segments referred to as: (1) the U.S. and (2) International. Xometry’s operating segments are also the Company’s reportable segments. Xometry’s reportable segments are managed separately based on geography. The Company’s U.S. revenues primarily result from the sales of parts and assemblies and the sale of advertising and marketing services. The Company's International revenues primarily result from the sale of parts and assemblies. Xometry’s 
two
 segments are defined based on the reporting and review process used by the 
chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), the Chief Executive Officer
.

The Company evaluates the performance of the operating segments primarily based on revenue and segment Adjusted EBITDA. 
The CODM uses actual results compared to budgeted or forecasted segment Adjusted EBITDA to determine if the reporting units are making progress toward profitability and when making decisions about the allocation of resources and the assessment of performance.
 In 2023 and 2022, the Company had determined that revenue and segment profit before income taxes was its measures of segment performance. In 2024, the Company changed its segment profit or loss measure to segment Adjusted EBITDA based on a reassessment of the information currently provided to the CODM. The Company has 
recast segment Adjusted EBITDA for the prior years
.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA excludes interest expense, interest and dividend income, other expenses, benefit (provision) for income taxes, and certain other non-cash or non-recurring items impacting net loss from time to time, principally comprised of depreciation and amortization, amortization of lease intangible, stock-based compensation, payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation, lease abandonment, charitable contributions of common stock, income from an unconsolidated joint venture, impairment of assets, restructuring charges, costs to exit the tools and materials business and acquisition and other adjustments not reflective of our ongoing business, such as adjustments related to purchase accounting, the revaluation of contingent consideration, transaction costs and executive severance.

The Company’s CODM monitors assets of the consolidated Company, but does not use assets, by operating segment when assessing performance or making operating segment resource decisions.

Engineering 
News brand, certain magazines, videos, website and associated electronic media products for industrial engineers.

tem 9A. Controls and Procedures.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

Pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2024.

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate “internal control over financial reporting,” as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.

Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm

Our independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has issued an audit report with respect to our internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may

95

become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
