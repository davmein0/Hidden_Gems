Growth Strategy
Our primary objective is to maximize long-term shareholder value through a combination of financial performance, acquisition and organic growth, and strategic asset positioning, while operating in a safe and environmentally sound manner. Throughout our history we have worked with many of our key customers to improve their environmental footprint and to help meet sustainability goals by increasing their recycling rates, diverting organic materials out of the waste stream into beneficial use processes, and partnering to develop resource solutions within their organizations or communities. Since we first began operating in Vermont in 1975, 50 years ago, our business strategy has been firmly tied to creating a sustainable resource management model, and we continue to be rooted in these same tenets today. 
We continue to invest in resources (team, technology, facilities, and capital) to further develop this important long-term strategy that we believe differentiates our service offerings to our customers, makes us an employer of choice for our people, and improves our economic returns. We strive to create long-term value for all of our stakeholders, including customers, employees, communities and shareholders.
We closed on eight acquisitions in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 (“ fiscal year 2024”), which further densified our Mid-Atlantic platform, expanded our operations into New Jersey as well as New York’s middle and lower Hudson Valley, and closed on several tuck-in acquisitions within our existing footprint. We believe that we are well-positioned to explore and capitalize on future growth opportunities. For information regarding our business acquisitions, see Note 5, 
Business Combinations

Increasing Landfill Returns
Over the last 10 years, disposal capacity has tightened in the Northeast market as permanent site closures have reduced capacity and greater volumes are leaving the market via rail to out-of-state disposal sites. Given this backdrop and the positioning of our assets, and in response to persistent cost inflation, we advanced landfill pricing by 4.4% for fiscal year 2024, as compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (“fiscal year 2023”). We believe that a positive pricing backdrop will continue, as additional site closures may occur over the next several years.
We have been active in seeking to develop additional landfill capacity, and in fiscal year 2024, our rail-served operations commenced at our Subtitle D landfill located in Mount Jewett, Pennsylvania (“McKean Landfill”). While the initial volumes have been modest, as expected, we believe this facility has the potential to provide further disposal certainty to our customers and to the Northeast market over time. Over the years, we have been successful in advancing key permitting activities at select sites across our footprint, resulting in increased annual capacity limits and expanded total permitted capacity. Since early 2016, we have advanced permit increases at our Subtitle D landfills, cumulatively adding approximately 0.5 million tons per year of permitted capacity and approximately 50.9 million cubic yards of total permitted airspace. 
We also continue to focus on improving our landfill returns and operations through various initiatives related to internalization opportunities, sourcing of profitable volumes, enhanced safety, improved compliance, consistent operating practices, and capital efficiency programs. 
Driving Additional Profitability in Collection Operations
Collection pricing was up 6.5% for fiscal year 2024, as compared to fiscal year 2023, with sustained execution against our strategic pricing programs, which helped to offset cost inflation. We also continue to advance several key operational initiatives, including route optimization and automation, acquisition integration and maintenance programs to further reduce our operating costs and improve safety in our collection operations. Our comprehensive fleet plan is designed to optimize our fleet and target truck replacements in order to maximize returns, reduce our operating expenses through lower maintenance costs, improve our service levels through reduced down times, and increase automation and optimization of trucks and service types.
From a technology perspective, we continue to advance business intelligence tools that provide our teams with actionable data as well as investment and deployment of on-board-computers and cameras designed to enhance safety and service and modernize our fleet. We also remain focused on acquisition integration as we work diligently to onboard new customers and employees, while enhancing service accuracy, increasing operating efficiencies, and optimizing the internalization of solid waste and recycling volumes into our facilities.
The combination of these operating advancements and pricing programs are driving improved results in our collection operations. In addition, we remain focused on mitigating fuel cost exposure through our floating fuel cost recovery fee program.
Creating Incremental Value Through Resource Solutions
Our Resource Solutions operating segment's business strategy is focused on driving value-added resource management and sustainability-oriented solutions to our customers. These solutions range from professional services to large industrial, institutional or multi-site retail customers, our organics business, which provides organics processing and disposal, and our large scale, technology-driven recycling business.
We leverage our core competencies in materials processing, industrial recycling, organics and resource management service offerings to deliver a comprehensive solution for our larger commercial, municipal, institutional, and industrial customers with more diverse waste and recycling needs. Our processing operations consist of our recycling and biosolids facilities where we receive inbound materials, process the volume, and sell the resulting products into end markets.
A focus of our recycling business model is to reduce exposure to recycling commodity price volatility and drive adequate returns in all market cycles. We have accomplished this by: (1) restructuring most third-party processing contracts to limit downside risk through processing fees; (2) implementing our sustainability recycling adjustment fee (“SRA Fee(s)”) that floats inversely to changes in recycling commodity prices; (3) investing in processing infrastructure to reduce operating costs and improve the quality of post-sorted commodities, such as the replacement and upgrade of the processing equipment at select materials recovery facilities (“MRF”); and (4) developing strong partnerships with industrial consumers of recycled materials to ensure circularity. Where implemented, our risk mitigation programs offset most recycling commodity price decline and allow us to return value to our customers with higher recycling commodity prices through lower tipping fees and a lower SRA Fee. Given our growth strategy, at times, the businesses we acquire may not have sufficient risk mitigation programs and thus may temporarily increase our recycling commodity risk exposure. Over time, we strive to mitigate recycling commodity risk exposure and improve returns.
Our National Accounts business consists of brokerage and resource management services provided to large customers with broad sustainability needs. This professional services business drove positive sales growth in fiscal year 2024 as National 
5
Table of Contents
Accounts volumes increased 4.3% as compared to fiscal year 2023. This volume growth reflects our sales expertise coupled with increased demand for resource management services from select larger customers. We remain focused on helping large industrial and institutional customers develop and achieve actionable resource management and sustainability goals.
Allocating Capital to Return-Driven Growth
We have focused on a balanced growth strategy through a combination of acquisitions, development projects, and new contracts while adhering to strict capital discipline standards, with the objective of maximizing risk-adjusted returns on capital invested and maintaining prudent capitalization. Consistent with this strategy, we have grown our business and maintained conservative debt levels with a consolidated net leverage ratio of 2.54x as of December 31, 2024. See Item 7. “
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more disclosure about our consolidated net leverage ratio. We believe the strength of our balance sheet coupled with a robust acquisition pipeline positions us well for continued execution against our growth strategy.
We have acquired 68 solid waste collection, transfer and recycling businesses since the beginning of 2018 through fiscal year 2024 with over $800 million of total annualized revenues. This includes eight solid waste, collection, transfer and recycling businesses acquired in fiscal year 2024 with over $200 million in total annualized revenues.
We expect to adhere to our disciplined capital return hurdles and rigorous review and risk management process in executing against our acquisition and development opportunities. We are focused on acquiring well-run businesses in strategic markets across our footprint and in markets that will drive additional operating synergies and provide opportunities to grow profitably, and further our potential to expand into new market areas over time.
Strengthening Foundational Pillars
Our strategy execution is supported by strengthening our foundational pillars: people, sustainable growth, technology, and facilities. We believe that it is important to continue to invest in and strengthen our foundational pillars to support growth and further differentiate our business strategy.
People. 
We continue to invest in our people through leadership development, our career paths program, technical training for key roles such as drivers and mechanics, and incentive compensation structures that seek to align our employees’ incentives with our long-term goal to improve cash flows and returns on invested capital. As a result of our acquisition activity in fiscal year 2024, which included entry into new markets, we have grown our workforce by over 20% as compared to fiscal year 2023, to over 5,000 employees. Our integration process has focused on welcoming and introducing our culture to new team members as well as providing the necessary resources across all operations. We believe investing in our team and culture, and creating a safe, engaged, and ready workforce is key to our continued success.
Sustainable Growth. 
We are focused on driving further value through profitable new customer growth and the expansion of services with existing customers. Through an integrated effort across our sales, marketing, engagement, customer care, communications, and sustainability functions, we seek to enhance customer profitability and sustainability, improve key customer retention, and further growth within targeted markets. 
We invest in sales training and have developed centralized processes to support and enhance field sales performance that can help advance profitable, scalable growth across the sales organization, while helping to reduce overall sales expenses. We have consistent sales metrics and our compensation programs enhance accountability and alignment across our organization. Our sustainable growth initiatives shape how we interact with our customers and with the communities we serve. 
Technology. 
We

continue to execute a multi-year technology strategy, which includes business systems standardization, post-acquisition integration and a multi-faceted digital customer engagement transformation. We have launched an initiative to consolidate and standardize our core revenue, billing and operational systems (our “Lead to Cash” project), successfully completing a pilot in fiscal year 2024 and transitioning to a planned enterprise rollout in 2025 and 2026. We believe that each milestone in this initiative will create significant business value by streamlining middle and back-office operations, eliminating legacy and acquired technologies, and modernizing our overall capabilities. 
We plan to continue our measured approach to technology transformation, with capital investment in select technologies that are expected to be long-term strategic fits, drive operational efficiencies, and yield measurable business value. 
Facilities. 
We believe prioritizing and allocating capital to meet our long-term facility needs will help to improve employee safety, operating efficiencies, acquisition integration, and employee engagement. Our facility strategy helps to guide decisions related to facility expansions, consolidations, and relocations as well as key property or facility acquisitions. We are focused on facility standards that create a welcoming and accommodating experience for our employees, customers, vendors, and site visitors. These attributes coupled with improved functional design aim to increase the attraction and retention of key roles across our organization.

Table of Contents
Human Capital 
We believe that one of the most important factors in achieving our long-term strategies is to hire, develop, and retain employees who adhere to our c
ore values 
of service, trust, responsibility, integrity, continuous improvement and teamwork (“Core Values”). Our team consists of drivers, vehicle technicians, equipment operators, recycling facility sorters, engineers, accountants, customer care specialists, and many other key roles. 
As of January 31, 2025, we employed approximately 5,100 employees, including approximately 900 managerial, sales, clerical, information systems or other administrative employees and approximately 4,200 employees involved in collection, transfer, disposal, recycling, organics or other operations. Approximately 170 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
Health, Safety and Wellness
A top priority across all of our operations is to protect the health and safety of our team and the communities that we serve. At the heart of our safety program are our safety and operations teams, who are dedicated to ensuring that every employee has a safe operating environment and the necessary training and personal protective equipment to safely conduct their role. Both the success of our safety programs and the performance of our health and safety and operations teams is measured by our total recordable incident rate, a measure of accidents and injuries compared to hours worked. Our extensive focus on new hire and ongoing training programs also helps us to manage and reduce operational risks for our front-line employees.
Compensation and Benefit Programs
We strive to provide the necessary resources to support the physical and mental health of our employees and the overall well-being of their families and the communities that we serve. We aim to achieve this through our benefit programs, caring attitude towards our employees, deep engagement in our communities, and adherence to our Core Values. We are committed to offering high quality benefits at affordable rates, competitive compensation based on role, experience and performance, and a career path program to encourage members of our team to advance throughout their employment with us. We conduct market-based surveys to ensure that our employees continue to be paid competitively, and we perform annual reviews to provide feedback and support the growth and development of members of our team. 
We offer our employees access to enhanced benefits such as a concierge surgery service, telemedicine options, access to a certified clinical pharmacist to support employees in managing their medications and healthcare budget, and online psychology appointments. We understand the importance of work-life balance for our employees and offer eight weeks maternity leave as well as maintain a robust employee assistance program designed to provide support and guidance related to personal life challenges and events. Further, our Employee Life Navigator program is focused on employee retention, career development, and financial stability for at risk employees. Through comprehensive compensation and benefits, ongoing employee development, tuition reimbursement and a focus on health, safety and employee well-being, we seek to help our employees in all aspects of their lives so they can realize their value and do their best work.
People, Culture & Belonging
Our commitment to an inclusive workplace is rooted in our Core Values and our People, Culture & Belonging initiatives. Our vision is to draw on our Core Values to promote inclusion through the following:
•
directing recruiting efforts to new talent pools, promoting inclusion in our training and development programs, and ensuring equal opportunity within our process for advancing our next cohort of leaders; 
•
focusing on ongoing training programs for managers that emphasize people, culture and belonging; and
•
incorporating inclusive practices as part of our ongoing efforts to upgrade our procurement system and practices.
Employee Engagement, Training and Development
We are committed to building people and cultivating engagement by investing in our career path program in order to provide a clear and measurable development pathway for career growth, including the following training initiatives and programs. 
Apprenticeships.
 We have developed an apprenticeship program for drivers and technicians, where we recruit new employees with a broad range of experiences, perspectives, and backgrounds, and help them build the skills they need to thrive in our organization. 
Commercial Driver's License Training. 
We have developed a commercial driver's license (“CDL”) training school and have partnered with several additional training schools across our operating footprint to help develop skilled drivers for our team. Since opening the training school in 2021, we have supported over 300 drivers in securing their CDL, which has unlocked new opportunities for them within our company.

Operations Trainee Program.
 Our operations trainee program develops individuals into frontline management roles. Through on-the-job training, participants learn the technical and leadership skills required to lead our operations. This program has become a strong pipeline for our operating managers across our company. We continue to expand our management development programs across the organization. 
Diesel Mechanic Training.
 Since the launch of our in house Diesel Technician school in fiscal year 2023, we have trained and certified over 200 diesel technicians throughout our organization. We continue to collaborate with technical schools as well as enhance our training infrastructure and resources to attract, develop, and retain skilled diesel mechanics.
We have also increased our focus on Core Values training to support the continued growth of our workforce and ensure that new employees understand our culture and values. This training highlights our commitment to integrating new employees and ensuring that there is continuity in our message about culture within our organization.
Operational Overview
We manage our solid waste operations, which are vertically integrated and include a full range of solid waste services, on a geographic basis through three regional operating segments, which we designate as the Eastern, Western and Mid-Atlantic regions. Within each geographic region, we organize our solid waste services around smaller market areas that we also refer to as “wastesheds.” A wasteshed is an area that comprises the complete cycle of activities in the solid waste services process, from collection to transfer operations and recycling to disposal in landfills, some of which may be owned and/or operated by third parties. We typically operate several divisions within each market area, or wasteshed, each of which provides a particular service, such as collection, recycling, disposal or transfer. Each division operates interdependently with the other divisions within the market area. Each market area generally operates autonomously from adjoining market areas. 
Our Eastern region consists of wastesheds located in Maine, northern, central and southeastern New Hampshire, central and eastern Massachusetts, and eastern Connecticut. We entered into these wastesheds beginning in 1996 and have expanded primarily through acquisitions and organic growth since that time. Our Western region consists of wastesheds located in Vermont, southwestern New Hampshire, western and upstate New York, western Massachusetts, and in Pennsylvania around our McKean Landfill. We began entering into these wastesheds in 1997 and have expanded primarily through tuck-in acquisitions and organic growth since then. We remain focused on increasing our vertical integration in our Western region through extension of our reach into new markets. Our Mid-Atlantic region consists of wastesheds located in eastern Pennsylvania, western New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland. We began entering into these wastesheds in fiscal year 2023 with the completion of the GFL Acquisition.
We manage our resource renewal operations through the Resource Solutions operating segment, which leverages our core competencies in materials processing, industrial recycling, organics and resource management service offerings to deliver a comprehensive solution for our larger commercial, municipal, institutional and industrial customers that have more diverse waste and recycling needs. The Resource Solutions operating segment is not specific to a geography and is organized to leverage our core competencies across our entire business footprint.

Solid Waste Operations 
Solid waste operations within our Eastern, Western and Mid-Atlantic regions consist of a comprehensive range of solid waste services. Our Eastern and Western regions are comprised primarily of solid waste collection, transfer station, and disposal facilities. Revenues derived from our solid waste operations in our Eastern and Western regions consist primarily of fees charged to customers for solid waste collection and disposal services, including landfill, transfer station and transportation, while also providing landfill gas-to-energy and processing services. Our Mid-Atlantic region is comprised of collection facilities and a transfer station facility. Revenues in our Mid-Atlantic region consist primarily of fees charged to customers for solid waste collection and transfer services. We derive a substantial portion of our collection revenues from commercial, industrial and municipal services that are generally performed under service agreements or pursuant to contracts with municipalities. The majority of our residential collection services are performed on a subscription basis with individual property owners or occupants. Landfill and transfer customers are charged a tipping fee on a per ton basis for disposing of their solid waste at our disposal facilities and transfer stations. We also generate and sell electricity, renewable energy credits, and energy capacity payments at certain of our landfill facilities. 
Collection.
 A majority of our commercial and industrial collection services are performed under one-to-five year service agreements, with prices and fees determined by such factors as: collection frequency; type of equipment and containers furnished; type, volume and weight of solid waste collected; distance to the disposal or processing facility; and cost of disposal or processing. Our residential collection services are performed either on a subscription basis (with no underlying contract) with individuals, or through contracts with municipalities, homeowner associations, apartment building owners or mobile home park operators.
Transfer Stations.
 Our transfer stations receive, process and transfer solid waste, collected by our various residential and commercial collection operations along with volumes from various third-party service providers, for transport to disposal facilities by larger vehicles. We believe that transfer stations benefit us by: 
(1)
 increasing the size of the wastesheds which have access to our landfills or third-party disposal facilities; 
(2)
 reducing costs by improving utilization of collection personnel and equipment; and 
(3)
 helping us build relationships with municipalities and other customers by providing a local physical presence and enhanced local service capabilities.
Landfills.
 We operate eight solid waste Subtitle D landfills and one landfill permitted to accept C&D materials. Revenues are received from municipalities and other customers in the form of tipping fees. The estimated capacity at our landfills is subject to change based on engineering factors, requirements of regulatory authorities, our ability to continue to operate our landfills in compliance with applicable regulations and our ability to successfully renew operating permits and obtain expansion permits at our sites. 
The following table (in thousands) reflects the aggregate landfill capacity and airspace changes, in tons, for landfills we operated during fiscal year 2024, fiscal year 2023 and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, (“fiscal year 2022”):

The variation in changes in airspace capacity associated with engineering estimates are primarily the result of changes in compaction at our landfills and estimated airspace changes associated with design changes at certain of our landfills.
Our Eastern region consists of the following Subtitle D landfills located in Bethlehem, New Hampshire (“NCES Landfill”) and West Old Town, Maine (“Juniper Ridge Landfill”):
NCES Landfill.
 The NCES Landfill is a Subtitle D landfill located in Bethlehem, New Hampshire that we purchased in 1994. The NCES Landfill currently consists of approximately 52 acres of permitted or permittable landfill area, and is permitted to accept 0.23 million cubic yards of municipal solid waste, C&D material and certain pre-approved special wastes annually. Based on capacity remaining under its existing permit, we expect the NCES Landfill to stop accepting waste by the end of 2027. We are party to an agreement for the construction of a landfill renewable natural gas (“RNG”) facility, which will be constructed, owned and operated by a third party.
Juniper Ridge Landfill.
 The Juniper Ridge Landfill is a Subtitle D landfill located in West Old Town, Maine. In 2004, we completed transactions with the State of Maine and Georgia-Pacific Corporation (“Georgia Pacific”), pursuant to which the State of Maine took ownership of the Juniper Ridge Landfill, formerly owned by Georgia Pacific, and we became the operator under a 30-year operating and services agreement between us and the State of Maine. The Juniper Ridge Landfill currently consists of approximately 150 acres of permitted or permittable landfill area, which is sufficient to permit the additional airspace required for the term of the 30-year operating and services agreement, and is permitted to accept the following waste originating from the State of Maine: C&D material, ash from municipal solid waste incinerators and fossil fuel boilers, front end processed residuals and bypass municipal solid waste from waste-to-energy facilities and certain pre-approved special waste. Outside of the limitations on municipal solid waste, there are no annual tonnage limitations at the Juniper Ridge Landfill. We are party to an agreement for the construction of a landfill RNG facility plant at the Juniper Ridge Landfill, which was constructed, and now owned and operated by a third party.
Our Western region consists of the following Subtitle D landfills located in Coventry, Vermont (“Waste USA Landfill”), Morrisonville, New York (“Clinton County Landfill”), Angelica, New York (“Hyland Landfill”), Seneca, New York (“Ontario County Landfill”), Chemung, New York (“Chemung County Landfill”) and the McKean Landfill, and a C&D landfill located in Campbell, New York (“Hakes Landfill”):

 The Chemung County Landfill is a Subtitle D landfill located in Chemung, New York. In 2005, we entered into a 25-year operation, management and lease agreement for the Chemung County Landfill and certain other facilities with Chemung County. Chemung County Landfill currently consists of approximately 132 acres of permitted or permittable landfill area strategically situated to accept long haul volume from both eastern and downstate New York markets and is permitted to accept up to 0.4 million tons of municipal solid waste and certain pre-approved special waste annually and 20.5 thousand tons of C&D material annually. In 2016, we received an expansion permit at the Chemung County Landfill, which is sufficient to permit the additional airspace required for the remaining term of the 25-year operation, management and lease agreement. In 2019, we exercised an option to extend the remaining term of the operation, management and lease agreement for up to five years through 2035. We are party to an agreement for the construction of a landfill RNG facility plant at the Chemung County Landfill, which will be constructed, owned and operated by a third party.
McKean Landfill.
 The McKean Landfill is a Subtitle D landfill located in Mount Jewett, Pennsylvania that we purchased in 2011. The McKean Landfill currently consists of approximately 256 acres of permitted or permittable landfill area and is permitted to accept up to approximately 1.6 million tons of municipal solid waste, C&D material and certain pre-approved special waste annually. We have invested capital in the development of rail infrastructure to expand the market reach for the landfill to rail capable transfer facilities, and began accepting waste deliveries by rail in fiscal year 2024. We are party to an agreement for the construction of a landfill RNG facility plant at the McKean Landfill, which will be constructed, owned and operated by a third party.
Our closed landfills consist of the following landfills:
In 2017, we initiated a plan to cease operations of the Town of Southbridge, Massachusetts landfill (“Southbridge Landfill”) and decided to not proceed with expansion efforts and to close the Southbridge Landfill once the remaining capacity had been exhausted, which occurred in 2018. As of August 2024, the landfill is fully closed and has entered into its post-closure period. The site houses a landfill gas-to-energy facility, which we own, but is operated by a third party, that has the capacity to generate 1.6 MW of energy.
In addition to the Southbridge Landfill, we own and/or manage five unlined landfills and three lined landfills that are not currently in operation. We have closed and capped all of these landfills according to applicable environmental regulatory standards. 
Resource Solutions 
Our Resource Solutions operating segment was formed to leverage our core competencies in materials processing, industrial recycling, organics and resource management service offerings in order to generate additional value from the waste stream for larger commercial, municipal, institutional and industrial customers with more diverse needs. Resource Solutions services are comprised of processing services and our National Accounts business. We also work to develop and/or partner with firms that have developed innovative approaches to deriving incremental value from the organic portion of the waste stream.
Processing.
 Processing services consist of the receipt of recycled, sludge or other organic materials at one of our materials recovery, processing or disposal facilities, where it is then sorted, mixed and/or processed, and then repurposed, disposed of or sold. Revenues from processing services are derived from municipalities and customers in the form of processing fees, tipping fees, and commodity sales, primarily comprised of newspaper, corrugated containers, plastics, ferrous and aluminum, and organic materials such as our earthlife

We are one of the largest processors and marketers of recycled materials in the northeastern United States with facilities located in Vermont, New York, Maine, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania, including our eight large-scale, high volume MRFs, which utilize sophisticated processing operations, two of which are located in New York, two of which are located in Vermont, two of which are located in Massachusetts, one of which is located in Connecticut and one of which is located in Maine. Three of the eight MRFs are leased, four are owned, and one is operated by us under a contract with a municipal third party. Our MRFs receive, sort, bale and sell recyclable materials originating from the municipal solid waste stream, including newsprint, cardboard, office paper, glass, plastic, steel or aluminum containers and bottles. We also operate smaller MRFs, which generally process recyclables collected from our various residential and commercial collection operations. 
A substantial portion of the recyclable materials provided is delivered pursuant to multiple long-term anchor contracts. The terms of the recycling contracts vary, but all of the contracts provide that the municipality or a third party delivers the recycled materials to our facility. These contracts may include a minimum volume guarantee by the municipality. We also have service agreements with individual towns and cities and commercial customers, including small solid waste companies and major competitors, which do not have processing capacity within a specific geographic region. Under the recycling contracts, we charge the municipality a fee for each ton of material delivered to us. Some contracts contain revenue sharing arrangements under which the municipality receives a specified percentage of our revenues from the sale of the recovered materials if certain economic thresholds are met. In fiscal year 2024, we processed and/or marketed over 1.1 million tons of recyclable materials, including tons marketed through our National Accounts business commodity brokerage division and our baling facilities located throughout our footprint. 
The pricing for recyclable materials can fluctuate based upon market conditions. We have actively worked to reduce our risk exposure to commodity pricing volatility through our efforts to shift customers to a processing fee model and other risk management programs. We effectively manage commodity pricing volatility through our long-term revenue sharing (or processing fee) contracts with customers. Under such contracts, we obtain a guaranteed minimum price for recyclable materials through the receipt of a tipping or processing fee when commodity prices fall below agreed upon thresholds. Conversely, when prices for recyclable materials rise above agreed upon thresholds, we provide the counterparty with a portion of the related revenues above such threshold. Also, we mitigate the impact from commodity price fluctuations through the use of a floating SRA Fee charged to collection customers to reduce recycling commodity risk. Further, we work to manage commodity pricing risk through commodity sales contracts with large domestic companies that use the recyclable materials in their manufacturing process, such as paper, packaging and consumer goods companies. 
The global recycling market experiences volatility due to changes in economic conditions and numerous other factors beyond our control. Recycling commodity price volatility resulted in near record highs in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 followed by near record lows in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022. See Item 7A. “

National Accounts.
 Our National Accounts business consists of brokerage services and overall resource management services, which provide a wide range of environmental services and resource management solutions to large and complex organizations, as well as traditional collection, disposal and recycling services provided to large account multi-site customers. In brokerage arrangements, we act as an agent that facilitates the sale of recyclable and organic materials between an inbound customer and an outbound customer. Revenues from the brokerage of recycled materials are recognized on a net basis at the time of shipment. In general, these fees are variable in nature. In overall resource management services, we work with larger scale commercial or industrial organizations (including multi-location customers, colleges and universities, municipalities, and industrial customers) to develop customized solid waste and recycling solutions. The focus of this business is to help these large-scale organizations achieve their economic and environmental objectives related to waste and residual management. We strive to differentiate our services from our competitors by providing customized and comprehensive resource solutions, which enables us to win new business, including traditional solid waste collection and disposal customers.

Competition
The solid waste services industry is competitive and requires substantial labor and capital resources. Our business strategy generally focuses on operating in secondary or tertiary markets where we often have a strong market presence. However, in the larger, more densely populated markets where we operate, we typically compete against one or more of the large national solid waste companies, including Waste Management, Inc., Republic Services, Inc. and Waste Connections, Inc., any of which may be able to achieve greater economies of scale than we can. We also compete with a number of regional and local companies that offer competitive prices and quality service. We compete primarily on the basis of the quality, breadth and price of our services. This includes our Resource Solutions operating segment, from which we strive to leverage our core competencies in materials processing, industrial recycling, organics, and resource management service offerings to deliver a comprehensive solution for our larger commercial, municipal, institutional and industrial customers that have more diverse solid waste and recycling needs. In addition, we compete with operators of alternative disposal facilities, including incinerators; with certain municipalities, counties and districts that operate their own solid waste collection and disposal facilities; and with rail-serviced transfer stations that use rail to transport waste to disposal sites primarily located outside of our operational footprint. Public sector facilities may have certain advantages over us due to the availability of user fees, charges or tax revenues.
From time to time, competitors may reduce the price of their services to attract additional customers or to win a competitively bid solid waste or recycling contract. These practices may also lead to reduced pricing for our services or the loss of business. In addition, competition exists within the industry for potential acquisition candidates.
Sales and Marketing
We have aligned our sales and marketing strategies with our customer-facing teams - Customer Care, Business Development, Sales Operations, Marketing, Community Engagement, and Sustainability - to better serve our customers while delivering on several key strategic initiatives for sustainable growth.
As a part of our resource management offering, we serve customers with multiple locations and are focused on growing our number of municipal, institutional, commercial and industrial customers. We leverage broader service offerings of the Resource Solutions operating segment to provide customers with a full set of solutions to augment our regional and divisional service capabilities.
While we continue to provide traditional waste and recycling services locally, our differentiated sustainable resource management approach aims to meet our customers’ unique needs and strives to deliver value beyond competitors in local markets. We value and embrace the uniqueness of our local communities above the homogeneity of corporate process, while encouraging and supporting our local managers to engage with local government, non-profits, and business organizations. 
Deep community engagement, supported by modern corporate brand governance and strategy gives us the flexibility needed to serve today’s customers and support communities. A combination of enterprise sustainability goals and efforts, strong brand placements, and marketing tactics are designed to unify and humanize our company while retaining existing customers and attracting new ones.
Risk Management, Insurance and Performance or Surety Bonds
We actively maintain environmental and other risk management programs that we believe are appropriate for our business. Our environmental risk management program includes evaluating existing facilities, as well as potential acquisitions, for compliance with environmental law requirements. Operating practices across all of our operations are intended to reduce the possibility of environmental contamination, enforcement actions and litigation. We also maintain a worker safety program, which focuses on safe practices in the workplace.
We carry a range of insurance intended to protect our assets and operations, including a commercial general liability policy and a property damage policy. A partially or completely uninsured claim against us (including liabilities associated with cleanup or remediation at our facilities), if successful and of sufficient magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Due primarily to market factors beyond our control, the insurance market is increasingly restrictive, potentially limiting our ability to obtain adequate coverage at reasonable prices, if at all. Any future difficulty in obtaining insurance could also impair our ability to secure future contracts, which may be conditioned upon the availability of adequate insurance coverage. See Item 1A. “
Risk Factors
” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further disclosure. 
We also self-insure for automobile and workers’ compensation coverage with reinsurance coverage limiting our maximum exposure. In fiscal year 2024, our maximum exposure per individual event under the workers’ compensation plan was $1.50 million. In fiscal year 2024, our minimum and maximum exposure per individual event under the automobile plan were up to $2.00 million and $4.20 million, respectively.

Municipal solid waste collection contracts and landfill closure and post-closure obligations may require performance or surety bonds, letters of credit or other means of financial assurance to secure contractual performance. While we have not experienced difficulty in obtaining these financial instruments, if we are unable to obtain these financial instruments in sufficient amounts or at acceptable rates, we could be precluded from entering into additional municipal contracts or obtaining or retaining landfill operating permits.
We hold a 19.9% ownership interest in Evergreen National Indemnity Company (“Evergreen”), a surety company which provides surety bonds to secure our contractual obligations for certain municipal solid waste collection contracts and landfill closure and post-closure obligations. Our ownership interest in Evergreen is pledged to Evergreen as security for our obligations under the bonds they provide on our behalf.
Customers
We provide solid waste and recycling services to commercial, municipal, institutional, industrial and residential customers. A majority of our commercial and industrial collection and disposal services are performed under one-to-five year service agreements. Our residential collection and disposal services are performed either on a subscription basis (with no underlying contract) with individuals, or through contracts with municipalities, homeowners' associations, apartment owners or mobile home park operators. Our price for the services performed is determined by such factors as: professional or management services required; collection frequency and the related operational costs; type of equipment and containers furnished; the type, volume and weight of the solid waste, recyclables or organics collected; the distance to the disposal or processing facility; and the cost of disposal or processing. 
In addition to our collection and disposal services, through our Resource Solution segment we provide recycling processing services to municipalities, commercial haulers and commercial waste generators within the geographic proximity of the processing facilities. We also provide brokerage services and overall resource management services, through a wide range of environmental service offerings, to large and complex organizations, as well as traditional collection, disposal and recycling services to large account multi-site customers.
Seasonality and Severe Weather
Our revenues historically have been higher in the late spring, summer and early fall months. This seasonality reflects lower volumes of waste in the late fall, winter and early spring months because the volume of waste relating to C&D activities decreases substantially during the winter months in the eastern United States.
Our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement or severe weather, which may increase with the physical impacts of climate change and could increase our operating costs associated with the collection and disposal of waste, delay the collection and disposal of waste, reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites, increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts (without corresponding compensation), decrease the throughput and operating efficiency of our materials recycling facilities, or delay construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities. Our operations can also be favorably affected by severe weather, which could increase the volume of waste in situations where we are able to charge for our additional services provided. 
Regulation
Introduction
Our facilities and operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local requirements that regulate, among other things, the environment, public health, safety, zoning and land use. In order to transport, process, or dispose of solid waste, it is necessary for us to possess and comply with one or more permits from federal, state and/or local agencies. We must renew these permits periodically, and the permits may be modified or revoked by the issuing agency under certain circumstances. We are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations. The laws and regulations affecting us are administered by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and other federal, state and local environmental, zoning, financial, health and safety agencies.
In order to comply with these regulations, we must incur substantial capital expenditures relating to our vehicles, landfills, transfer stations, and recycling processing centers, and in connection with our final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation activities. Compliance with existing and future legal and regulatory requirements, including changes relating to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (commonly referred to as “PFAS”) and other chemicals of emerging concern, and limitations or bans on disposal of certain types of wastes or on the transportation of waste, could increase our costs to operate or require additional capital expenditures. Failure to comply with such requirements could result in substantial costs or penalties, including civil and criminal fines and penalties.

Table of Contents
We strive to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws, regulations and permits. However, from time to time we have been issued citations or notices from governmental authorities that have resulted in the need to expend funds for remedial work and related activities at various landfills and other facilities or in the need to expend funds for fines, penalties or settlements. Citations and notices may be issued in the future, notwithstanding our strong regulatory compliance efforts. 
Except as described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable federal, state and local environmental laws, permits, orders and regulations. Other than as disclosed herein, we do not currently anticipate any material costs to bring our existing operations into environmental compliance, although there can be no assurance in this regard for the future. We expect that our operations in the solid waste services industry will be subject to continued and increased regulation, legislation and enforcement oversight. We attempt to anticipate future legal and regulatory requirements and to keep our operations in compliance with those requirements.
The principal federal statutes and regulations applicable to our operations are as follows:
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended (“RCRA”)
The RCRA regulates the generation, treatment, storage, handling, transportation and disposal of solid waste and requires states to develop programs to ensure the safe disposal of solid waste. The RCRA divides waste into two categories, hazardous and non-hazardous. Wastes are generally classified as hazardous if they either (a) are specifically included on a list of hazardous wastes, or (b) exhibit certain characteristics defined as hazardous and are not specifically designated as non-hazardous. Wastes classified as hazardous waste are subject to more extensive regulation than wastes classified as non-hazardous, and businesses that deal with hazardous waste are subject to regulatory obligations in addition to those imposed on businesses that deal with non-hazardous waste.
Among the wastes that are specifically designated as non-hazardous are household waste and “special” waste, including items such as petroleum contaminated soils, asbestos, foundry sand, shredder fluff and most non-hazardous industrial waste products.
The EPA regulations issued under Subtitle C of the RCRA impose a comprehensive “cradle to grave” system for tracking the generation, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes. Subtitle C regulations impose obligations on generators, transporters and disposers of hazardous wastes, and require permits that are costly to obtain and maintain for sites where those businesses treat, store or dispose of such material. Subtitle C requirements include detailed operating, inspection, training and emergency preparedness and response standards, as well as requirements for manifesting, record keeping and reporting, corrective action, facility closure, post-closure and financial responsibility. Most states have promulgated regulations modeled on some or all of the Subtitle C provisions issued by the EPA, and in many instances the EPA has delegated to those states the principal role in regulating businesses which are subject to those requirements. Some state regulations impose obligations different from and in addition to those the EPA imposes under Subtitle C.
Leachate generated at our landfills and transfer stations is tested on a regular basis, and generally is not regulated as a hazardous waste under federal law. However, there is no guarantee that leachate generated from our facilities in the future will not be classified as hazardous waste.
In October 1991, the EPA adopted the Subtitle D regulations under RCRA governing solid waste landfills. The Subtitle D regulations, which generally became effective in October 1993, include siting restrictions, facility design standards, operating criteria, closure and post-closure requirements, financial assurance requirements, groundwater monitoring requirements, groundwater remediation standards and corrective action requirements. In addition, the Subtitle D regulations require that new landfill sites meet more stringent liner design criteria (typically, composite soil and synthetic liners or two or more synthetic liners) intended to keep leachate out of groundwater and have extensive collection systems to carry away leachate for treatment prior to disposal. Regulations generally require us to install groundwater monitoring wells at virtually all landfills we operate, to monitor groundwater quality and, indirectly, the effectiveness of the leachate collection systems. The Subtitle D regulations also require facility owners or operators to control emissions of landfill gas (including methane) generated at landfills exceeding certain regulatory thresholds. State landfill regulations must meet those requirements or the EPA will impose such requirements upon landfill owners and operators in that state.

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended (“Clean Water Act”)
The Clean Water Act regulates the discharge of pollutants into “navigable waters” or “waters of the United States” from a variety of sources, including solid waste disposal sites and transfer stations, processing facilities and waste-to-energy facilities (collectively, “solid waste management facilities”). If pollutants from our solid waste management facilities are discharged into streams, rivers or other surface waters, or if there is a functional equivalent of a direct discharge into navigable waters, the Clean Water Act would require us to apply for and obtain a discharge permit, conduct sampling and monitoring and, under certain circumstances, reduce the quantity of pollutants in such discharge. A permit also may be required if run-off or leachate from our solid waste management facilities is discharged to an offsite treatment facility. Almost all solid waste management facilities must comply with the EPA’s storm water regulations, which govern the discharge of regulated storm water to surface waters.
Under federal regulation, facilities that have above ground and/or below ground petroleum storage capacities over certain thresholds may be subject to regulations and/or permitting under the Clean Water Act. Many of our facilities have petroleum storage and are required to have a spill, prevention, control and countermeasures plan to prevent petroleum release to waters of the United States due to a spill, rupture or leak.
Several states in which we operate have been delegated the authority to implement the Clean Water Act requirements and in some cases the regulations are more stringent than the federal regulations. We believe we are in compliance with the Clean Water Act regulations; however future changes to the law or regulations could have a material impact on our business.
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (“CERCLA”)
CERCLA established a regulatory and remedial program intended to provide for the investigation and remediation of facilities where, or from which, a release of any hazardous substance into the environment has occurred or is threatened. CERCLA has been interpreted to impose retroactive, strict, and under certain circumstances, joint and severable, liability for the costs to investigate and clean up facilities on current owners and operators of the site, former owners and operators of the site at the time of the disposal of the hazardous substances, as well as the generators and certain transporters of the hazardous substances. CERCLA imposes liability for the costs of evaluating and addressing damage to natural resources. The costs of CERCLA investigation and cleanup can be substantial. Liability under CERCLA does not depend upon the existence or disposal of “hazardous waste” as defined by RCRA, but can be based on the presence of any of approximately 800 “hazardous substances” listed by the EPA, many of which can be found in household waste. The definition of “hazardous substances” in CERCLA incorporates substances designated as hazardous or toxic under the Federal Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act and Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”). In April 2024, the EPA designated two PFAS -- perfluorooctanoic acid (“PFOA”) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (“PFOS”), and their salts and structural isomers -- as hazardous substances under CERCLA. If we were found to be a responsible party for a CERCLA cleanup, under certain circumstances, the enforcing agency could pursue us or any other responsible party, for all investigative and remedial costs, even if others also were liable. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA to impose a lien in favor of the United States upon all real property subject to, or affected by, a remedial action for all costs for which the property owner is liable. CERCLA provides a responsible party with the right to bring a contribution action against other responsible parties for their allocable share of investigative and remedial costs. Our ability to obtain reimbursement for amounts we pay in excess of our allocable share of such costs would be limited by our ability to identify and locate other responsible parties and to prove the extent of their responsibility and by the financial resources of such other parties.
The Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended (“Clean Air Act”)
The Clean Air Act, generally through state implementation of federal requirements, regulates emissions of air pollutants from certain landfills based upon the date the landfill was constructed, the total capacity of the landfill and the annual volume of emissions. The EPA has promulgated new source performance standards regulating air emissions of certain regulated pollutants (non-methane organic compounds) from municipal solid waste landfills. Landfills located in areas where ambient levels of regulated pollutants exceed certain thresholds may be subject to more extensive air pollution controls and emission limitations. In addition, the EPA has issued standards regulating the disposal of asbestos-containing materials under the Clean Air Act.
The EPA is also focusing on the emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHG”), including carbon dioxide and methane. In December 2009, the EPA issued its “endangerment finding” that carbon dioxide poses a threat to human health and welfare, providing the basis for the EPA to regulate GHG emissions. In December 2009, the EPA’s “Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases” rule went into effect, requiring facilities that emit twenty-five thousand metric tons or more per year of GHG emissions to submit annual reports to the EPA.
16
Table of Contents
In May 2010, the EPA issued the so-called “GHG Tailoring Rule”, which described how certain sources that emit GHG would be subject to heightened Clean Air Act Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) / Title V regulation. In June 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision partially invalidating the GHG Tailoring Rule and in 2015, the D.C. Circuit directed the EPA to consider further revisions to its regulations. In August 2016, the EPA proposed revisions to PSD and Title V regulations to clarify when sources would require permits based on GHG thresholds. We do not know whether or when the EPA will finalize regulations, or what obligations such regulations will impose on our operations.
In July 2024, the EPA announced that it will issue a proposed rule in 2025 to update its Clean Air Act emission standards for new and existing municipal solid waste landfills in order to cut methane and certain other landfill gas emissions.

We do not know whether or when the EPA will propose this rule, or what obligations such a rule will impose on our operations.
The adoption of other laws and regulations, which may include the imposition of fees or taxes, could adversely affect our collection and disposal operations. Additionally, certain of the states in which we operate are implementing air pollution control regulations, including regional cap and trade systems, relating to GHG that may be more stringent than regulations the EPA may promulgate. Several states have passed Climate Protection or Global Warming Acts intended to achieve statewide goals in reduction of GHG emissions. Changing environmental regulations could require us to take any number of actions, including purchasing emission allowances, developing mitigation strategies, or installing additional pollution control technology, and could make some operations less profitable, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
Congress has considered various options, including a cap and trade system, which could impose a limit on and establish a pricing mechanism for GHG emissions and emission allowances. There also is pressure for the United States to join international efforts to control GHG emissions.
The Clean Air Act regulates emissions of air pollutants from our processing facilities. The EPA has enacted standards that apply to those emissions. It is possible that the EPA, or a state where we operate, will enact additional or different emission standards in the future.
All of the federal statutes described above authorize lawsuits by private citizens to enforce certain provisions of the statutes. In addition to a penalty award to the United States, some of those statutes authorize an award of attorney’s fees to private parties successfully advancing such an action.
The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended (“OSHA”)
OSHA establishes employer responsibilities and authorizes the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to promulgate and enforce occupational health and safety standards, including the obligation to maintain a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious injury, to comply with adopted worker protection standards, to maintain certain records, to provide workers with required disclosures and to implement certain health and safety training programs. A variety of those promulgated standards may apply to our operations, including those standards concerning notices of hazards, safety in excavation and demolition work, the handling of asbestos and asbestos-containing materials, and worker training and emergency response programs.
The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, As Amended (“PURPA”)
PURPA exempts qualifying facilities from most federal and state laws governing the financial organization and rate regulation of electric utilities, and generally requires electric utilities to purchase electricity generated by qualifying facilities at a price equal to the utility’s full “avoided cost”. Our landfill gas-to-energy facilities are self-certified as “qualifying facilities”.
State and Local Regulations
Each state in which we now operate or may operate in the future has laws and regulations governing (1) water and air pollution, and the generation, storage, treatment, handling, processing, transportation, incineration and disposal of solid waste and hazardous waste; (2) in most cases, the siting, design, operation, maintenance, closure and post-closure maintenance of solid waste management facilities; and (3) in some cases, vehicle emissions limits or fuel types, which impact our collection operations. Such standards typically are as stringent as and may be more stringent and broader in scope than, federal regulations. Most of the federal statutes noted above authorize states to enact and enforce laws with standards that are more protective of the environment than the federal analog. In addition, many states have adopted statutes comparable to, and in some cases more stringent than, CERCLA. Those statutes impose requirements for investigation and remediation of contaminated sites and liability for costs and damages associated with such sites, and some authorize the state to impose liens to secure costs expended addressing contamination on property owned by responsible parties. Some of those liens may take priority over previously filed instruments. Some states have enacted statutes that impose liability for substances in addition to the “hazardous substances” listed by the EPA under CERCLA.

Table of Contents
Many municipalities in which we currently operate or may operate in the future also have ordinances, laws and regulations affecting our operations. These include zoning and health measures that limit solid waste management activities to specified sites or conduct, flow control provisions that direct the delivery of solid wastes to specific facilities or to facilities in specific areas, laws that grant the right to establish franchises for collection services and then put out for bid the right to provide collection services, and bans or other restrictions on the movement of solid wastes into a municipality.
Some states have enacted laws that allow agencies with jurisdiction over waste management facilities to deny or revoke permits based on the applicant’s or permit holder’s compliance status. Some states also consider the compliance history of the corporate parent, subsidiaries and affiliates of the applicant or permit holder.
Certain permits and approvals issued under state or local law may limit the types of waste that may be accepted at a solid waste management facility or the quantity of waste that may be accepted at a solid waste management facility during a specific time period. In addition, certain permits and approvals, as well as certain state and local regulations, may limit a solid waste management facility to accepting waste that originates from specified geographic areas or seek to restrict the importation of out-of-state waste or otherwise discriminate against out-of-state waste. Generally, restrictions on importing out-of-state waste have not withstood judicial challenge. However, occasionally federal legislation is proposed which would allow individual states to prohibit the disposal of out-of-state waste or to limit the amount of out-of-state waste that could be imported for disposal and would require states, under certain circumstances, to reduce the amounts of waste exported to other states. Although such legislation has not been passed by Congress, if similar legislation is enacted, states in which we operate solid waste management facilities could limit or prohibit the importation of out-of-state waste. Such actions could materially and adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of any of our solid waste management facilities within those states that receive a significant portion of waste originating from out-of-state.
Certain states and localities may restrict the export of waste from their jurisdiction or require that a specified amount of waste be disposed of at facilities within their jurisdiction. In 1994, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected as unconstitutional and therefore invalid, a local ordinance that sought to limit waste going out of the locality by imposing a requirement that the waste be delivered to a particular privately-owned facility. However, in 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a U.S. District Court ruling that the flow control regulations in Oneida and Herkimer counties in New York requiring trash haulers to use publicly-owned transfer stations are constitutional, and therefore valid. Additionally, certain state and local jurisdictions continue to seek to enforce such restrictions. Some proposed federal legislation would allow states and localities to impose flow restrictions. Those restrictions could reduce the volume of waste going to solid waste management facilities in certain areas, which may materially adversely affect our ability to operate our facilities and/or affect the prices we can charge for certain services. Those restrictions also may result in higher disposal costs for our collection operations. Flow control restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
There has been an increasing trend at the state and local levels to mandate or encourage both waste reduction at the source and waste recycling, and to prohibit or restrict the disposal in landfills of certain types of solid wastes, including yard wastes and leaves, certain construction or architectural wastes, food wastes, beverage containers, newspapers, household appliances and electronics such as computers, and batteries. Regulations reducing the volume and types of wastes available for transport to and disposal in landfills could affect our ability to operate our landfill facilities. Vermont, for example, enacted Act 148, containing among other things, a phased waste ban for recyclables, organics and leaf/yard waste. The law became effective July 1, 2012, with phased deadlines for compliance beginning 2014 through 2020. Vermont also passed a law requiring recycling of architectural waste from construction or demolition of a commercial project. The law became effective in January 2015.
On November 1, 2022, new waste ban regulations took effect in Massachusetts, adding mattresses and textiles as materials banned from disposal or transport for disposal in Massachusetts, and lowering the threshold on commercial organic/food waste to facilities generating more than one-half ton of these materials per week.
New York State revised its regulations governing solid waste management, 6 NYCRR Part 360, effective in November 2017. The revised regulations, among other things, include requirements to conduct landfill liner integrity testing and install radiation detectors at certain facilities. New York has also enacted the Food Donation and Food Scraps Recycling Law, requiring certain generators to separate and donate or recycle food scraps as of January 2022.
Although there is no federal law governing extended producer responsibility (“EPR”) regulations, many states have implemented or are contemplating EPR regulations for certain products. EPR regulations are intended to place responsibility on manufacturers for ultimate management or end-of-useful-life handling of the products they create. In addition to financial responsibility, an EPR program may include responsibility for local take-back or recycling programs. For example, several states in which we operate have EPR regulations for electronic waste. In 2021, the Maine Legislature passed EPR legislation for packaging, and rulemaking commenced in 2022. If broad EPR laws or regulations continue to be adopted, and are managed under a manufacturer implemented program, it could have an impact on our business.
The EPA and environmental agencies within individual states in which we operate continue to consider and promulgate changes to water quality standards, action levels, remediation goals, and other federal or state regulatory standards for

individual compounds or classes of compounds. These changes include the development of new or more stringent standards for “Emerging Contaminants”, including PFAS, pharmaceutical compounds, and a variety of synthetic chemical compounds used in manufacturing and industrial processes. In December 2016, the EPA designated ten chemical substances for risk evaluations under TSCA, and in December 2019, the EPA designated an additional 20 chemical substances for risk evaluation, based on the requirements of the June 2016 Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act. In April 2024, the EPA set legally enforceable levels, called Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs), for six PFAS in drinking water. Also in April 2024, the EPA designated two PFAS -- PFOA and PFOS, and their salts and structural isomers -- as hazardous substances under CERCLA. Changes in regulatory standards for existing or emerging contaminants can result in higher levels of cost and effort associated with the performance of environmental investigations and ongoing compliance at our facilities.
