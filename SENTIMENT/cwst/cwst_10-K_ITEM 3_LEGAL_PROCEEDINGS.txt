Discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (“fiscal year 2023”) compared to our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 is included under the heading Item 7. “
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 16, 2024.
Company Overview
Casella Waste Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, “we”, “us” or “our”), is a regional, vertically integrated solid waste services company. We provide resource management expertise and services to residential, commercial, municipal, institutional and industrial customers, primarily in the areas of solid waste collection and disposal, transfer, recycling and organics services. 
We provide integrated solid waste services in ten states: Vermont, New Hampshire, New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maine, Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey and Maryland, with our headquarters located in Rutland, Vermont. We manage our solid waste operations on a geographic basis through three regional operating segments, the Eastern, Western and Mid-Atlantic regions, each of which provides a comprehensive range of non-hazardous solid waste services. We manage our resource renewal operations through the Resource Solutions operating segment, which leverages our core competencies in materials processing, industrial recycling, organics and resource management service offerings to deliver a comprehensive solution for our larger commercial, municipal, institutional and industrial customers that have more diverse waste and recycling needs. Legal, tax, information technology, human resources, certain finance and accounting and other administrative functions are included in our Corporate Entities segment.
For financial information concerning our reportable operating segments refer to Note 20. 
Segment Reporting 
to our consolidated financial statements included under “Item 8. 
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
As of January 31, 2025, we owned and/or operated 71 solid waste collection operations, 71 transfer stations, 28 recycling and processing facilities, eight Subtitle D landfills, three landfill gas-to-energy facilities and one landfill permitted to accept construction and demolition materials.
Acquisitions and Divestitures
Acquisitions
We have made in the past, and we expect to make in the future, acquisitions to densify existing operations, expand service areas, and grow services for our customers. These acquisitions may include “tuck-in” acquisitions within our existing markets, assets that are adjacent to or outside of our existing markets, or larger, more strategic acquisitions. In addition, from time to time, we may acquire businesses that are complementary to our core business strategy. We face competition for acquisition targets, particularly the larger and more meaningful targets, but we believe that our strong relationships and reputation help to offset this factor.
We have a business development team that identifies acquisition candidates, categorizes the opportunity by strategic fit and financial synergies, establishes contact with the appropriate representative of the acquisition candidate and gathers further information on the acquisition candidate.
In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 (“fiscal year 2024”), we acquired eight businesses: four of which are in our Mid-Atlantic region, including the purchase of all the equity interests of Whitetail Disposal, Inc. and the assets of LMR Disposal, LLC, which together include collection operations in eastern Pennsylvania and western New Jersey; two of which are in our Western region, including the purchase of all equity interests of Royal Carting and Welsh Sanitation and related real estate assets, which consist of collection and transfer operations in the middle and lower Hudson Valley regions of New York as well as western Connecticut; and two of which are tuck-in operations in our Eastern region. Our total consideration for acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2024 was $467.9 million, including $469.2 in cash, $1.7 million in holdbacks and additional consideration owed, partially offset by $(3.0) million of open working capital settlements due from sellers.
In fiscal year 2023, we acquired seven businesses: the equity interests of four wholly-owned subsidiaries of GFL Environmental Inc., which include solid waste collection, transfer and recycling operations in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Delaware (the “GFL Acquisition”); the assets of Consolidated Waste Services, LLC and its affiliates (dba Twin Bridges), consisting of a collection, transfer and recycling business in the greater Albany, New York area (the “Twin Bridges Acquisition”); and five additional solid waste collection businesses that provide collection, transfer and recycling services. Our total consideration for acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2023 was $846.6 million, including $846.7 in cash, $2.7 million in holdbacks and additional consideration owed to sellers, partially offset by $(2.8) million of open working capital settlements due from sellers, that has subsequently been received.

Divestitures
From time to time, we may sell or divest certain investments or other components of our business. These divestitures may be undertaken for a number of reasons, including: to generate proceeds to pay down debt; as a result of a determination that the specified asset will provide inadequate returns to us or that the asset no longer serves a strategic purpose in connection with our business; or as a result of a determination that the asset may be more valuable to a third party. We will continue to look to divest certain activities and investments that no longer enhance or complement our core business if the right opportunity presents itself.
Results of Operations 
Revenues
We manage our solid waste operations, which include a full range of solid waste services, on a geographic basis through three regional operating segments, which we designate as the Eastern, Western and Mid-Atlantic regions. Revenues associated with our solid waste operations are derived mainly from fees charged to customers for solid waste collection and disposal services, including landfill, transfer station and transportation, while also providing landfill gas-to-energy and processing services in the eastern United States. We derive a substantial portion of our collection revenues from commercial, industrial and municipal services that are generally performed under service agreements or pursuant to contracts with municipalities. The majority of our residential collection services are performed on a subscription basis with individual property owners or occupants. Landfill and transfer customers are charged a tipping fee on a per ton basis for disposing of their solid waste at our disposal facilities and transfer stations. We also generate and sell electricity at certain of our landfill facilities. We manage our resource renewal operations through the Resource Solutions operating segment, which includes processing services and services provided by our National Accounts business. Revenues from processing services are derived from customers in the form of processing fees, tipping fees, commodity sales, primarily comprised of newspaper, corrugated containers, plastics, ferrous and aluminum, and organic materials such as our earthlife® soils products including fertilizers, composts and mulches. Revenues from our National Accounts business are derived from brokerage services and overall resource management services providing a wide range of environmental services and resource management solutions to large and complex organizations, as well as traditional collection, disposal and recycling services provided to large account multi-site customers.

The most significant items impacting the change in our solid waste revenues during fiscal year 2024 are summarized below:
•
Price increased solid waste revenues due to (i) $46.1 million, or 6.5% as a percentage of collection revenues, from favorable collection pricing and (ii) $9.5 million, or 3.9% as a percentage of disposal revenues, from favorable disposal pricing associated with our landfills and transfer stations;
•
Volume decreased solid waste revenues due to (i) $(10.6) million, or (4.3)% as a percentage of disposal revenues, from lower disposal volumes, driven by lower landfill volumes and to a lesser extent transportation volumes, partially offset by higher transfer station volumes, (ii) $(6.5) million, or (0.9)% as a percentage of collection revenues from lower collection volumes, and (iii) $(0.1) million, or (1.5)% as a percentage of processing revenues, from lower processing volumes;
•
Surcharge and other fees decreased solid waste revenues primarily due to (i) lower energy and environmental fee (“E&E Fee(s)”) revenues associated with our fuel cost recovery program related to lower diesel fuel prices and (ii) lower sustainability recycling adjustment fee (“SRA Fee(s)”) revenues due to higher recycled commodity prices as compared to the prior year periods; partially offset by higher revenues from fees related to legacy fuel and environmental cost recovery programs associated with acquired businesses. See Item 7A. “
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our E&E Fee and SRA Fee;
•
Commodity price and volume increased solid waste revenues primarily due to (i) favorable commodity and energy pricing, (ii) higher energy volumes, and (iii) to a lesser extent, higher commodity processing volumes; and
•
Acquisitions increased solid waste revenues due to the partial year impact of the acquisition of eight business in fiscal year 2024, as well as the rollover impact of seven acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2023.

These cost categories may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories presented by other companies. 
The most significant items impacting the change in our cost of operations during fiscal year 2024 are summarized below:
•
Direct costs increased in aggregate dollars primarily due to (i) acquisitions and (ii) higher third-party disposal rates reflecting cost inflation; partially offset by the impact on hauling and transportation costs related to municipal biosolid volumes in our National Accounts business.
•
Direct labor costs increased primarily due to (i) acquisitions and (ii) higher wages and benefit costs reflecting cost inflation; partially offset by improved routing efficiencies.
•
Direct operational costs increased in aggregate dollars primarily due to (i) acquisitions, (ii) higher leachate disposal costs, (iii) higher short term rental expense driven by delays in the delivery of fleet vehicles as well as needs from entering new municipal contracts, (iv) higher accretion expense associated with changes in the timing and cost estimates of our closure, post-closure, and capping obligations, (v) higher accruals related to insurance claims, and (vi) general cost inflation; partially offset by lower host community and royalty fees.
•
Fuel costs increased in aggregate dollars due to acquisitions, partially offset primarily by lower diesel fuel prices. See Item 7A. “
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk”
 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our fuel costs.
•
Maintenance and repair costs increased due to (i) acquisitions, (ii) higher personnel and parts costs reflecting cost inflation, and (iii) higher vehicle maintenance costs driven by delays in the delivery of fleet replacements.
•
Other operational costs increased due to (i) acquisitions, (ii) higher spending associated with supporting acquisition-related growth, and (iii) general cost inflation.
General and Administration
General and administration expense includes: (i) labor costs, which consist of salaries, wages, incentive compensation and related benefit costs such as health and welfare benefits and workers compensation costs related to management, clerical and administrative functions; (ii) professional service fees; (iii) provision for expected credit losses; and (iv) other overhead costs including those associated with marketing, sales and community relations efforts.

General and administration expense increased in aggregate dollars in fiscal year 2024 primarily due to (i) acquisition activity, including increased labor costs, professional fees and other costs to support our growth and acquisition strategy, (ii) increased costs related to salaries, wages, benefits and incentive compensation, (iii) legal expenses primarily associated with employee separation, (iv) higher accruals related to insurance claims, and (vi) general cost inflation.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization expense includes: (i) depreciation of property and equipment (including assets recorded for finance leases) on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets; (ii) amortization of landfill costs (including those costs incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill development and construction, along with asset retirement costs arising from closure and post-closure obligations) on a units-of-consumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the total estimated remaining capacity of a site, which includes both permitted capacity and unpermitted expansion capacity that meets certain criteria for amortization purposes, and amortization of landfill asset retirement costs arising from final capping obligations on a units-of-consumption method as airspace is consumed over the estimated capacity associated with each final capping event; and (iii) amortization of intangible assets with a definite life, based on the economic benefit provided, or using the sum of years digits or straight-line methods over the definitive terms of the related agreements.

Expense from Acquisition Activities
In fiscal years 2024 and 2023, we recognized expenses of $24.9 million and $15.0 million, respectively, comprised primarily of legal, consulting, rebranding and other costs associated with the due diligence, acquisition and integration of acquired businesses. Fiscal year 2024 included a charge for an increase in the reserve against accounts receivable of the businesses acquired in the GFL Acquisition as a result of our inability to pursue collections during the transition services period with the seller, resulting in accounts receivable aged beyond what is typical in our business.  See Note 5, 
Business Combinations,
 to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. “
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”
 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for disclosure regarding acquisition activity.
Landfill Capping (Recovery) Charge - Veneer Failure
In fiscal year 2023, we recorded a charge of $3.9 million consisting of (i) the write-off of historical payments associated with capping work that was deemed no longer viable due to a veneer failure and (ii) the related operating expenses incurred to clean up the affected capping material at a Subtitle D landfill we operate located in Seneca, New York. In fiscal year 2024, we recorded a recovery of $(1.7) million consisting of (i) a partial reversal of historical payments written off after an engineering evaluation determined that a portion of the area affected by the veneer failure was deemed to still be viable as well as (ii) a recovery of operating expenses incurred during the clean-up of the affected capping material as part of a settlement with a third party.
Southbridge Landfill Closure Charge
In June 2017, we initiated the plan to cease operations of our landfill located in Southbridge, Massachusetts (“Southbridge Landfill”) and later closed it in November 2018 when the Southbridge Landfill reached its final capacity
.
 Accordingly, in fiscal years 2024 and 2023, we recorded charges associated with the closure of our Southbridge Landfill (in millions) as follows:

Includes a non-cash charge in fiscal year 2024 associated with our receipt of a final closure permit (the “Closure Permit”) from the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection related to the Southbridge Landfill. Pursuant to the terms of the Closure Permit, we are required to meet certain general permit conditions and certain specific permit conditions (collectively, the “Conditions”), including environmental monitoring, third-party inspections, inspection of the final cover, leachate sampling, post-closure monitoring, and other post-closure requirements. We have revised the accrued post-closure liability for the Southbridge Landfill to reflect the estimated cost of satisfying the expanded Conditions as currently specified in the Closure Permit. See Note 10, 
Final Capping, Closure and Post-Closure Costs,
 to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. “
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”
 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for disclosure regarding our landfill final capping, closure and post-closure costs.
Legal Settlement
In fiscal year 2023, we recorded a charge of $6.2 million in connection with reaching an agreement at a mediation held on June 20, 2023 with the collective class members of a class action lawsuit relating to certain claims under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (“FLSA”) as well as state wage and hours laws. The settlement agreement, which received court approval, was executed on July 24, 2023 and subsequently paid in fiscal year 2024.
Other expenses
Interest Expense, net
Our interest expense, net increased $15.1 million in fiscal year 2024 due primarily to the roll over impacts of (i) entering into a $430.0 million aggregate principal amount term loan A facility to partially fund the GFL Acquisition in June 2023 and (ii) the issuance of $35.0 million aggregate principal amount of New York State Environmental Facilities Corporation Solid Waste Disposal Revenue Bonds Series 2020R-2 (“New York Bonds 2020R-2”) in August 2023.

to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. “

Debt Modification Expense
In fiscal year 2024, we recognized debt modification expense of $1.4 million associated with agent fees and other third-party costs we paid during the refinancing of our Credit Agreement (as defined below).
Loss from Termination of Bridge Financing
In fiscal year 2023, we wrote-off the unamortized debt issuance costs and recognized a loss from termination of bridge financing upon the extinguishment of both a secured bridge financing agreement in connection with the GFL Acquisition of $3.7 million, and an unsecured bridge financing agreement in connection with the Twin Bridges Acquisition of $4.5 million.
Provision  for Income Taxes
Our provision for income taxes was $7.5 million in fiscal year 2024 and $11.6 million in fiscal year 2023. For fiscal year 2024, the provision for income taxes included $0.6 million of current income taxes and $6.9 million of deferred income taxes. The provision for income taxes in fiscal year 2023 included $4.4 million of current income taxes and $7.2 million of deferred income taxes. The effective rate for the fiscal year 2024 was 35.7% and is computed based on the statutory rate of 21% adjusted primarily for state taxes and certain nondeductible expenses.
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”) was enacted. The TCJA significantly changed U.S. corporate income tax laws by, among other things, changing carryforward rules for net operating losses. Under the Internal Revenue Code, as amended by the TCJA, federal net operating loss carryforwards generated before the 2018 tax year continue to be carried forward for 20 years and are able to fully offset taxable income (“pre-2018 net operating losses”). Federal net operating losses generated following the 2017 tax year are carried forward indefinitely, but generally may only offset up to 80% of taxable income earned in a tax year (“post-2017 net operating losses”).
Depending on bonus depreciation and other elections made on the 2024 tax return when filed, we project to carry no pre-2018 net operating losses and $83.2 million of post-2017 net operating losses into the 2025 tax year.
In addition, the TCJA added limitations on the deductibility of interest expense that became more restrictive beginning in tax year 2023 and limits the deductibility of some of our interest expense.

Depending on elections made on the 2024 return when filed, we expect a combined $36.0 million of interest expense to be disallowed for tax years 2023 and 2024. Interest expense disallowed is carried forward indefinitely for deduction in later years subject to said interest limitation.
Segment Reporting
We report selected information about our reportable operating segments in a manner consistent with that used for internal management reporting. We classify our solid waste operations on a geographic basis through regional operating segments, our Eastern, Western and Mid-Atlantic regions. Revenues associated with our solid waste operations are derived mainly from solid waste collection and disposal services, including landfill, transfer station and transportation, while also providing landfill gas-to-energy and processing services in the eastern United States. Our Resource Solutions operating segment leverages our core competencies in materials processing, industrial recycling, organics and resource management service offerings to deliver a comprehensive solution for our larger commercial, municipal, institutional and industrial customers that have more diverse waste and recycling needs. Revenues associated with our Resource Solutions operations are comprised of processing services and services provided by our National Accounts business. Revenues from processing services are derived from customers in the form of processing fees, tipping fees, commodity sales, and organic material sales. Revenues from our National Accounts business are derived from brokerage services and overall resource management services providing a wide range of environmental services and resource management solutions to large and complex organizations, as well as traditional collection, disposal and recycling services provided to large account multi-site customers. Legal, tax, information technology, human resources, certain finance and accounting and other administrative functions are included in our Corporate Entities segment, which is not a reportable operating segment. Operating income by segment reported in fiscal year 2023 has been updated to conform with the presentation for fiscal year 2024, which does not have Corporate Entities costs allocated to our reportable operating segments.

Revenues increased in fiscal year 2024 as compared to the prior year, primarily driven by (i) the contribution from acquisitions, (ii) favorable collection pricing of $18.8 million, or 7.0% as a percentage of collection revenues, (iii)  higher disposal volume of $5.1 million, or 5.2% as a percentage of disposal revenues, (iv) favorable disposal pricing of $3.4 million, or 3.4% as a percentage of disposal revenues, (v) higher commodity price and volume revenues primarily associated with energy volumes, and (vi) higher collection volume of $0.2 million, or 0.1% as a percentage of collection revenues; partially offset by (a) lower surcharge and other fees revenues due to lower E&E Fee revenues associated with our fuel cost recovery program related to lower diesel fuel prices and lower SRA Fee revenues due to higher recycled commodity prices as compared to the prior year period, and (b) lower processing volume of $(0.3) million, or (3.0)% as a percentage of processing operations.

Operating income increased in fiscal year 2024 by $6.7 million as compared to the prior year. The year-over-year increase was driven by (i) revenues growth, described above, (ii)  higher intercompany related operating income, (iii) lower costs due to improved routing efficiencies, and (d) a charge for the FLSA-related legal settlement in fiscal year 2023; partially offset by (a) the charge related to the Southbridge Landfill, (b) higher costs associated with operating and supporting acquired businesses, (c) increased depreciation expense due to acquisitions and investment in property and equipment, (d) general cost inflation, including for disposal, labor, and maintenance costs, (e) higher leachate disposal costs, (f) higher accretion and landfill amortization expense associated with changes in the timing and cost estimates of our closure, post-closure, and capping obligations, and (g) higher accruals related to insurance claims.

Operating income increased in fiscal year 2024 by $11.7 million as compared to the prior year.

The operating loss of $(18.0) million in fiscal year 2024 was impacted by (i) $50.6 million of depreciation and amortization expense, including that of acquired assets, new investment in property and equipment and accelerated amortization schedules of certain acquired intangibles, as well as (ii) $14.8 million of expense from acquisition activities, comprised primarily of integration costs, including rebranding efforts and a charge for an increase in the reserve against accounts receivable of the businesses acquired in the GFL Acquisition as a result of our inability to pursue collections during the transition services period with the seller, resulting in accounts receivable aged beyond what is typical in our business.
The operating loss of $(4.6) million in fiscal year 2023 was impacted by (i) $20.3 million of depreciation and amortization expense, including the impact of accelerated amortization schedules of certain acquired intangibles, as well as (ii) $5.3 million of expense from acquisition activities, comprised of legal, consulting and integration costs related to the GFL Acquisition.

Operating income increased in fiscal year 2024 by $12.0 million as compared to the prior year. The year-over-year increase was due to (i) revenues growth, described above, (ii) the impact on direct costs associated with hauling and transportation relating to municipal biosolid volumes in our National Accounts business, and (iii) operating improvements at our Boston, Massachusetts materials recovery facility (“MRF”) related to the equipment upgrade; partially offset by (a) higher costs associated with operating and supporting acquired businesses, including the impact of accelerated amortization schedules of certain intangibles, (b) increased depreciation expense due to acquisitions and investment in property and equipment, (c) general cost inflation, including for disposal, labor, and maintenance costs and (d) lower intercompany related operating income.
Corporate Entities 
Corporate Entities operating loss reflects costs, including legal, tax, information technology, human resources, certain finance and accounting and other administrative functions, depreciation and amortization expense and certain expense from acquisition activities, which are not allocated to our reportable operating segments. Operating loss increased in fiscal year 2024 by  $(24.6) million from the prior year due primarily to (i) higher costs associated with supporting acquired businesses and (ii) general cost inflation for salaries, wages, benefits, incentive compensation, professional services and other overhead costs including those associated with marketing, sales and community relations efforts.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
We continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows, our liquidity, and our capital requirements in order to properly manage our liquidity needs as we move forward based on the capital intensive nature of our business and our growth acquisition strategy. As of December 31, 2024, we had $675.4 million of undrawn capacity under our $700.0 million revolving credit facility (“Revolving Credit Facility”) and $383.3 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash to help meet our short-term and long-term liquidity needs. We expect existing cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash combined with available cash flows from operations and financing activities to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. 
Our known current and long-term uses of cash include, among other possible demands: (i) acquisitions, (ii) capital expenditures and leases, (iii) repayments to service debt and other long-term obligations, and (iv) payments for final capping, closure and post-closure asset retirement obligations and environmental remediation liabilities. We have made in the past, and plan to make in the future, acquisitions to expand service areas, densify existing operations, and grow services for our customers. Future acquisitions may include larger acquisitions that may be inside or outside of our existing market, which could require additional financing either in the form of debt or equity.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased $48.3 million in fiscal year 2024 as compared to fiscal year 2023. This was the result of revenue growth driven by acquisition activity, partially offset by higher interest expense and an increase in the unfavorable cash flow impact associated with the changes in our assets and liabilities, net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures.

Capital expenditures
. Capital expenditures were $48.3 million higher in fiscal year 2024 as compared to fiscal year 2023 primarily due to higher capital spend driven by (i) acquisition activity, (ii) spend related to the retrofitting of our Willimantic, Connecticut MRF, (iii) landfill development, (iv) increased investment in our fleet, and (v) general inflation in capital costs.

A summary of the most significant items affecting the change in our financing cash flows follows:
Debt activity
. Net cash associated with debt activity decreased $(375.7) million in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023. In September 2024, we entered into the second amended and restated credit agreement (“Credit Agreement”), which amended and restated in its entirety our amended and restated credit agreement (“Existing Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement provides for a $800.0 million aggregate principal amount term loan A facility (“Term Loan Facility”) and a $700.0 million Revolving Credit Facility, with a $155.0 million sublimit for letters of credit (collectively, the “Credit Facility”). The proceeds of the Credit Facility refinanced the $769.3 million at December 31, 2023, aggregate principal amount term loan A facilities under the Existing Credit Agreement, including the $430.0 million at December 31, 2023, aggregate principal amount 2023 term loan A facility we entered into in June 2023. In addition to the activity related to our Credit Agreement and Existing Credit Agreement, we completed the issuance of $45.0 million aggregate principal amount of Finance Authority of Maine Solid Waste Disposal Revenue Bonds Series 2024 in December 2024 and in August 2023 we completed the issuance of $35.0 million aggregate principal amount of New York Bonds 2020R-2.
Payments of debt issuance costs. 
We paid $6.6 million of debt issuance costs in fiscal year 2024 primarily related to refinancing activities associated with entering into the Credit Agreement as compared to $12.8 million of debt issuance costs in fiscal year 2023 related primarily to bridge financing activities associated with the GFL Acquisition and the Twin Bridges Acquisition.
Payment of debt modification costs
. We paid $1.4 million of agent fees and other third-party costs in fiscal year 2024 associated with the refinancing of our Credit Agreement.
Proceeds from the public offering of Class A Common Stock.
 In September 2024, we completed a public offering of 5.2 million shares of our Class A common stock at a public offering price of $100.00 per share. After deducting stock issuance costs, including underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses, the offering resulted in net proceeds of $496.2 million. The net proceeds from this offering were used to repay borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and are further available to fund acquisition activity

and for general corporate purposes.
On June 16, 2023, we completed a public offering of 6.1 million shares of our Class A common stock at a public offering price of $85.50 per share. After deducting stock issuance costs, including underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses, the offering resulted in net proceeds of $496.2 million. The net proceeds from this offering were and are to be used to fund acquisition activity, including the GFL Acquisition and the Twin Bridges Acquisition, to pay certain costs associated with acquisition activities, and to repay borrowings and/or debt securities.

Outstanding Long-Term Debt
Credit Facility
As of December 31, 2024, we are party to the Credit Agreement, which provides for a $800.0 million aggregate principal amount Term Loan Facility and a $700.0 million Revolving Credit Facility, with a $155.0 million sublimit for letters of credit. We have the right to request, at our discretion, an increase in the amount of loans under the Credit Facility by an aggregate amount of $200.0 million, subject to further increase based on the terms and conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Facility has a 5-year term that matures in September 2029. The Credit Facility shall bear interest, at our election, at term secured overnight financing rate (“Term SOFR”) or at a base rate, in each case plus or minus any sustainable rate adjustment of up to positive or negative 4.0 basis points per annum, plus an applicable interest rate margin based upon our consolidated net leverage ratio as follows:
Term SOFR Loans
Base Rate Loans
Credit Facility
1.300% to 2.175%
0.300% to 1.175%
A commitment fee will be charged on undrawn amounts of our Revolving Credit Facility based upon our consolidated net leverage ratio in the range of 0.20% to 0.40% per annum, plus a sustainability adjustment of up to positive or negative 1.0 basis point per annum. The Credit Agreement provides that Term SOFR is subject to a zero percent floor. We are also required to pay a fronting fee for each letter of credit of 0.25% per annum. Interest under the Credit Agreement is subject to increase by 2.00% per annum during the continuance of a payment default and may be subject to increase by 2.00% per annum during the continuance of any other event of default. The Credit Facility is guaranteed jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally by all of our significant wholly-owned subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of our assets. As of December 31, 2024, further advances were available under the Credit Facility in the amount of $675.4 million. The available amount is net of outstanding irrevocable letters of credit totaling $24.6 million, and as of December 31, 2024 no amount had been drawn. 
The Credit Agreement requires us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated net leverage ratio, to be measured at the end of each fiscal quarter. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial covenants contained in the Credit Agreement as follows (in millions):

The maximum consolidated net leverage ratio is calculated as consolidated funded debt, net of up to $100.0 million of unencumbered cash and cash equivalents (calculated at $1,048.2 million as of December 31, 2024, or $1,148.2 million of consolidated funded debt less $100.0 million total of unencumbered cash and cash equivalents), divided by consolidated EBITDA. Consolidated EBITDA is based on operating results for the twelve months preceding the measurement date of December 31, 2024. Consolidated funded debt, net and consolidated EBITDA as defined by the Credit Agreement (“Consolidated EBITDA”) are non-GAAP financial measures that should not be considered an alternative to any measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). A reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to Consolidated EBITDA is as follows (in millions):

In addition to the financial covenants, the Credit Agreement contains a number of important customary affirmative and negative covenants which restrict, among other things, our ability to sell assets, incur additional debt, create liens, make investments, and pay dividends. We do not believe that these restrictions impact our ability to meet future liquidity needs. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the Credit Agreement. 
An event of default under any of our debt agreements could permit some of our lenders, including the lenders under the Credit Facility, to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be immediately due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, or, in the case of the Credit Facility, terminate the commitment to make further credit extensions thereunder, which could, in turn, trigger cross-defaults under other debt obligations. If we were unable to repay debt to our lenders or were otherwise in default under any provision governing our outstanding debt obligations, our secured lenders could proceed against us and against the collateral securing that debt.
Based on the seasonality of our business, operating results in the late fall, winter and early spring months are generally lower than the remainder of our fiscal year. Given the cash flow impact that this seasonality, the capital intensive nature of our business and the timing of debt payments has on our business, we typically incur higher debt borrowings in order to meet our liquidity needs during these times. Consequently, our availability and performance against our financial covenants may tighten during these times as well. 
Tax-Exempt Financings and Other Debt
As of December 31, 2024, we had outstanding $277.0 million aggregate principal amount of tax-exempt bonds, $69.7 million aggregate principal amount of finance leases and $1.5 million aggregate principal amount of notes payable. See Note 11,

Inflation
Inflationary increases in costs, including current inflationary pressures associated primarily with labor, certain other cost categories, and capital items, have materially affected, and may continue to materially affect, our operating margins and cash flows. However, we believe that our flexible pricing structures and cost recovery fees are allowing us to recover and will continue to allow us to recover certain inflationary costs from our customer base. Consistent with industry practice, most of our contracts and service agreements provide for a pass-through of certain costs to our customers, including increases in landfill tipping fees and in most cases fuel costs, intended to mitigate the impact of inflation on our operating results. We have also implemented a number of operating efficiency programs that seek to improve productivity and reduce our service costs, and our fuel cost recovery programs, primarily the energy component of our E&E Fee, which is designed to recover escalating fuel price fluctuations above a periodically reset floor. Despite these programs, competitive factors may require us to absorb at least a portion of these cost increases. See Item 7A. “
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk”
 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our fuel cost recovery programs. Additionally, management’s estimates associated with inflation have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental remediation liabilities.
Regional Economic Conditions
Our business is primarily located in the eastern United States. Therefore, our business, financial condition and operational results are susceptible to downturns in the general economy in this geographic region and other factors affecting the region, such as state and local regulations, labor availability and severe weather conditions. We are unable to forecast or determine the timing and/or the future impact of a sustained economic slowdown or other factors affecting the region.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions
Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments which are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of their evaluation form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. However, even under optimal circumstances, estimates routinely require adjustments based on changing assumptions and circumstances, or new or better information becoming available. Accordingly, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and circumstances. 
The following is a list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows and that may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. Our significant accounting policies are more fully discussed in Note 3, 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. “

Landfill Accounting
Landfill Development Costs. 
We estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity (see landfill development costs discussed within the “
Property and Equipment
” accounting policy more fully discussed in Note 3, 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. “
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”
 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). The projection of these landfill costs is dependent, in part, on future events. The remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized, net of accumulated airspace amortization, and projections of future purchase and development costs including capitalized interest. The interest capitalization rate is based on our weighted average interest rate incurred on borrowings outstanding during the period.
Under life-cycle accounting, all costs related to acquisition and construction of landfill sites are capitalized and charged to expense based on tonnage placed into each site. Landfill permitting, acquisition and preparation costs are amortized on the units-of-consumption method as landfill airspace is consumed. In determining the amortization rate for each of our landfills, preparation costs include the total estimated costs to complete construction of the landfills’ permitted and expansion capacity. The average amortization rate per ton for our landfills during fiscal years 2024 and 2023 was $7.52 and $7.23, respectively.

Table of Contents
Final Capping, Closure and Post-Closure Costs. 
The cost estimates for final capping, closure and post-closure activities at landfills for which we have responsibility are estimated based on our interpretations of current requirements and proposed or anticipated regulatory changes. Our investment in final capping, closure and post-closure activities is focused on meeting these regulations, therefore, reducing emissions of air pollutants from our landfills. 
We also estimate additional costs based on the amount a third party would charge us to perform such activities even when we expect to perform these activities internally. We estimate the airspace to be consumed related to each final capping event and the timing of construction related to each final capping event and of closure and post-closure activities. Because landfill final capping, closure and post-closure obligations are measured at estimated fair value using present value techniques, changes in the estimated timing of construction of future landfill final capping and closure and post-closure activities would have an effect on these liabilities, related assets and results of operations.
Final capping activities include the installation of liners, drainage, compacted soil layers and topsoil over areas of a landfill where total airspace has been consumed and waste is no longer being received. Final capping activities occur throughout the life of the landfill. Our engineering personnel estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the acreage to be capped, along with the final capping materials and activities required. The estimates also consider when these costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. The engineers then quantify the landfill capacity associated with each final capping event and the costs for each event are amortized over that capacity as waste is received at the landfill.
Closure and post-closure costs represent future estimated costs related to monitoring and maintenance of a solid waste landfill after a landfill facility ceases to accept waste and closes. We estimate, based on input from our engineers, accountants, lawyers, managers and others, our future cost requirements for closure and post-closure monitoring and maintenance based on our interpretation of the technical standards of the Subtitle D regulations and the air emissions standards under the Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended, as they are being applied on a state-by-state basis. Closure and post-closure accruals for the cost of monitoring and maintenance include site inspection, groundwater monitoring, leachate management, methane gas control and recovery, and operation and maintenance costs to be incurred for a period which is generally for a term of 30 years after final closure of a landfill. In determining estimated future closure and post-closure costs, we consider costs associated with permitted and permittable airspace. See Note 10, 
Final Capping, Closure and Post-Closure Costs
 to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. “
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”
 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further disclosure about final capping, closure and post-closure asset retirement costs, including revisions in estimates.
Remaining Permitted Airspace. 
Our engineers, in consultation with third-party engineering consultants and surveyors, are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills. The remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey, which is then used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography.
Expansion Airspace. 
We currently include unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances. To be considered expansion airspace all of the following criteria must be met:

•
we control the land on which the expansion is sought;
•
all technical siting criteria have been met or a variance has been obtained or is reasonably expected to be obtained;
•
we have not identified any legal or political impediments which we believe will not be resolved in our favor;
•
we are actively working on obtaining any necessary permits and we expect that all required permits will be received; and
•
senior management has approved the project based on a review of the engineering design and determination that the financial return profile meets our investment criteria.
For unpermitted airspace to be included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, the expansion effort must meet all of the criteria listed above. These criteria are evaluated annually by our engineers, accountants, lawyers, managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits. Once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined in cubic yards, an airspace utilization factor (“AUF”) is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons. The AUF is established using a process that considers the measured density obtained from annual surveys. When we include the expansion airspace in our calculation of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, we include the projected costs for development, as well as the projected asset retirement costs related to final capping, closure and post-closure of the expansion airspace in the amortization basis of the landfill. See Part I. Item 1. “
Business
” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more disclosure about permitted and permittable capacity at our landfills.
After determining the costs and the remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills, we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and deposited at each of our landfills by dividing the costs by the corresponding number of tons. We calculate per ton amortization rates for assets associated with each final capping event, for assets related to closure and post-closure activities, and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future for each landfill. These rates per ton are updated annually, or more frequently, as significant facts change.
51
Table of Contents
It is possible that actual results, including the amount of costs incurred, the timing of final capping, closure and post-closure activities, our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions. To the extent that such estimates or related assumptions prove to be significantly different than actual results, lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates, higher final capping, closure or post-closure rates, or higher expenses. Higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs. Most significantly, if it is determined that the expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of the landfill asset, we may be required to recognize an asset impairment. If it is determined that the likelihood of receiving an expansion permit has become remote, the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately.
Accounts Receivable, Net of Allowance for Credit Losses
Accounts receivable represent receivables from customers for collection, transfer, recycling, disposal and other services. Our accounts receivable are recorded when billed or when related revenue is earned, if earlier, and represent claims against third parties that will be settled in cash. The carrying value of our accounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses represents its estimated net realizable value. Estimates are used in determining our allowance for credit losses based on, among other things, our historical loss trends, the age of outstanding accounts receivable, and current and expected economic conditions. Additions charged to expense in fiscal year 2024 consider the current economic conditions and the potential impact to our customers’ ability to pay for services that we have provided. Our reserve is evaluated and revised on a quarterly basis. Past due accounts receivable are written off when deemed to be uncollectible. See Note 6, 
Accounts Receivable, Net of Allowance for Credit Losses 
to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. “
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”
 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further disclosure about changes to the allowance for credit losses.
Goodwill and Other Intangibles
In testing for goodwill impairment, we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit, which we have determined to be our geographic operating segments and our Resource Solutions operating segment and compare the fair value with the carrying value of the net assets of each reporting unit. If the fair value is less than its carrying value, then we would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, noting that the amount is not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. 
To determine the fair value of each of our reporting units as a whole, we use discounted cash flow analyses, which require significant assumptions and estimates about the future operations of each reporting unit. Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the determination of appropriate discount rates, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and growth rates. The cash flows employed in our discounted cash flow analyses are based on financial forecasts developed internally by management. Our discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of our risk adjusted discount rate, applicable for each reporting unit. In assessing the reasonableness of our determined fair values of our reporting units, we evaluate our results against our current market capitalization.
We elected to perform a quantitative analysis as part of our annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal year 2024. As of October 1, 2024, our Eastern, Western, Mid-Atlantic and Resource Solutions reporting units indicated that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount, including goodwill. The fair value of our Eastern, Western, Mid-Atlantic and Resource Solutions reporting units exceeded its carrying value by in excess of 23%. We incurred no impairment of goodwill as a result of our annual goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years 2024 or 2023. However, there can be no assurance that goodwill will not be impaired at any time in the future. 
Intangible assets consist primarily of covenants not-to-compete, customer relationships and trade names. Intangible assets are recorded at fair value and are amortized based on the economic benefit provided or using the sum of years digits or straight-line methods over their estimated useful lives. Covenants not-to-compete, customer relationships, and trade names are typically amortized over a term of no more than 10 years. See Note 5, 
Business Combinations

Recovery of Long-Lived Assets
We continually assess whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that may warrant revision of the estimated useful lives of our long-lived assets (other than goodwill) or whether the remaining balances of those assets should be evaluated for possible impairment. Long-lived assets include, for example, capitalized landfill costs, property and equipment, identifiable intangible assets, and operating lease right-of-use assets. Events or changes in circumstances that may indicate that an asset may be impaired include the following:

•
a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or asset group;
52
Table of Contents
•
a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition;
•
a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset or asset group, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator;
•
an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long-lived asset;
•
a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset or asset group;
•
a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life; or
•
an impairment of goodwill at a reporting unit.
There are certain indicators listed above that require significant judgment and understanding of the waste industry when applied to landfill development or expansion. For example, a regulator may initially deny a landfill expansion permit application although the expansion permit is ultimately granted. In addition, management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace. Therefore, certain events could occur in the ordinary course of business and not necessarily be considered indicators of impairment due to the unique nature of the waste industry.
If an impairment indicator occurs, we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows. We group our long-lived assets for this purpose at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are primarily independent of the cash flows of other assets or asset groups. If the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows, we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value.
To determine fair value, we use discounted cash flow analyses and estimates about the future cash flows of the asset or asset group. This analysis includes a determination of an appropriate discount rate, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and growth rates. The cash flows employed in our discounted cash flow analyses are typically based on financial forecasts developed internally by management. The discount rate used is commensurate with the risks involved. We may also rely on third-party valuations and or information available regarding the market value for similar assets.
If the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment occurs. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized. We incurred no impairment of long-lived assets in fiscal years 2024 or 2023. However, there can be no assurance that long-lived assets will not be impaired at any time in the future. 
Business Combinations
We acquire businesses in the waste industry, including non-hazardous waste collection, transfer station, recycling and disposal operations, as part of our growth strategy. Businesses are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.
We recognize, separately from goodwill, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated acquisition-date fair values. We measure and recognize goodwill as of the acquisition date as the excess of: (a) the aggregate of the fair value of consideration transferred, the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree (if any) and the acquisition date fair value of our previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any), over (b) the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If information about facts and circumstances existing as of the acquisition date is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which a business combination occurs, we will report provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. The measurement period ends once we receive the information we were seeking; however, this period will not extend beyond one year from the acquisition date. Any material adjustments recognized during the measurement period will be recognized in the consolidated financial statements in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. All acquisition-related transaction and restructuring costs are to be expensed as incurred. See Note 5,

Self-Insurance Liabilities and Related Costs
We are self-insured for vehicles and workers’ compensation with reinsurance coverage limiting our maximum exposure. In fiscal year 2024, our maximum exposure per individual event under the workers’ compensation plan was $1.5 million. In fiscal year 2024, our minimum and maximum exposure per individual event under the automobile plan were up to $2.0 million and $4.2 million, respectively. The liability for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, is determined by management with the assistance of a third-party actuary and reflected in our consolidated balance sheets as an accrued liability. We use a third party to track and evaluate actual claims experience for consistency with the data used in the annual actuarial valuation. The actuarial-determined liability is calculated based on historical data, which considers both the frequency and settlement amount of claims. Our self-insurance reserves totaled $24.9 million and $22.4 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly different than our ultimate obligations if variables such as the frequency or severity of future events differ significantly from our assumptions.
Income Taxes
We use estimates to determine our provision for income taxes and related assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances have been established for the possibility that tax benefits may not be realized for certain deferred tax assets. Deferred income taxes are recognized based on the expected future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, calculated using currently enacted tax rates. We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making this determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. In the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes.
We account for income tax uncertainties according to guidance on the recognition, derecognition and measurement of potential tax benefits associated with tax positions. We recognize interest and penalties relating to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense.

Contingent Liabilities
We are subject to various legal proceedings, claims and regulatory matters, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. We determine whether to disclose or accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote, reasonably possible or probable, and whether it can be reasonably estimated. We analyze our litigation and regulatory matters based on available information to assess the potential liabilities. Management’s assessment is developed based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies. We accrue for loss contingencies when such amounts are probable and reasonably estimable. If a contingent liability is only reasonably possible, we will disclose the potential range of the loss, if estimable. We record losses related to contingencies in cost of operations or general and administration expenses, depending on the nature of the underlying transaction leading to the loss contingency.

Stock-Based Compensation
Our equity awards granted generally consist of stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and market-based performance stock units. The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of restricted stock award and restricted stock unit grants is at a price equal to the fair market value of our Class A common stock at the date of grant. Compensation expense associated with our stock options, restricted stock awards and restricted stock units is recognized as expense in general and administration expense over the employee’s requisite service period. The fair value of market-based performance stock unit grants is valued using a Monte Carlo pricing model and compensation expense is recognized as expense in general and administration expense ratably over the performance period based on our estimated achievement of the established performance criteria. For purposes of calculating stock-based compensation expense, forfeitures are accounted for as they occur. See Note 13,

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
In the normal course of business we are exposed to market risks, including changes in diesel fuel prices, interest rates and certain commodity prices. We have a variety of strategies to mitigate these market risks, including those discussed below.
Fuel Price Risk
The price and supply of fuel are unpredictable and fluctuate based on events beyond our control, including among others, geopolitical developments, supply and demand for oil and gas, actions by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil and gas producers, war and unrest in oil producing countries and regional production patterns. Fuel is needed to run our fleet of trucks, equipment and other aspects of our operations, and price escalations for fuel increase our operating expenses. We have fuel cost recovery programs, primarily the energy component of our E&E Fee which is designed to offset some or all of the impact of diesel fuel price increases above a periodically reset floor and contemplates a minimum customer participation level to cover changes in our fuel costs. The energy component of the E&E Fee floats on a monthly basis based upon changes in a published diesel fuel price index and is tied to a price escalation index with a look-back provision, which results in a timing lag in our ability to match the changes in the fuel cost component of the fee to diesel fuel price fluctuations during periods of rapid price changes. In certain circumstances, a substantial rise or drop in fuel costs could materially affect our revenue and costs of operations. However, a substantial rise or drop in fuel costs should not have a material impact on our results of operations. In addition, we are susceptible to increases in fuel surcharges from our vendors. 
Based on our consumption levels in the last twelve months ended December 31, 2024, combined with our expected fuel consumption related to recently closed acquisitions, and after considering physically settled fuel contracts, we believe a $0.40 cent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel would change our direct fuel costs by approximately $6.2 million per year. Offsetting these changes in direct fuel expense would be changes in the energy component of the E&E Fees charged to our customers. Based on participation rates as of December 31, 2024 and considering recently closed acquisitions, we believe a $0.40 cent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel would change the energy component of the E&E Fee by approximately $5.5 million per year. In addition to direct fuel costs related to our consumption levels, we are also subject to fuel surcharge expense from third-party transportation providers. Other operational costs and capital expenditures may also be impacted by fuel prices.
Our fuel costs were $56.8 million in fiscal year 2024, or 3.6% of revenue, compared to $48.6 million in fiscal year 2023, or 3.8% of revenue.
Commodity Price Risk
We market a variety of materials, including fibers such as old corrugated cardboard and old newsprint, plastics, glass, ferrous and aluminum metals. We may use a number of strategies to mitigate impacts from these recycled material commodity price fluctuations including: (1) charging collection customers a floating SRA fee to reduce recycling commodity risks; (2) providing in-bound MRF customers with a revenue share or indexed materials purchases in higher commodity price markets, or charging these same customers a processing cost or tipping fee per ton in lower commodity price markets; (3) selling recycled commodities to out-bound MRF customers through floor price or fixed price agreements; or (4) entering into fixed price contracts or hedges that mitigate the variability in cash flows generated from the sales of recycled paper at floating prices. Although we have introduced these risk mitigation programs to help offset volatility in commodity prices and to offset higher labor or capital costs to meet more stringent contamination standards, we cannot provide assurance that we can use these programs with our customers in all circumstances or that they will mitigate these risks in an evolving recycling environment. We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives. As of December 31, 2024, we were not party to any commodity hedging agreements.
Should recycled material commodity prices change by $10 per ton, we estimate that our annual operating income margin would change by approximately $0.5 million annually. Our sensitivity to changes in commodity prices is complex because each customer contract is unique relative to revenue sharing, tipping or processing fees and other arrangements. The above operating income impact may not be indicative of future operating results and actual results may vary materially.

Interest Rate Risk 
Our strategy to reduce exposure to interest rate risk involves entering into interest rate derivative agreements to hedge against adverse movements in interest rates related to the variable rate portion of our long-term debt. We have designated these derivative instruments as highly effective cash flow hedges, and therefore the change in fair value is recorded in our stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and included in interest expense at the same time as interest expense is affected by the hedged transactions. Differences paid or received over the life of the agreements are recorded as additions to or reductions of interest expense on the underlying debt and included in cash flows from operating activities.
A summary of the changes to the notional amount of interest rate derivative agreements follows (in millions):

These agreements mature between February 2026 and June 2028 and state that we receive interest based on Term SOFR, restricted by a 0.0% floor, and pay interest at a weighted average rate of approximately 3.60%.
As of December 31, 2024, we have $348.2 million of fixed rate debt in addition to the $515.0 million fixed through our interest rate derivative agreements. We had interest rate risk relating to approximately $285.0 million of long-term debt as of December 31, 2024. The interest rate on the variable rate portion of long-term debt was approximately 6.0% at December 31, 2024. Should the average interest rate on the variable rate portion of long-term debt change by 100 basis points, we estimate that our annual interest expense would change by up to approximately $2.9 million.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Casella Waste Systems, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Casella Waste Systems, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013, and our report dated February 18, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Landfill Accounting 
As described in Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company capitalizes landfill acquisition and development costs and charges those costs to expense on a units-of-consumption method as landfill airspace is consumed. In addition, the Company accrues an asset retirement obligation for estimated capping, closure and post-closure costs related to its landfills. As described in Note 7 of the consolidated financial statements, as of December 31, 2024, the Company’s landfill assets totaled $859.6 million, and the associated amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $44.5 million. As described in Note 10 of the consolidated financial statements, as of December 31, 2024, the Company estimated its accrued capping, closure and post-closure costs at $172.2 million. The landfill asset amortization and accrued capping, closure and post-closure costs are based on estimates of future cash flows, which require significant assumptions and estimates about the future operations and retirement of each landfill. Management estimates the costs and timing of expected future cash flows based on various assumptions at each individual landfill including:
•
The future landfill development costs, as well as costs associated with the final capping, closure and post closure activities.
•
Remaining permitted and unpermitted expansion airspace, which is estimated by Company engineers, in consultation with third-party engineers and surveyors, who utilize annual aerial surveys. 
58
Table of Contents
•
Compaction factors, or airspace utilization factors, which are estimated using a process that considers the measured density obtained from annual aerial surveys.  
•
Inflation rates and the credit adjusted risk-free rate. 
We identified the Company’s landfill asset amortization expense and accrued capping, closure and post-closure costs as a critical audit matter because of the significant assumptions and judgments made by management. Auditing management’s assumptions and judgements involved a high degree of auditor judgment and increased audit effort due to the impact these assumptions have on the amounts recorded by the Company. 
Our audit procedures related to landfill asset amortization expense and accrued capping, closure and post-closure costs included the following, among others:  
•
We obtained an understanding of the relevant controls related to landfill asset amortization expense and accrued capping, closure and post-closure costs and tested such controls for design and operating effectiveness, including those over the determination of the appropriate credit adjusted risk-free and inflation rates, compaction factors, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, and permitted and unpermitted airspace.
•
We tested internal and external data used by management in the future cost estimates for both the calculation of landfill asset amortization expense rates and capping, closure and post-closure activities, by evaluating the reasons for significant changes in assumptions from historical trends and determined whether the change from the historical trend was appropriate and identified in the proper period. 
•
We confirmed the landfill topography drawings and results of aerial surveys directly with the third-party engineers. We agreed relevant data outputs from the topography drawings, such as permitted and unpermitted expansion airspace, to the relevant data inputs in management’s estimates of future cash flows. 
•
We compared remaining permitted airspace to issued permits and evaluated management’s determination of unpermitted expansion airspace through a comparison of airspace and annual aerial surveys. 
•
We compared the results of the compaction factors calculated by aerial surveys to the factors utilized by management in the estimates of future cash flows. 
•
We assessed the appropriateness of the methodology used by management in developing the inflation rate, and we tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data utilized by management.
•
We evaluated the appropriateness of the methodology used by management in developing the credit adjusted risk-free rate and tested it by comparing the Company’s credit adjusted risk-free rate to an independent data source. 
•
We assessed the qualifications, reputation, and objectivity of management’s third-party engineering specialists. 
Valuation of Certain Property and Equipment and Intangible Assets in Certain Business Combinations 
As described in Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed the acquisition of eight businesses during the year ended December 31, 2024, for total consideration of $467.9 million, net of cash acquired. The Company accounted for these transactions under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated, on a preliminary basis, to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed primarily based on their respective fair values, including identified property  and equipment of $106.9 million and identifiable intangible assets of $128.2 million. Of the identified property and equipment and identifiable intangible assets acquired, the most significant included machinery and equipment of $90.0 million and customer relationship intangible assets of $104.8 million. The Company estimated the fair value of these assets using a combination of cost, market, and income approaches, which required management to make significant estimates and assumptions.
We identified the valuation of machinery and equipment and customer relationships assets in certain business combinations completed by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2024 as a critical audit matter because of the significant estimates and assumptions management used in the fair value determination. Auditing management’s selection of the cost and market assumptions related to the valuation of the machinery and equipment assets and the forecasts of future revenue and expenses and the selection of the attrition and discount rates related to the valuation of the customer relationships required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased audit effort, including the use of our valuation specialists, due to the impact these assumptions have on the estimates of fair value.
Our audit procedures related to the valuation of machinery and equipment and customer relationships assets acquired in certain business combinations, included the following, among others:
•
We obtained an understanding of the relevant controls related to the valuation of these assets and tested such controls for design and operating effectiveness. This included management’s controls over the selection of the cost and market assumptions for the valuation of the machinery and equipment assets and the forecasts of future revenue and expenses and the selection of the attrition rates and discount rates related to the valuation of the customer relationships intangible assets. 
59
Table of Contents
•
We read the purchase and sale agreements to understand and evaluate the terms of the acquisitions.
•
We evaluated the reasonableness of the forecasts of future revenue and expenses and the selection of attrition rates used in the valuation of the customer relationships by comparing the projections and rates to historical results.
•
We tested the underlying data used by management to estimate the fair value of the machinery and equipment assets and customer relationships intangible assets for accuracy and completeness. 
•
We utilized our valuation specialists to assist in the following procedures, among others:
◦
Evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation models and methods used by management and testing their mathematical accuracy.
◦
Corroborating the market data used by management to estimate the fair value of the machinery and equipment by independently obtaining cost and market data from market sources and comparing it to the data used by management.  
◦
Comparing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rates to publicly available market data and testing the accuracy of the calculations.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Casella Waste Systems, Inc.
Opinion on the Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Casella Waste Systems, Inc.'s (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated February 18, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
As discussed in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024: LMR Disposal LLC, Roxburg Station LLC and AMP Holdings LLC (collectively, LMR); Whitetail Disposal, Inc. (Whitetail); Royal Carting Holdings Corp., Welsh Sanitation Holdings Corp., Panichi Holding Corp., Valley 82 Holding Corp., Kejem Properties, LLC, Hopewell Industrial Properties LLC, Milbrook Properties LLC, and Watch Hill Holding Corp. (collectively, Royal); and Tiger Waste Disposal Services, Inc. and Gra-Jen Properties, LLC (collectively, Tiger), because they were acquired by the Company during 2024 and have not yet been fully incorporated into the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting. We have also excluded LMR, Whitetail, Royal, and Tiger from our report of internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. Collectively, LMR, Whitetail, Royal, and Tiger represent total assets and revenues of approximately 16% and 5%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Management’s Estimates and Assumptions
Preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the accounting for and recognition and disclosure of assets, liabilities, equity, revenues and expenses. We must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision given the available data or simply cannot be readily calculated. In some cases, these estimates are difficult to determine, and we must exercise significant judgment. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, the estimates and assumptions that we consider to be significant and that present the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills, asset impairments, if applicable, goodwill recoverability assessment, accounts receivable allowance for credit losses, self-insurance reserves, deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions, estimates of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in any acquisition, contingent liabilities and stock-based compensation. Each of these items is discussed in more detail elsewhere in these notes to the consolidated financial statements. Actual results may differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, restricted investment securities, accounts receivable and derivative instruments. We maintain cash and cash equivalents and restricted investment securities with banks that at times exceed applicable insurance limits. We reduce our exposure to credit risk by maintaining such deposits with high quality financial institutions. Our concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited because of the large number and diversity of customers we serve, thus reducing the credit risk associated with any one customer group. As of December 31, 2024, no single customer or customer group represented greater than 5% of total accounts receivable. We manage credit risk through credit evaluations, credit limits, and monitoring procedures, but generally do not require collateral to support accounts receivable. We reduce our exposure to credit risk associated with derivative instruments by entering into agreements with high quality financial institutions and by evaluating and regularly monitoring their creditworthiness.
Accounts Receivable, Net of Allowance for Credit Losses
Accounts receivable represent receivables from customers for collection, transfer, recycling, disposal and other services. Our accounts receivable are recorded when billed or when related revenue is earned, if earlier, and represent claims against third parties that will be settled in cash. The carrying value of our accounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses represents its estimated net realizable value. Estimates are used in determining our allowance for credit losses based on, among other things, our historical loss trends, the age of outstanding accounts receivable, and current and expected economic conditions. Our reserve is evaluated and revised on a quarterly basis. Past due accounts receivable are written off when deemed to be uncollectible.
 See Note 6, 
Accounts Receivable, Net of Allowance for Credit Losses
 for disclosure over allowance for credit losses.
Inventory
Inventory includes secondary fibers, recyclables ready for sale, and parts and supplies. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market.

Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. 
We provide for depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method by charges to operations in amounts that allocate the cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives as follows:

The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to operations as incurred.
Landfill development costs are included in property and equipment. Landfill development costs include costs to develop each of our landfill sites, including such costs related to landfill liner material and installation, excavation for airspace, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering, capitalized interest, on-site road construction, and other capital infrastructure. Additionally, landfill development costs include all land purchases within the landfill footprint and the purchase of any required landfill buffer property. Under life-cycle accounting, these costs are capitalized and charged to expense based on tonnage placed into each site.
 See the “
Landfill Accounting
” accounting policy below for additional disclosure about the amortization of landfill development costs and Note 7, 
Property and Equipment
 for disclosure about property and equipment.
Landfill Accounting
Life Cycle Accounting
Under life-cycle accounting, all costs related to acquisition and construction of landfill sites are capitalized and charged to expense based on tonnage placed into each site. Landfill permitting, acquisition and preparation costs are amortized on the units-of-consumption method as landfill airspace is consumed. In determining the amortization rate for each of our landfills, preparation costs include the total estimated costs to complete construction of the landfills’ permitted and expansion capacity.
Landfill Development Costs
We estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity (see landfill development costs discussed within the “
Property and Equipment
” accounting policy above). The projection of these landfill costs is dependent, in part, on future events. The remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized, net of accumulated airspace amortization, and projections of future purchase and development costs including capitalized interest. The interest capitalization rate is based on our weighted average interest rate incurred on borrowings outstanding during the period. Interest capitalized during the fiscal year 2024, the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (“fiscal year 2023”) and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 (“fiscal year 2022”) was $
1,085
, $
643
 and $
330
, respectively.
Landfill Airspace
We apply the following guidelines in determining a landfill’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace:
Remaining Permitted Airspace.
 Our engineers, in consultation with third-party engineering consultants and surveyors, are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills. The remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey, which is then used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography.
Expansion Airspace
. We currently include unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances. To be considered expansion airspace all of the following criteria must be met:

•
we control the land on which the expansion is sought;
•
all technical siting criteria have been met or a variance has been obtained or is reasonably expected to be obtained;
•
we have not identified any legal or political impediments which we believe will not be resolved in our favor;
•
we are actively working on obtaining any necessary permits and we expect that all required permits will be received; and
•
senior management has approved the project based on a review of the engineering design and determination that the financial return profile meets our investment criteria.
71
Table of Contents
For unpermitted airspace to be included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, the expansion effort must meet all of the criteria listed above. These criteria are evaluated annually by our engineers, accountants, lawyers, managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits. Once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined in cubic yards, an airspace utilization factor (“AUF”) is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons. The AUF is established using a process that considers the measured density obtained from annual surveys. When we include the expansion airspace in our calculation of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, we include the projected costs for development, as well as the projected asset retirement costs related to final capping, closure and post-closure of the expansion airspace in the amortization basis of the landfill.
After determining the costs and the remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills, we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and deposited at each of our landfills by dividing the costs by the corresponding number of tons. We calculate per ton amortization rates for assets associated with each final capping event, for assets related to closure and post-closure activities, and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future for each landfill. These rates per ton are updated annually, or more frequently, as significant facts change.
It is possible that actual results, including the amount of costs incurred, the timing of final capping, closure and post-closure activities, our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts, could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions. To the extent that such estimates or related assumptions prove to be significantly different than actual results, lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates, higher final capping, closure or post-closure rates, or higher expenses. Higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs. Most significantly, if it is determined that the expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of the landfill asset, we may be required to recognize an asset impairment. If it is determined that the likelihood of receiving an expansion permit has become remote, the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately. 
Final Capping, Closure and Post-Closure Costs
The following is a description of our landfill asset retirement activities and related accounting:
Final Capping Costs.
 Final capping activities include the installation of liners, drainage, compacted soil layers and topsoil over areas of a landfill where total airspace has been consumed and waste is no longer being received. Final capping activities occur throughout the life of the landfill. Our engineering personnel estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the acreage to be capped, along with the final capping materials and activities required. The estimates also consider when these costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. The engineers then quantify the landfill capacity associated with each final capping event and the costs for each event are amortized over that capacity as waste is received at the landfill.
Closure and Post-Closure Costs.
 Closure and post-closure costs represent future estimated costs related to monitoring and maintenance of a solid waste landfill after a landfill facility ceases to accept waste and closes. We estimate, based on input from our engineers, accountants, lawyers, managers and others, our future cost requirements for closure and post-closure monitoring and maintenance based on our interpretation of the technical standards of the Subtitle D regulations and the air emissions standards under the Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended, as they are being applied on a state-by-state basis. Closure and post-closure accruals for the cost of monitoring and maintenance include site inspection, groundwater monitoring, leachate management, methane gas control and recovery, and operation and maintenance costs to be incurred for a period which is generally for a term of 
30
 years after final closure of a landfill. In determining estimated future closure and post-closure costs, we consider costs associated with permitted and permittable airspace.
Our estimated future final capping, closure and post-closure costs, based on our interpretation of current requirements and proposed regulatory changes, are intended to approximate fair value. Absent quoted market prices, our cost estimates are based on historical experience, professional engineering judgment and quoted or actual prices paid for similar work. Our estimate of costs to discharge final capping, closure and post-closure asset retirement obligations for landfills are developed in today’s dollars. These costs are then inflated to the period of performance using an estimate of inflation, which is updated annually (
2.6
% as of December 31, 2024). Final capping, closure and post-closure liabilities are then discounted using the credit adjusted risk-free rate in effect at the time the obligation is incurred. The weighted average rate applicable to our asset retirement obligations as of December 31, 2024 is between approximately 
6.1
% and 
10.0
%, the range of the credit adjusted risk free rates effective since the adoption of guidance associated with asset retirement obligations in the fiscal year ended April 30, 2004. Accretion expense is necessary to increase the accrued final capping, closure and post-closure liabilities to the future anticipated obligation. To accomplish this, we accrete our final capping, closure and post-closure accrual balances using the same credit-adjusted risk-free rate that was used to calculate the recorded liability. Accretion expense on recorded landfill liabilities is recorded to cost of operations from the time the liability is recognized until the costs are paid. Accretion expense on recorded landfill liabilities amounted to $
11,350
, $
9,529
 and $
7,565
 in fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
72
Table of Contents
We provide for the accrual and amortization of estimated future obligations for closure and post-closure based on tonnage placed into each site. With regards to final capping, the liability is recognized, and the costs are amortized based on the remaining airspace related to the specific final capping event. See Note 10, 
Final Capping, Closure and Post-Closure Costs
 for disclosure about asset retirement obligations related to final capping, closure and post-closure costs and Note 17, 
Other Items and Charges 
for disclosure about the write-off and subsequent partial recovery of historical payments for capping work associated with a veneer failure at a Subtitle D landfill we operate located in Seneca, New York (“Ontario County Landfill”) that occurred in fiscal year 2023.
We operate in states which require a certain portion of landfill final capping, closure and post-closure obligations to be secured by financial assurance, which may take the form of surety bonds, letters of credit and restricted investment securities.
 Surety bonds securing closure and post-closure obligations at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 totaled $
266,446
 and $
241,728
, respectively. There are 
no
 letters of credit securing closure and post-closure obligations as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. See Note 14, 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
for disclosure about restricted investment securities securing closure and post-closure obligations.
Lease Accounting
We lease vehicles, equipment, property and other non-core equipment in the ordinary course of our business. Leases are classified as either operating leases or finance leases, as appropriate. Our leases have varying terms and may include renewal or purchase options, escalation clauses, restrictions, lease concessions, capital project funding, penalties or other obligations that we consider in determining minimum rental payments. We recognize lease expense for operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We recognize depreciation expense for finance leases over either the useful life of the asset or the lease term based on the terms of the lease agreement.
We are also party to 
three
 landfill operation and management agreements that we account for as operating leases. These agreements are long-term landfill operating contracts with government bodies whereby we receive tipping revenue, pay normal operating expenses and assume future final capping, closure and post-closure obligations. The government bodies retain ownership of each landfill. There are no bargain purchase options and title to each of the properties does not pass to us at the end of the respective lease terms. We allocate the consideration paid to the landfill airspace rights and underlying land lease based on the relative fair values. 
In addition to up-front or one-time payments, the landfill operating agreements may require us to make future minimum rental payments, including success or expansion fees, other direct costs and final capping, closure and post-closure costs. The value of all future minimum rental payments is amortized and charged to cost of operations over the life of the contract. We amortize the consideration allocated to airspace rights as airspace is utilized on a units-of-consumption basis and such amortization is charged to cost of operations as airspace is consumed (e.g., as tons are placed into the landfill). The underlying value of any land lease is amortized to cost of operations on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the respective operating agreement. 
73
Table of Contents
We recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for core leases classified as operating leases with a term in excess of 12 months in our consolidated balance sheets. For other non-core operating leases, which are comprised of small-dollar-value items such as office equipment, we expense these costs in the period incurred rather than capitalizing such expenditures on our consolidated balance sheets. We identify lease and nonlease components in a contract to which consideration in the contract will be allocated. We may elect by class of underlying asset to choose not to separate nonlease components from lease components and instead account for each separate lease component and the nonlease components in a contract as part of the single lease component. We have elected to not separate lease components from nonlease components for property leases and are, therefore, not allocating consideration between lease and nonlease components for this asset class. Lease payments include: fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments, less any lease incentives paid or payable to the lessee; variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate; exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised; penalties for terminating a lease; and amounts where it is probable that we will owe under a residual value guarantee. Refundable deposits are not considered to be a fixed payment. Variable lease costs that are not based on an index or a rate are recorded to expense in the period incurred. Lease term is determined at lease commencement and includes any noncancellable period for which we have the right to use the underlying asset together with any periods covered by an option to extend or terminate the lease if we are reasonably certain to exercise the option to extend or not to exercise the option to terminate. The initial determination of a lease liability is calculated as the net present value of the lease payments not yet paid. The discount rate used to determine present value is the rate implicit in the lease, if present, or, if not present, our incremental borrowing rate, which is a rate that reflects interest that we would have to pay to borrow funds on a collateralized basis over a similar term to the lease and in a similar economic environment. For shorter term leases, such as vehicle and equipment leases, we calculate our incremental borrowing rate using the interest rate from our existing secured line of credit, adjusted based on term. For longer term leases, such as our landfill operating leases, we calculate our incremental borrowing rate based on an industry yield curve with a similar credit rating, adjusted by a company specific spread as determined by a third party.
 See Note 8, 
Leases
 for further disclosure about lease costs and other lease information.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill.
 Goodwill is the excess of our purchase consideration over the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses. We do not amortize goodwill, but as discussed in the “
Asset Impairments
” accounting policy below, we assess our goodwill for impairment at least annually. See Note 9, 
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
 for disclosure about goodwill.
Intangible Assets.
 Intangible assets consist primarily of covenants not-to-compete, customer relationships, and trade names. Intangible assets are recorded at fair value and are amortized based on the economic benefit provided or using the sum of years digits or straight-line methods over their estimated useful lives. Covenants not-to-compete, customer relationships and trade names are typically amortized over a term of no more than 
10
 years.
 See Note 9, 
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
 for disclosure about intangible assets.
Investments in Unconsolidated Entities
Investments in unconsolidated entities over which we have significant influence over the investees’ operating and financing activities are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 
no
 investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Investments in affiliates in which we do not have the ability to exert significant influence over the investees’ operating and financing activities are accounted for under the cost method of accounting. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cost method investments totaling $
10,967
 and $
10,967
, respectively.
We monitor and assess the carrying value of our investments throughout the year for potential impairment and write them down to their fair value when other-than-temporary declines exist. Fair value is generally based on: (i) other third-party investors’ recent transactions in the securities; (ii) other information available regarding the current market for similar assets; and/or (iii) a market or income approach, as deemed appropriate.
When we assess the carrying value of our investments for potential impairment, determining the fair value of our investments is reliant upon the availability of market information and/or other information provided by third parties to be able to develop an estimate of fair value. Considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, our estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we, or other holders of these investments, could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different assumptions and/or estimation methodologies could have a significant effect on the estimated fair values. The estimates of fair value could differ significantly from the amounts presented.
 See 
“Asset Impairments”
 accounting policy below.
74
Table of Contents
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Our financial instruments include cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, accounts receivable, restricted investment securities held in trust on deposit with various banks as collateral for our obligations relative to our landfill final capping, closure and post-closure costs, interest rate derivatives, trade payables and debt. Accounting standards include disclosure requirements around fair values used for certain financial instruments and establish a fair value hierarchy. The three-tier hierarchy prioritizes valuation inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. Each fair value measurement is reported in one of three levels: Level 1, defined as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2, defined as inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
 See Note 11, 
Debt
 and Note 14, 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
 for fair value disclosure about debt and financial instruments, respectively. See the “
Derivatives and Hedging
” accounting policy below for the fair value disclosure about interest rate derivatives.
Business Combinations
We acquire businesses in the waste industry, including non-hazardous waste collection, transfer station, recycling and disposal operations, as part of our growth strategy. Businesses are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.
We recognize, separately from goodwill, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated acquisition-date fair values. We measure and recognize goodwill as of the acquisition date as the excess of: (a) the aggregate of the fair value of consideration transferred, the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree (if any) and the acquisition date fair value of our previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any), over (b) the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If information about facts and circumstances existing as of the acquisition date is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which a business combination occurs, we will report provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. The measurement period ends once we receive the information we were seeking; however, this period will not extend beyond one year from the acquisition date. Any material adjustments recognized during the measurement period will be recognized in the consolidated financial statements in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. All acquisition-related transaction and restructuring costs are to be expensed as incurred.
 See Note 5, 
Business Combinations
 and Note 17, 
Other Items and Charges 
for disclosure about business acquisitions and acquisition related expense, respectively
.
Environmental Remediation Liabilities
We have recorded environmental remediation liabilities representing our estimate of the most likely outcome of the matters for which we have determined that a liability is probable. These liabilities include potentially responsible party investigations, settlements, certain legal and consultant fees, as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up, such as materials and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy. We provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. We estimate costs required to remediate sites where it is probable that a liability has been incurred based on site-specific facts and circumstances. Estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are developed using third-party environmental engineers or other service providers. Where we believe that both the amount of a particular environmental remediation liability and timing of payments are reliably determinable, we inflate the cost in current dollars until the expected time of payment and discount the cost to present value.

Self-Insurance Liabilities and Related Costs
We are self-insured for vehicles and workers’ compensation with reinsurance coverage limiting our maximum exposure.  In fiscal year 2024, our maximum exposure per individual event under the workers’ compensation plan was $
1,500
. In fiscal year 2024, our minimum and maximum exposure per individual event under the automobile plan were up to $
2,000
 and $
4,200
, respectively. The liability for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, is determined by management with the assistance of a third-party actuary and reflected in our consolidated balance sheets as an accrued liability. We use a third party to track and evaluate actual claims experience for consistency with the data used in the annual actuarial valuation. The actuarial-determined liability is calculated based on historical data, which considers both the frequency and settlement amount of claims.
 Our self-insurance reserves totaled $
24,949
 and $
22,427
 as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly different than our ultimate obligations if variables such as the frequency or severity of future events differ significantly from our assumptions.

Income Taxes
We use estimates to determine our provision for income taxes and related assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances have been established for the possibility that tax benefits may not be realized for certain deferred tax assets. Deferred income taxes are recognized based on the expected future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, calculated using currently enacted tax rates. We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making this determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. In the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes.
We account for income tax uncertainties according to guidance on the recognition, derecognition and measurement of potential tax benefits associated with tax positions. We recognize interest and penalties relating to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense.
 See Note 16, 
Income Taxes
 for disclosure related to income taxes.
Derivatives and Hedging
We account for derivatives and hedging activities in accordance with derivatives and hedging accounting guidance that establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument (including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) be recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value. The guidance requires that changes in the derivative’s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. 
Our strategy to reduce exposure to interest rate risk involves entering into interest rate derivative agreements to hedge against adverse movements in interest rates related to the variable rate portion of our long-term debt. We have designated these derivative instruments as highly effective cash flow hedges, and therefore the change in their fair value is recorded in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax and included in interest expense at the same time as interest expense is affected by the hedged transactions. Differences paid or received over the life of the agreements are recorded as additions to or reductions of interest expense on the underlying debt and included in cash flows from operating activities.
 See Note 11, 
Debt 
for further disclosure about interest rate derivatives and Note 14, 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
 for fair value disclosure about derivative instruments. 
Contingent Liabilities
We are subject to various legal proceedings, claims and regulatory matters, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. We determine whether to disclose or accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote, reasonably possible or probable, and whether it can be reasonably estimated. We analyze our litigation and regulatory matters based on available information to assess the potential liabilities. Management’s assessment is developed based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies. We accrue for loss contingencies when such amounts are probable and reasonably estimable. If a contingent liability is only reasonably possible, we will disclose the potential range of the loss, if estimable. We record losses related to contingencies in cost of operations or general and administration expenses, depending on the nature of the underlying transaction leading to the loss contingency.
 See Note 12, 
Commitments and Contingencies
 for disclosure about loss contingencies, as applicable.

Revenue Recognition
We disaggregate our revenues by applicable service line: collection, landfill, transfer, transportation, landfill gas-to-energy, processing, and services provided by our National Accounts business. Under the revenue recognition guidance, revenues are measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer. The circumstances that impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized for each applicable service line may vary based on the nature of the service performed. We generally recognize revenues for services over time as we satisfy the performance obligation by transferring control over the service to the customer as the service is performed and the benefit is received and consumed by the customer. Services are typically delivered in a series as a single bundled performance obligation over either a designated period of time or for specified number of services. Services may also be delivered as a single bundled service, on a period-to-period basis, or in a spot transaction. Consideration may be variable on a per ton basis and/or fixed. Fixed consideration is allocated to each distinct service and variable consideration is allocated to the increment of time that the service is performed, and we have the contractual right to the fee. Fees are typically billed weekly, monthly, quarterly or in advance. Generally, the amount of consideration that we have the right to receive that is invoiced to the customer directly corresponds to the value of our performance completed to date. We do not disclose the amount of variable consideration included in the transaction price that is allocated to outstanding performance obligations when the variable consideration is allocated entirely to unsatisfied performance obligations or to a wholly unsatisfied promise to transfer a distinct good or service that forms part of a single performance obligation. Revenues that are not satisfied over time are recognized at a point-in-time. This typically includes the sale of recycled or organic materials, as well as renewable energy credits (“RECs”). Revenues from the sale of organic or recycled materials are recognized at a point-in-time as control of the materials transfers to the customer upon shipment or pick-up by the customer. Revenues from the sale of RECs are recognized at a point-in-time as the trade is executed and control transfers to the customer. 
Payments to customers that are not in exchange for a distinct good or service are recorded as a reduction of revenues. We make rebates to certain customers associated with payments for recycled or organic materials that are received and subsequently processed and sold to other third parties. Rebates are generally recorded as a reduction of revenues upon the sale of such materials, or upon receipt of the recycled materials at our facilities. We did not record revenues in fiscal years 2024, 2023, or 2022 from performance obligations satisfied in previous periods. 
Contract receivables, which are included in Accounts receivable, net, are recorded when billed or when related revenue is earned, if earlier, and represent claims against third parties that will be settled in cash. Accounts receivable, net includes receivables from contracts of $
162,916
 and $
158,931
 as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Certain customers are billed in advance and, accordingly, recognition of the related revenues for which payment has been received is deferred as a contract liability until the services are provided and control transferred to the customer. Contract liabilities of $
50,690
 and $
31,472
 as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, are presented separately on the consolidated balance sheets. Due to the short-term nature of advanced billings, substantially all of the deferred revenue recognized as a contract liability as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was recognized as revenue during fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively, when the services were performed.
 See Note 4, 
Revenue Recognition
 for disclosure over revenues by applicable service line.
Asset Impairments
Recovery of Long-Lived Assets.
 We continually assess whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that may warrant revision of the estimated useful lives of our long-lived assets (other than goodwill) or whether the remaining balances of those assets should be evaluated for possible impairment. Long-lived assets include, for example, capitalized landfill costs, property and equipment, identifiable intangible assets, and operating lease right-of-use assets. Events or changes in circumstances that may indicate that an asset may be impaired include the following:

•
a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or asset group;
•
a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition;
•
a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset or asset group, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator;
•
an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long-lived asset;
•
a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset or asset group; 
•
a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life; or
•
an impairment of goodwill at a reporting unit.
77
Table of Contents
There are certain indicators listed above that require significant judgment and understanding of the waste industry when applied to landfill development or expansion. For example, a regulator may initially deny a landfill expansion permit application although the expansion permit is ultimately granted. In addition, management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace. Therefore, certain events could occur in the ordinary course of business and not necessarily be considered indicators of impairment due to the unique nature of the waste industry.
If an impairment indicator occurs, we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows. We group our long-lived assets for this purpose at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are primarily independent of the cash flows of other assets or asset groups. If the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows, we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value.
To determine fair value, we use discounted cash flow analyses and estimates about the future cash flows of the asset or asset group. This analysis includes a determination of an appropriate discount rate, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and growth rates. The cash flows employed in our discounted cash flow analyses are typically based on financial forecasts developed internally by management. The discount rate used is commensurate with the risks involved. We may also rely on third-party valuations and or information available regarding the market value for similar assets.
If the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment occurs. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized.
Goodwill.
 We annually assess goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. 
We may assess whether a goodwill impairment exists using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment. If we perform a qualitative assessment, it involves determining whether events or circumstances exist that indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If based on this qualitative assessment we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we will not perform a quantitative assessment. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment, we perform a quantitative assessment to determine whether goodwill impairment exists at the reporting unit.
In testing for goodwill impairment, we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit, which we have determined to be our geographic operating segments and our Resource Solutions operating segment, and compare the fair value with the carrying value of the net assets of each reporting unit. If the fair value is less than its carrying value, then we would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, noting that the amount is not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. 
To determine the fair value of each of our reporting units as a whole we use discounted cash flow analyses, which require significant assumptions and estimates about the future operations of each reporting unit. Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the determination of appropriate discount rates, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and growth rates. The cash flows employed in our discounted cash flow analyses are based on financial forecasts developed internally by management. Our discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of our risk adjusted discount rate, applicable for each reporting unit. In assessing the reasonableness of our determined fair values of our reporting units, we evaluate our results against our current market capitalization.
If the fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value for a reporting unit, an impairment charge would be recorded to earnings. The loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. After a goodwill impairment loss is recognized, the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill becomes its new accounting basis.
In addition to an annual goodwill impairment assessment, we would evaluate a reporting unit for impairment if events or circumstances change between annual tests indicating a possible impairment. Examples of such events or circumstances include the following:

•
a significant adverse change in legal status or in the business climate;
•
an adverse action or assessment by a regulator;
•
a more likely than not expectation that an operating segment or a significant portion thereof will be sold; or 
•
the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within the operating segment.

Table of Contents
We elected to perform a quantitative analysis as part of our annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal year 2024. As of October 1, 2024, our Eastern, Western, Mid-Atlantic and Resource Solutions reporting units indicated that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount, including goodwill. In each case of our Eastern, Western, Mid-Atlantic and Resource Solutions reporting units, the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by in excess of 
23
%. We incurred 
no
 impairment of goodwill as a result of our annual goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years 2024, 2023 or 2022. However, there can be no assurance that goodwill will not be impaired at any time in the future. 
Cost Method Investments.
 We monitor and assess the carrying value of our cost method investments throughout the year for potential impairment and write them down to their fair value when other-than-temporary declines exist.
 We incurred 
no
 impairment of cost method investments in fiscal year 2024, 2023 or 2022. There can be no assurance that our cost method investments will not be impaired at any time in the future.
Defined Benefit Pension Plan 
We make contributions to 
one
 qualified multiemployer defined benefit pension plan (“Pension Plan”). The Pension Plan provides retirement benefits to participants based on their service. We do not administer this plan. The Pension Plan’s benefit formula is based on credited years of service and hours worked as defined in the Pension Plan document. Our pension contributions are made in accordance with funding standards established by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code, as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. The Pension Plan’s assets have been invested as determined by the Pension Plan's fiduciaries in accordance with the Pension Plan's investment policy. The Pension Plan’s asset allocation is based on the Pension Plan's investment policy and is reviewed as deemed necessary.
 See Note 15, 
Employee Benefit Plans
 for disclosure about the Pension Plan.
Stock-Based Compensation
Our equity awards granted generally consist of stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and market-based performance stock units. The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of restricted stock award and restricted stock unit grants is at a price equal to the fair market value of our Class A common stock at the date of grant. Compensation expense associated with our stock options, restricted stock awards and restricted stock units is recognized as expense in general and administration expense over the employee’s requisite service period. The fair value of market-based performance stock unit grants is valued using a Monte Carlo pricing model and compensation expense is recognized as expense in general and administration expense ratably over the performance period based on our estimated achievement of the established performance criteria. For purposes of calculating stock-based compensation expense, forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.
  See Note 13, 
Stockholders' Equity
 for disclosure about stock-based compensation.
Earnings per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the combined weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period and potentially dilutive shares. Dilutive shares include the assumed exercise of employee stock options, unvested restricted stock awards, unvested restricted stock units and unvested market-based performance stock units based on the expected achievement of performance targets. In computing diluted earnings per share, we utilize the treasury stock method.
 See Note 18, 
Earnings Per Share
 for disclosure about the calculation of earnings per share.
Subsequent Events
We have evaluated subsequent events or transactions that have occurred after the consolidated balance sheet date of December 31, 2024 through the date of this filing of the consolidated financial statements with the SEC on this Annual Report on Form 10-K and determined that, except as disclosed, there have been no material subsequent events that have occurred since December 31, 2024 through the date of this filing that would require recognition or disclosure in our consolidated financial statements.

REVENUE RECOGNITION
We disaggregate our revenues by applicable service line as follows: collection, landfill, transfer, transportation, landfill gas-to-energy, processing and National Accounts. 
Collection
Collection revenues are principally generated by providing waste collection and disposal services to our customers. Services may be provided as needed or as scheduled. We derive a substantial portion of our collection revenues from commercial, industrial and municipal services that are generally performed under service agreements or pursuant to contracts with municipalities. The majority of our residential collection services are performed on a subscription basis with individual property owners or occupants. 
Landfill
Landfill disposal services primarily consist of receiving some form of acceptable solid waste materials at one of our landfills and appropriately disposing of it. Landfill customers are typically charged a tipping fee on a per ton basis for disposing of their solid waste at our disposal facilities. In general, these fees are variable in nature.
Transfer station
Transfer station disposal services primarily consist of receiving some form of acceptable solid waste materials at one of our transfer stations and appropriately disposing of it by transporting it to an appropriate disposal site. Transfer station customers are charged a tipping fee on a per ton basis for disposing of their solid waste at our transfer stations. In general, these fees are variable in nature.
Transportation
Transportation services consist of the transportation of large volumes of waste or recycled materials from a customer designated location to another location or disposal facility. Transportation customers are charged a fee on a per ton basis for transporting and/or disposal of the materials. In general, these fees are variable in nature.
Landfill gas-to-energy
Landfill gas-to-energy services primarily consist of the generation and sale of electricity from landfill gas-to-energy facilities located at certain of our landfills; the generation and sale of renewable natural gas (“RNG”) from a landfill RNG facility; the reservation of electric generating capacity to be used by a customer on demand; and the sale of RECs.
Processing
Processing services consist of the receipt of recycled, sludge or other organic materials at one of our materials recovery, processing or disposal facilities, where it is then sorted, mixed and/or processed, and then disposed of or sold. Revenues from processing services are derived from customers in the form of processing fees, tipping fees, and commodity sales, primarily comprised of newspaper, corrugated containers, plastics, ferrous and aluminum, and organic materials such as our earthlife® soils products including fertilizers, composts and mulches.
National Accounts
Revenues from our National Accounts business are derived from brokerage services and overall resource management services providing a wide range of environmental services and resource management solutions to large and complex organizations, as well as traditional collection, disposal and recycling services provided to large account multi-site customers. In brokerage arrangements, we act as an agent that facilitates the sale of recyclable materials between an inbound customer and an outbound customer. Revenues from the brokerage of recycled materials are recognized on a net basis at the time of shipment. In general, these fees are variable in nature.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
In fiscal year 2024, we acquired 
eight
 businesses: 
four
 of which are in our Mid-Atlantic region, including the purchase of all the equity interests of Whitetail Disposal, Inc. and the assets of LMR Disposal, LLC, which together include collection operations in eastern Pennsylvania and western New Jersey; 
two
 of which are in our Western region, including the purchase of all equity interests of Royal Carting and Welsh Sanitation and related real estate assets, which consists of collection and transfer operations in the middle and lower Hudson Valley regions of New York as well as western Connecticut; and 
two
 of which are tuck-in operations in our Eastern region.
In fiscal year 2023, we acquired 
seven
 businesses: the equity interests of 
four
 wholly-owned subsidiaries of  GFL Environmental Inc., which include solid waste collection, transfer and recycling operations in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Delaware (the “GFL Acquisition”); the assets of Consolidated Waste Services, LLC and its affiliates (dba Twin Bridges), consisting of a collection, transfer and recycling business in the greater Albany, New York area (“Twin Bridges Acquisition”); and 
five
 additional solid waste collection businesses that provide collection, transfer and recycling services.
In fiscal year 2022, we acquired 
fourteen
 businesses primarily related to our solid waste collection, transfer, recycling and transportation operations. 
The operating results of these businesses acquired prior to December 31, 2024

have been included in the accompanying audited consolidated statements of operations from each date of acquisition, and each purchase price has been allocated to the net assets acquired based on fair values at the date of each acquisition with the residual amounts recorded as goodwill. Due to the integration of certain of these businesses within our existing market areas, it is not practicable to segregate the revenue and earnings of all of the acquired businesses since their respective acquisition dates. 
Purchase price allocations are based on information existing at the acquisition dates or upon closing the transactions. Acquired intangible assets other than goodwill that are subject to amortization may include customer relationships, trade names and covenants not-to-compete. These are amortized over a 
two
 to 
ten-year
 period from the date of acquisition. 
Goodwill acquired is primarily associated with the value of acquired businesses based on the current and anticipated operating performance of the business, in excess of the specific values allocated to other assets, new growth opportunities arising from the acquisitions, and expected synergies from combining the acquired businesses with our existing operations and implementing our operating strategies. Approximately $
120,754
 of goodwill associated with acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2024 is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

FINAL CAPPING, CLOSURE AND POST-CLOSURE COSTS
Accrued final capping, closure and post-closure costs include the current and non-current portion of costs associated with obligations for final capping closure and post-closure of our landfills. We estimate our future final capping, closure and post-closure costs in order to determine the final capping, closure and post-closure expense per ton of waste placed into each landfill as further described in Note 3, 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
. The anticipated time frame for paying these costs varies based on the remaining useful life of each landfill, as well as the duration of the post-closure monitoring period.

Credit Facility
In September 2024, we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement (“Credit Agreement”), which amended and restated in its entirety our amended and restated credit agreement (“Existing Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement provides for a $
800,000
 aggregate principal amount Term Loan Facility and a $
700,000
 Revolving Credit Facility, with a $
155,000
 sublimit for letters of credit (collectively, the “Credit Facility”). The proceeds of the Credit Facility refinanced our term loans under the Existing Credit Agreement, and may be used for working capital, permitted acquisitions, investments and dividends and distributions, and for other general corporate purposes. The Existing Credit Agreement included a $
430,000
 aggregate principal amount Term Loan A Facility entered into in June 2023 to partially fund the GFL Acquisition.
We have the right to request, at our discretion, an increase in the amount of loans under the Credit Facility by an aggregate amount of $
200,000
, subject to further increase based on the terms and conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Facility has a 
5-year
 term that matures in September 2029.
 The Credit Facility shall bear interest, at our election, at Term SOFR or at a base rate, in each case plus or minus any sustainable rate adjustment of up to positive or negative 
4.0
 basis points per annum, plus an applicable interest rate margin based upon our consolidated net leverage ratio as follows:
Term SOFR Loans
Base Rate Loans
Credit Facility
1.300
% to 
2.175
%
0.300
% to 
1.175
%
A commitment fee will be charged on undrawn amounts of our Revolving Credit Facility based upon our consolidated net leverage ratio in the range of 
0.20
% to 
0.40
% per annum, plus a sustainability adjustment of up to positive or negative 
1.0
 basis point per annum. The Credit Agreement provides that Term SOFR is subject to a 
zero
 percent floor. We are also required to pay a fronting fee for each letter of credit of 
0.25
% per annum. Interest under the Credit Agreement is subject to increase by 
2.00
% per annum during the continuance of a payment default and may be subject to increase by 
2.00
% per annum during the continuance of any other event of default. The Credit Facility is guaranteed jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally by all of our significant wholly-owned subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of our assets. As of December 31, 2024, further advances were available under the Credit Facility in the amount of $
675,403
. The available amount is net of outstanding irrevocable letters of credit totaling $
24,597
, and as of December 31, 2024 
no
 amount had been drawn. 
The Credit Agreement requires us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated net leverage ratio, to be measured at the end of each fiscal quarter. In addition to these financial covenants, the Credit Agreement contains a number of important customary affirmative and negative covenants which restrict, among other things, our ability to sell assets, incur additional debt, create liens, make investments, and pay dividends. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the Credit Agreement. An event of default under any of our debt agreements could permit some of our lenders, including the lenders under the Credit Facility, to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be immediately due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, or, in the case of the Credit Facility, terminate the commitment to make further credit extensions thereunder, which could, in turn, trigger cross-defaults under other debt obligations. If we were unable to repay debt to our lenders or were otherwise in default under any provision governing our outstanding debt obligations, our secured lenders could proceed against us and against the collateral securing that debt.
Tax-Exempt Financings
Industrial revenue bonds are tax-exempt municipal debt securities issued by a government agency on our behalf and sold only to qualified institutional buyers. As of December 31, 2024, we had outstanding $
277.0
 million aggregate principal amount of tax-exempt bonds in the states of New York, Vermont, Maine and New Hampshire (collectively, the “Industrial Revenue Bonds”), which are unsecured and guaranteed jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally by all of our significant wholly-owned subsidiaries, and require interest payments semi-annually. The Industrial Revenue Bonds have fixed rate interest periods. At the end of each respective fixed rate interest period, the corresponding tax-exempt bond may be converted to a variable rate interest period or remarketed over a new fixed rate interest period. We borrowed the proceeds of the Industrial Revenue Bonds to finance or reimburse certain qualified capital projects and other costs in each respective state of issuance as defined in the related offering memorandum and indenture. 
In fiscal year 2024, we completed the issuance of $
45,000
 aggregate principal amount of FAME Bonds 2024, $
25,000
 of which was restricted as of December 31, 2024 to be used for the repayment in full of FAME Bonds 2005R-3, which matured and were paid in January 2025. In fiscal year 2023, we completed the issuance of $
35,000
 aggregate principal amount of New York Bonds 2020R-2.

Debt Modification Expense
In fiscal year 2024, we recognized debt modification expense of $

 associated with agent fees and other third-party costs we paid during the refinancing of our Credit Agreement.
Loss from Termination of Bridge Financing
In fiscal year 2023, we wrote-off the unamortized debt issuance costs and recognized a loss from termination of bridge financing upon the extinguishment of both a secured bridge financing agreement in connection with the GFL Acquisition of $
3,718
, and an unsecured bridge financing agreement in connection with the Twin Bridges Acquisition of $
4,473
.
Cash Flow Hedges

Our strategy to reduce exposure to interest rate risk involves entering into interest rate derivative agreements to hedge against adverse movements in interest rates related to the variable rate portion of our long-term debt. We have designated these derivative instruments as highly effective cash flow hedges, and therefore the change in fair value is recorded in our stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax and included in interest expense at the same time as interest expense is affected by the hedged transactions. Differences paid or received over the life of the agreements are recorded as additions to or reductions of interest expense on the underlying debt and included in cash flows from operating activities.
A summary of the changes to the notional amount of interest rate derivative agreements follows:

Fair Value of Debt
As of December 31, 2024, the fair value of the Industrial Revenue Bonds was approximately $
276,503
 and the carrying value was $
277,000
. The fair value of the Industrial Revenue Bonds is considered to be Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy as the fair value is determined using market approach pricing provided by a third party that utilizes pricing models and pricing systems, mathematical tools and judgment to determine the evaluated price for the security based on the market information of each of the bonds or securities with similar characteristics. 
As of December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our Term Loan Facility was $
800,000
 and the carrying value of our Revolving Credit Facility was 
zero
 dollars. Their fair values are based on current borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements, or Level 2 inputs, and approximate their carrying values. 
Although we have determined the estimated fair value amounts of the Industrial Revenue Bonds using available market information and commonly accepted valuation methodologies, a change in available market information, and/or the use of different assumptions and/or estimation methodologies could have a material effect on the estimated fair values. These amounts have not been revalued, and current estimates of fair value could differ significantly from the amounts presented.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
In the ordinary course of our business and as a result of the extensive governmental regulation of the solid waste industry, we are subject to various judicial and administrative proceedings involving state and local agencies. In these proceedings, an agency may seek to impose fines or to revoke or deny renewal of an operating permit held by us. From time to time, we may also be subject to actions brought by special interest or other groups, adjacent landowners or residents in connection with the permitting and licensing of landfills and transfer stations, or allegations of environmental damage or violations of the permits and licenses pursuant to which we operate. In addition, we may be named defendants in various claims and suits pending for alleged damages to persons and property, alleged violations of certain laws and alleged liabilities arising out of matters occurring during the ordinary operation of a waste management business. The plaintiffs in some actions seek unspecified 
92
Table of Contents
damages or injunctive relief, or both. These actions fall within various procedural stages at any point in time, and some are covered in part by insurance. 
In accordance with FASB ASC 450 - Contingencies, we accrue for legal proceedings, inclusive of legal costs, when losses become probable and reasonably estimable. We have recorded an aggregate accrual of $
601
 relating to our outstanding legal proceedings as of December 31, 2024. As of the end of each applicable reporting period, we review each of our legal proceedings to determine whether it is probable, reasonably possible or remote that a liability has been incurred and, if it is at least reasonably possible, whether a range of loss can be reasonably estimated under the provisions of FASB ASC 450-20. In instances where we determine that a loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate a range of loss we may incur with respect to such a matter, we record an accrual for the amount within the range that constitutes our best estimate of the possible loss. If we are able to reasonably estimate a range, but no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other, we record an accrual in the amount that is the low end of such range. When a loss is reasonably possible, but not probable, we will not record an accrual, but we will disclose our estimate of the possible range of loss where such estimate can be made in accordance with FASB ASC 450-20. We disclose outstanding matters that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. See Note 17, 
Other Items and Charges
 for disclosure regarding a legal settlement charge recorded in fiscal year 2023.
Legal Proceedings 
North Country Environmental Services Expansion Permit
The permit for expansion of the Bethlehem, New Hampshire landfill of our subsidiary, North Country Environmental Services, Inc. (“NCES”), known as “Stage VI”, issued in October 2020 (“Permit”), was appealed by the Conservation Law Foundation (“CLF”) to the New Hampshire Waste Management Council (“Council”) on November 9, 2020 on the grounds it failed to meet the public benefit criteria. Following a hearing on the merits during which the Council found that the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (“DES”) had reasonably measured and acted lawfully in determining a capacity need for Stage VI, the hearing officer presiding over the proceedings issued an Order on May 11, 2022, without further hearing, determining instead that DES had acted unlawfully in reaching these conclusions (“Hearing Officer’s Order”), and remanded the Permit to DES on this determination. On December 5, 2022, DES and NCES both separately sought review of the Hearing Officer’s Order on appeal to the New Hampshire Supreme Court (“Supreme Court”). The parties presented oral arguments to the Supreme Court on October 3, 2023. On December 28, 2023, the Supreme Court issued a decision reversing the Hearing Officer's Order and held that the Stage VI Permit was lawfully issued by DES, fully resolving this matter and upholding the Stage VI Permit.
On December 14, 2022, NCES filed an action in Merrimack Superior Court (“Superior Court”) seeking to invalidate the Hearing Officer’s Order as having been adopted in violation of New Hampshire’s statute governing access to public records and meetings in that the Council did not hold a public meeting to deliberate on the Hearing Officer’s Order. The Superior Court dismissed that proceeding by Order dated April 6, 2023, and NCES appealed that decision to the Supreme Court on April 18, 2023. NCES’s brief on appeal was filed with the Supreme Court on August 11, 2023. On September 26, 2023, CLF filed a Motion to Intervene as well as a memorandum of law asking the Supreme Court to uphold the Superior Court’s dismissal, to which NCES filed an Objection in response on October 23, 2023. The Council filed its brief on October 25, 2023. On November 9, 2023, the Supreme Court issued an Order denying CLF’s Motion to Intervene but treating CLF’s memorandum of law as an amicus brief. NCES filed a reply brief on November 14, 2023. On January 18, 2024, the Supreme Court issued an Order setting a deadline of February 2, 2024 for the parties to submit memoranda addressing the mootness of this appeal in light of the Supreme Court’s December 28, 2023 Order reversing the Hearing Officer’s Order and upholding the Stage VI Permit. NCES subsequently filed a Motion for Vacatur of the Superior Court’s April 6, 2023 Order and a Memorandum in Response to the Supreme Court's February 2, 2024 Order on January 23, 2024. On March 18, 2024, the Supreme Court issued an order finding the appeal to be moot and vacating the Superior Court’s April 6, 2023 Order, resolving this matter.
On September 20, 2022, NCES, which has since withdrawn as a party, and our subsidiary, Granite State Landfill, LLC (“GSL”), filed a Petition for Declaratory Judgment (“Petition”) in the Superior Court asking the Superior Court for a determination of the meaning and constitutionality of New Hampshire’s public benefit requirement, the same statute at issue in the Hearing Officer’s Order. CLF was granted intervention in the Petition proceeding on June 8, 2023. On December 19, 2023, GSL filed a Motion To Stay pending the outcome of the Supreme Court’s consideration of the Stage VI Permit appeal. The Stage VI Permit appeal was decided and upheld by Order of December 28, 2023 as discussed above. As NCES prevailed in the Stage VI Permit appeal, GSL and NCES voluntarily non-suited the Petition on January 2, 2024, resolving this matter.
On April 12, 2023, DES issued approval of construction plans for Stage VI, Phase II to NCES (“DES Approval”). CLF appealed the DES Approval to the Council on May 11, 2023, on the grounds that it failed to meet the public benefit criteria, and that the DES Approval conflicts with the Hearing Officer’s May 11, 2022 Order determining that DES had acted unlawfully in issuing the Permit, and requested expedited review. The Council has denied CLF's request for expedited review. CLF withdrew its appeal by notice to the Council on February 7, 2024. In light of CLF's withdrawal of appeal, this matter is fully resolved.

North Country Environmental Services Letter of Deficiency
On June 14, 2024, NCES received a Letter of Deficiency (the “Letter”) from DES concerning alleged violations related to leachate management and leachate data and reporting. The Letter required certain actions to correct the deficiencies on a prescribed timeline, and NCES has met the deadlines for information submission. NCES has entered into preliminary discussions with the New Hampshire Department of Justice concerning an administrative order and associated penalties relative to the deficiencies. We believe that a liability related to this matter is probable and, accordingly, have recorded an accrual as of December 31, 2024. 
Environmental Remediation Liabilities
We are subject to liability for environmental damage, including personal injury and property damage, that our solid waste, recycling and power generation facilities may cause to neighboring property owners, particularly as a result of the contamination of drinking water sources or soil, possibly including damage resulting from conditions that existed before we acquired the facilities. We may also be subject to liability for similar claims arising from off-site environmental contamination caused by pollutants or hazardous substances if we or our predecessors arrange or arranged to transport, treat or dispose of those materials.
We accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when such costs become both probable and reasonably estimable. Determining the method and ultimate cost of remediation requires that a number of assumptions be made. There can sometimes be a range of reasonable estimates of the costs associated with remediation of a site. In these cases, we use the amount within the range that constitutes our best estimate. In the early stages of the remediation process, particular components of the overall liability may not be reasonably estimable; in this instance we use the components of the liability that can be reasonably estimated as a surrogate for the liability. It is reasonably possible that we will need to adjust the liabilities recorded for remediation to reflect the effects of new or additional information, to the extent such information impacts the costs, timing or duration of the required actions. Future changes in our estimates of the cost, timing or duration of the required actions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We disclose outstanding environmental remediation matters that remain unsettled or are settled in the reporting period that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
We inflate the estimated costs in current dollars to the expected time of payment and discount the total cost to present value using a risk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rates associated with our environmental remediation liabilities as of December 31, 2024 range between 
1.5
% and 
7.1
%.

Stock Based Compensation
Stock Incentive Plans
Amended and Restated 2016 Incentive Plan.
 In fiscal year 2024, our stockholders approved the amendment and restatement of our 2016 Incentive Plan (the “Amended 2016 Plan”). Under the Amended 2016 Plan, we may grant awards up to an aggregate amount of shares equal to the sum of: (A) 
4,000
 shares of Class A common stock (subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits and other similar events) which is comprised of: (i) 
1,750
 shares of Class A common stock reserved for the issuance in connection with the Amended 2016 Plan, plus (ii) 
2,250
 shares of Class A common stock originally reserved for issuance under the 2016 Incentive Plan; plus (B) such additional number of shares of Class A common stock (up to approximately 
2,723
 shares) as is equal to the sum of the number of shares of Class A common stock that remained available for grant under the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (“2006 Plan”) immediately prior to the expiration of the 2006 Plan and the number of shares of Class A common stock subject to awards granted under the 2006 Plan that expire, terminate or are otherwise surrendered, canceled, forfeited or repurchased by us. 
As of December 31, 2024, there were 
2,205
 Class A common stock equivalents available for future grant under the Amended 2016 Plan, inclusive of additional Class A common stock equivalents that were previously issued under terminated plans and have become available for grant because such awards expired or otherwise resulted in shares not being issued. 
Our equity awards granted primarily consist of stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and market-based performance stock units.
Stock options are granted at a price equal to the prevailing fair value of our Class A common stock at the date of grant. Generally, stock options granted have a term not to exceed 
ten years
 and vest over a 
one year
 to 
five-year
 period from the date of grant.
The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which uses a risk-free interest rate, based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve for the period of the expected life of the stock option; and requires extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimation, including estimates of: the expected term, calculated based on the weighted average historical life of the vested stock options, giving consideration to vesting schedules and historical exercise patterns; and the expected volatility, calculated using the weekly historical volatility of our Class A common stock over the expected life of the stock option.
Restricted stock awards and restricted stock units are granted at a price equal to the fair value of our Class A common stock at the date of grant. The fair value of each market-based performance stock unit is estimated using a Monte Carlo pricing model, which requires extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimation, including the estimated share price appreciation plus the value of dividends of our Class A common stock as compared to the Russell 2000 Index over the requisite service period.
Restricted stock awards granted to non-employee directors vest incrementally over a 
three-year
 period beginning on the first anniversary of the date of grant. Restricted stock units granted to non-employee directors vest in full on the first anniversary of the grant date. Restricted stock units vest incrementally over an identified service period beginning on the grant date based on continued employment. Market-based performance stock units vest at a future date following the grant date and are based on the attainment of performance targets and market achievements.

As of December 31, 2024, total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to outstanding restricted stock units was $

, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 
2.0
 years. As of December 31, 2024, total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to performance stock units based on our estimated achievement of the established performance criteria was $
5,032
, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 
1.7
 years. 
The weighted average fair value of market-based performance stock units granted during fiscal year 2024 was $
105.35
 per award, which was calculated using a Monte Carlo pricing model assuming a risk-free interest rate of 
4.3
% and an expected volatility of 
25.3
% assuming 
no
 expected dividend yield. Risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve for the expected service period of the award. Expected volatility is calculated using the daily volatility of our Class A common stock over the expected service period of the award.
The Monte Carlo pricing model requires extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimation. Application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different estimates of the fair value of stock-based compensation and consequently, the related amounts recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.
We also recorded $
607
, $

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
We use a three-tier fair value hierarchy to classify and disclose all assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, as well as assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, in periods subsequent to their initial measurement. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2, defined as inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. 
We use valuation techniques that maximize the use of market prices and observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. In measuring the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities, we rely on market data or assumptions that we believe market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability.
98
Table of Contents
Assets and Liabilities Accounted for at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
Our financial instruments include cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, accounts receivable, restricted investment securities held in trust on deposit with various banks as collateral for our obligations relative to our landfill final capping, closure and post-closure costs, interest rate derivatives, trade payables and debt. The carrying values of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, accounts receivable and trade payables approximate their respective fair values due to their short-term nature. The fair value of restricted investment securities held in trust, which are valued using quoted market prices, are included as restricted assets in the Level 1 tier below. The fair value of interest rate derivatives included in the Level 2 tier below is calculated using discounted cash flow valuation methodologies based upon Term SOFR yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals for the full term of the swaps. We recognize all derivatives accounted for on the balance sheet at fair value.
 See Note 11, 
Debt
 for disclosure about the fair value of debt.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
Defined Contribution Plan
We offer our eligible employees the opportunity to contribute to a 401(k) plan. Under the provisions of the 401(k) plans, participants may direct us to defer a portion of their compensation to a 401(k) plan, subject to Internal Revenue Code limitations. In fiscal year 2024, we provided an employer matching contribution for hourly employees equal to 
100
% of every dollar an employee invests up to 
1
% of annual income and 
50
% of additional employee contributions up to a maximum contribution into a 401(k) plan of 
3
% of annual income. In fiscal year 2024, we provided an employer matching contribution for salaried employees equal to 
50
% of every dollar an employee invests in a 401(k) plan up to a maximum contribution of 
one thousand five hundred
 dollars or up to 
2
% of annual income, whichever is greater, per employee per calendar year. Participants vest in employer contributions ratable over a 
two-year
 period. Employer contributions for fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022 amounted to $
5,831
, $
4,371
 and $
3,558
, respectively.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
We offer our eligible employees the opportunity to participate in an employee stock purchase plan. Under the ESPP, qualified employees may purchase shares of Class A common stock by payroll deduction at a 
15
% discount from the market price. In June 2023, our stockholders approved an amendment and restatement of the ESPP to increase the number of shares of Class A common stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP by 
400
 shares of Class A common stock. Class A common stock issued under our ESPP during fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022 amounted to 
30
, 
24
 and 
22
 shares, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, 
377
 shares of Class A common stock were available for distribution under our ESPP.
Defined Benefit Pension Plan
We contribute to a multiemployer defined benefit pension plan. The Pension Plan, under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement covers certain of our union represented employees. In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, we reached an agreement to withdraw from the Pension Plan by entering into Withdrawal and Re-entry Agreements with the Pension Plan. The withdrawal generated a fixed yearly contingent liability for us for a period of approximately seventeen (
17
) years, that capped our gross payments at $
4,224
, significantly reducing our cash exposure from the potential $
18,511
 withdrawal liability as determined based on a complete withdrawal prior to withdrawing from the Pension Plan. As of December 31, 2024, we had a remaining obligation of $
1,402
 in aggregate principal amount associated with our withdrawal. Upon re-entry as a new employer in the Pension Plan, our contributions are projected to fully fund the defined benefits accrued by our employees in the Pension Plan, thereby eliminating future accruals of withdrawal liability. As of December 31, 2024, our employees were fully funded, subject to the terms of the Withdrawal and Re-entry Agreements. Subsequent withdrawal from the Pension Plan, under certain circumstances, may result in a change in the payment schedule required to settle the remaining obligation associated with our withdrawal. During fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, we made contributions to the Pension Plan of $
500
, $
479
 and $
442
, respectively.

On a periodic basis, we reassess the valuation allowance on our deferred income tax assets, weighing positive and negative evidence to assess the recoverability of the deferred tax assets. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, we assessed the valuation allowance and considered positive evidence, including significant cumulative consolidated income over the three years ended December 31, 2024, revenue growth and expectations of future profitability, and negative evidence, including the impact of significant risks and uncertainties in the business and restrictions on tax loss utilization in certain state jurisdictions. We also considered the impact of acquisitions, including of Whitetail Disposal, Inc. and its integration into the company. After assessing both the positive evidence and the negative evidence, we determined it is more likely than not that certain state deferred tax assets would be realized in the future, and therefore released a portion of the valuation allowance as of December 31, 2024, resulting in a benefit from income taxes of $
3,166
. As of December 31, 2024, we maintained a valuation allowance of $
8,456
 primarily related to certain state net operating losses.
In assessing the realizability of carryforwards and other deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We adjust the valuation allowance in the period management determines it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will or will not be realized. The change in the valuation allowance for fiscal year 2024 was a decrease of $
2,530
. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, we have assessed the available means of recovering deferred tax assets, including the ability to carryback net operating losses, the existence of reversing temporary differences, and available sources of future taxable income. We have also considered the 
100
Table of Contents
ability to implement certain strategies, such as a potential sale of assets that would, if necessary, be implemented to accelerate taxable income and use expiring deferred tax assets.
The differences in the provision for income taxes and the amounts determined by applying the Federal statutory rate to income before income taxes are as follows:

The net deferred tax liability at December 31, 2024 is reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as a long-term deferred federal and state tax liability of  $(
19,089
).
As of December 31, 2024, we have, for federal income tax purposes, net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $
83,211
, which do not expire. We have state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $
125,708
 that expire in the fiscal years ending December 31, 2025 through 2044 or that do not expire in certain jurisdictions. In addition, we have $
3,900
 general business credit carryforwards which expire in the fiscal years ending December 31, 2025 through 2044 and 
zero
 state credit carryforwards. Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code can limit the amount of net operating loss and credit carryforwards which may be used in a tax year in the event of certain stock ownership changes.
The provisions of FASB ASC 740-10-25-5 prescribe the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. Additionally, FASB ASC 740-10-25-5 provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. Under FASB ASC 740-10-25-5, an entity may only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a “more likely than not” threshold. To the extent interest and penalties are not assessed with respect to uncertain tax positions, amounts accrued are reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we did 
no
t have any uncertain tax positions.
We are subject to U.S. federal income tax, as well as the income tax of multiple state jurisdictions. For federal tax purposes, income tax returns from years ending 2021 through 2024 are open for assessment. Tax years 1999 through 2020 are open for examination to the extent of any NOLs or credits that have been carried forward from those years.

OTHER ITEMS AND CHARGES
Landfill Capping (Recovery) Charge - Veneer Failure
In fiscal year 2023, we recorded a charge of $
3,870
 consisting of both (i) the write-off of historical payments associated with capping work that was deemed no longer viable due to a veneer failure and (ii) the related operating expenses incurred to clean up the affected capping material at the Ontario County Landfill that we operate. In fiscal year 2024, we recorded a recovery of $(
1,739
) consisting of both (i) a partial reversal of historical payments written off after an engineering evaluation determined that a portion of the area affected by the veneer failure was deemed to still be viable as well as (ii) a recovery of operating expenses incurred during the clean up of the affected capping material as part of a settlement with a third party. See Note 10, 
Final Capping, Closure and Post-Closure Costs 
for disclosure over our remaining estimated costs associated with obligations for final capping closure and post-closure of our landfills. 
Southbridge Landfill Closure Charge
In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, we initiated a plan to cease operations of the Southbridge Landfill and later closed it in November 2018 when the Southbridge Landfill reached its final capacity
.

242
, $
241
 and $
141
, respectively. 
Leases
In the fiscal year ended April 30, 1994, we entered into 
two
 leases for operating facilities with a partnership of which John Casella, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Douglas Casella, a member of our Board of Directors, are the general partners. The lease related to our corporate headquarters in Rutland, Vermont has been extended through February 2039 and the lease associated with our Montpelier, Vermont facility has been extended through May 2039. The terms of the lease agreements require monthly payments of approximately $
34
, subject to a fixed annual escalation. Total expense charged to operations for fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022 under these agreements was $

Landfill Post-closure
We have agreed to pay the cost of post-closure on a landfill owned by John Casella, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Douglas Casella, a member of our Board of Directors. We paid the cost of closing this landfill in 1992, and the post-closure maintenance obligations are expected to last until notified by the permitting authority. In fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, we paid $
14
, $
3
 and $
10

20.     
SEGMENT REPORTING
We report selected information about our reportable operating segments in a manner consistent with that used for internal management reporting. We classify our solid waste operations on a geographic basis through 
three
 regional operating segments, our Eastern, Western and Mid-Atlantic regions. Revenues associated with our solid waste operations are derived mainly from solid waste collection and disposal services, including landfill, transfer station and transportation, while also providing landfill gas-to-energy and processing services in the eastern United States. Our Resource Solutions operating segment leverages our core competencies in materials processing, industrial recycling, organics and resource management service offerings to deliver a comprehensive solution for our larger commercial, municipal, institutional and industrial customers that have more diverse waste and recycling needs. Revenues associated with our Resource Solutions are comprised of processing services and services provided by our National Accounts business. Revenues from processing services are derived from customers in the form of processing fees, tipping fees, commodity sales, and organic material sales. Revenues from our National Accounts business are derived from brokerage services and overall resource management services providing a wide range of environmental services and resource management solutions to large and complex organizations, as well as traditional collection, disposal and recycling services provided to large account multi-site customers. Legal, tax, information technology, human resources, certain finance and accounting and other administrative functions are included in our Corporate Entities segment, which is not a reportable operating segment. Operating income by segment reported in fiscal years 2023 and 2022 have been updated to conform with the presentation for fiscal year 2024, which does not have Corporate Entities costs allocated to our reportable operating segments. See Note 9, 
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
 for the breakout of goodwill by reportable operating segment. 
The accounting policies of our reportable operating segments are the same as those described in Note 3, 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
. Our President is our CODM. Our CODM uses operating income in evaluating reportable operating segment performance in order to properly allocate resources and make key operating decisions. Intercompany revenue and expenses are eliminated in the computation of consolidated gross revenues and operating income.
The CODM uses operating income for each reportable operating segment in the annual budget and forecasting process and considers budget-to-actual and forecast-to-actual variances on a monthly basis when making decisions about the allocation of operating and capital resources to each reportable operating segment.
Summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments for fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, follows:

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
None.

Table of Contents
ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to our management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework in 2013. Based on its assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by RSM US LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. RSM US LLP has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.
We completed the acquisitions of LMR Disposal LLC, Roxburg Station LLC and AMP Holdings LLC (collectively “LMR”) on July 1, 2024; the equity interests of Whitetail Disposal, Inc. (“Whitetail”) on August 1, 2024; Royal Carting Holdings Corp., Welsh Sanitation Holdings Corp., Panichi Holding Corp., Valley 82 Holding Corp., Kejem Properties, LLC, Hopewell Industrial Properties LLC, Milbrook Properties LLC, and Watch Hill Holding Corp. (collectively, “Royal”) on October 1, 2024; and Tiger Waste Disposal Services, Inc. and Gra-Jen Properties, LLC (collectively “Tiger”) on December 2, 2024. Since we have not yet fully incorporated the internal controls and procedures of the LMR, Whitetail, Royal and Tiger from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. Collectively, the LMR, Whitetail, Royal and Tiger constituted approximately 16% of our total assets as of December 31, 2024 and 5% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
No change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION
Director and Officer Trading Arrangements
A portion of the compensation of our directors and officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”)) is in the form of equity awards, including restricted stock units and performance stock units, and, from time to time, directors and officers engage in open-market transactions with respect to the securities acquired pursuant to such equity awards or other securities of ours, including to satisfy tax withholding obligations when equity awards vest or are exercised, and for diversification or other personal reasons.
Transactions in our securities by directors and officers are required to be made in accordance with our insider trading policy, which requires that the transactions be in accordance with applicable U.S. federal securities laws that prohibit trading while in possession of material nonpublic information. Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act provides an affirmative defense that

The following table describes, for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, each trading arrangement for the sale or purchase of our securities adopted or terminated by our directors and officers that is either (1) a contract, instruction or written plan intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) (a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement”) or (2) a “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” (as defined in Item 408(c) of Regulation S-K):
