Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Annual Report on Form 10-K (this “Annual Report”), including the information incorporated herein by reference, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as “anticipate,” “appear,” “approximate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “foresee,” “intends,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “possible,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “seek,” “should,” “would” and other similar words and expressions (or the negative version of such words or expressions) may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. 
The forward-looking statements are based on the current expectations of Payoneer Global Inc.’s (“Payoneer”) management and are inherently subject to uncertainties and changes in circumstances and their potential effects and speak only as of the date of such statement. There can be no assurance that future developments will be those that have been anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: (1) changes in applicable laws or regulations; (2) the possibility that Payoneer may be adversely affected by geopolitical events and conflicts, such as Israel’s ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, and other economic, business and/or competitive factors, such as trade policies (including tariffs); (3) changes in the assumptions underlying Payoneer’s financial estimates; (4) the outcome of any known and/or unknown legal or regulatory proceedings; and (5) other factors described under the heading “Risk Factors” discussed and identified in public filings made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) by Payoneer.

Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize or should any of the assumptions made by the management of Payoneer prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements.
All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements concerning the matters addressed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and attributable to Payoneer or any person acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except to the extent required by applicable law or regulation, Payoneer undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.
