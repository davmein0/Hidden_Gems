Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that you should be aware of in evaluating our business. If any such risks and uncertainties actually occur, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The risks described below are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. The risk factors described below should be read together with the other information set forth in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes, as well as in other documents that we file with the SEC.
Summary of the Material Risks Associated with Our Business
These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:
●
Our success depends on our ability to develop products and services to address or adapt to the rapidly evolving markets that we serve, and if we are not able to implement successful enhancements and new features for our platform, products and services, we could lose customers or have trouble attracting new customers, and our ability to grow may be limited.
●
If our counterparty financial institutions, banking partners or payment processors seek to terminate or adversely change our relationship due to regulatory, policy, commercial, our failure to comply with the applicable requirements of our counterparty, or any other reason, it may materially adversely affect our business.
●
Declines in e-commerce utilization generally, and any factors that reduce cross-border trade or cross-border digital commerce, make such trade or commerce more difficult or diminish e-commerce sales and/or limit activity of e-commerce marketplaces, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
●
Our failure to appropriately manage our customer funds, and our ability to retain and grow customer funds balances, could materially harm our business or our results of operations.
●
We are subject to risks associated with changes in interest rates, including their impact on interest income revenue and the market value of our time deposits and U.S. Treasury Securities, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
●
Our business may be materially adversely affected by geopolitical and other risks associated with global operations. As we continue to expand internationally, including within emerging markets, we may become more susceptible to these risks.
●
If we fail to comply with the applicable rules and policies of the payment network card schemes or the terms of a payment network card scheme license, they could seek to fine us, suspend us or terminate our participation license, as applicable, which could materially adversely affect our business. 
●
If a marketplace were to prevent our customers from using our services to receive payments from such marketplace, or if we are unable to renew certain marketplace and enterprise customer contracts or to adjust certain contract components at favorable terms or we lose a significant enterprise or marketplace customer, our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.
●
Substantial and increasingly intense competition in the worldwide financial services and payments industry, including on pricing and payment alternatives, could materially adversely affect our margins, business and results of operations. Competitive activity by our partners and enterprise customers that insource payment services or directly compete against our services could materially adversely affect our business.
●
Failure to effectively deal with bad, fraudulent or fictitious transactions and material internal or external fraud could materially negatively impact our business.
●
Use of our payment services for illegal purposes could materially harm our business.
●
Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities, unauthorized disclosure, destruction or modification of data, through cybersecurity breaches, computer viruses or otherwise, or disruption of our services, can result in material harm to our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. 
●
We rely on third parties to provide services and could be materially adversely impacted if they fail to fulfill their obligations or if our arrangements with them are terminated and suitable replacements cannot be found on commercially reasonable terms or at all.
●
Our business depends on our strong and trusted brand, and failure to maintain and protect our brand, or any damage to our reputation, or the reputation of our partners, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

●
Our systems and our third-party providers’ systems may be subject to system failures or capacity constraints, and resulting interruptions in the availability of our platform, products, or services, including the accessibility of our solutions through mobile devices, could materially harm our business.
●
Our business is subject to laws, rules, regulations, policies and legal interpretations in the markets in which we operate, including (but not limited to) those governing cross-border and domestic money transmission, foreign exchange, privacy, data protection, deposit taking, factoring, stored value and payment services (including payment processing and settlement services). The legal and regulatory requirements applicable to us are extensive, complex, frequently changing, and increasing in number, and may impose overlapping and/or conflicting requirements or obligations in a variety of jurisdictions. Failure to comply could subject us to significant fines and other material adverse consequences.
●
Failure to comply with anti-money laundering, anti-bribery, economic and trade sanctions regulations and similar laws, could subject us to penalties and other material adverse consequences. 
●
As a significant portion of our revenue is generated from China, any negative impact to our ability to serve customers based in China could materially adversely affect our results and exacerbate the other risks set forth herein.
​
The summary risk factors described above should be read together with the text of the full risk factors below and in the other information set forth in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes, as well as in other documents that we file with the SEC. 
​
Risks Related to Our Business and Industry
Our success depends on our ability to develop products and services to address or adapt to the rapidly evolving markets that we serve, and if we are not able to implement successful enhancements and new features for our platform, products and services, we could lose customers or have trouble attracting new customers, and our ability to grow may be limited.
The markets for our products and services are characterized by constant and rapid technological changes, (including increasing adoption and development of artificial intelligence), frequent introduction of new products and services, and increasing customer expectations. Our ability to update our platform, to enhance our current products and services and to develop and introduce innovative products and services can significantly affect our future success. We may not be successful in developing, marketing or selling new products and services or in updating our platform in a way that meets these demands or achieve market acceptance. We must anticipate and respond to these changes in order to remain competitive within our relevant markets. Our ability to continue to develop innovative products and services for our customers could have an impact on our ability to retain customers and on their continued use of our platform. In addition, developing new and competitive services and offerings in response to industry-wide standards, including those related to safety and security, as well as evolving regulatory requirements, may require significant investment. If we are unable to anticipate or respond or adapt to technological or regulatory changes or evolving industry standards and demands on a timely basis, our ability to remain competitive, and our results of operations, could be materially adversely affected. 
In addition, the success of certain of our products and services relies, in part, on marketplaces and other third parties offering or allowing the use of our products and services by their customers. If we are unsuccessful in offering products or services that gain market acceptance and compete effectively, or if marketplaces cease to offer or allow our products and services to their merchants or refuse to pay their merchants through our products and services, it would likely have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain existing customers, to attract new ones and to grow profitably.
If our counterparty financial institutions, banking partners or payment processors seek to terminate or adversely change our relationship due to regulatory, policy, commercial, our failure to comply with the applicable requirements of our counterparty, or any other reason, it may materially adversely affect our business.
We are dependent on our relationships with a number of third-party financial institutions, banking partners and payment processors to support our operations, with services such as collection, payment, processing and clearing, and settlement for the transactions we service, as well as holding and disbursement of customer funds. Without these relationships, we would not be able to process payments or settle transactions in relevant markets. 
In the event our agreement or relationship with a third-party financial institution, bank partner or payment processor is terminated or adversely changes due to regulatory, policy, commercial, our failure to comply with the applicable requirements of our counterparty, or any other reason, or if upon its expiration we are unable to renew the agreement on terms favorable to us, or at all, it may be difficult for us to replace these services which may materially adversely affect our operations and profitability.  
14

Table of Contents
These agreements and relationships may give our counterparties substantial discretion in approving certain aspects of our business practices, including our application and qualification procedures for customers and require us to comply with certain legal and operational requirements. Discretionary actions of our counterparties under these agreements and relationships could impose material limitations to, or have a material adverse effect on, our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, our financial results could be materially adversely affected if our costs associated with such relationships materially change or if any penalty or claim for damages which may be material is imposed as a result of our breach of the agreement with them or their other requirements. These relationships are also subjects to the risks associated with third-party service providers and vendors in general, as more fully described elsewhere in this Risk Factors section. 
In addition, given we have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents, receivables and other current and non-current assets outstanding, including assets underlying our customer balances and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the United States and other countries in which we operate, we may be, and have been, exposed to the risk of default by, or deteriorating operating results or financial condition or failure of, these counterparty financial institutions. The risk of counterparty default, deterioration, or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one or more of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to access or recover our assets that are deposited, held in accounts with, or otherwise due from, such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings, as has previously occurred, and we could incur significant losses or suffer reputational damage, which could materially and negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.
Declines in e-commerce utilization generally, and any factors that reduce cross-border trade or cross-border digital commerce, make such trade or commerce more difficult or diminish e-commerce sales and/or limit activity of e-commerce marketplaces, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We generate significant portions of our volume by processing online payments from marketplaces and e-commerce platforms to merchants and generate significant portions of our revenues from merchants’ utilization of the payments they receive. Any decline in e-commerce utilization or cross-border trade or cross-border digital commerce could materially adversely affect our business. The extent of such impact will depend on a variety of highly uncertain factors any of which could lead to a decrease in e-commerce utilization or cross-border trade or cross-border digital commerce, including general macroeconomic trends and global economic conditions, such as inflation and recessionary conditions impacting business and consumer spending, changes in government regulation, users’ access to the internet, user preference, consumer behavior, actual or perceived online security concerns or the effects of widespread health epidemics. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic drove a shift in buying patterns from brick-and-mortar stores to e-commerce, while the reopening of economies, coupled with inflation, supply chain disruptions and consumer purchasing behavior changes, drove a softening in e-commerce growth rates.
In addition, cross-border trade (i.e., transactions where the merchant and buyer are in different countries) is imperative to our business as a source of revenue and profits. Cross-border transactions generally provide payment providers higher revenues and operating income than similar transactions that take place within a single country or market. Cross-border trade also represents our primary (and in some cases, our only) presence in certain important markets. Cross-border trade is subject to, and may be negatively impacted by, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as other macro-economic conditions and governmental and other actions that restrict or otherwise impact such cross-border trade. In addition, the interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions (e.g., the jurisdiction of the merchant and of the buyer) are often extremely complicated in the context of cross-border trade and foreign exchange. Changes to or the interpretation and/or application of laws and regulations applicable to cross-border trade and foreign exchange could further impose additional requirements and restrictions, increase costs, and present conflicting obligations. Any factors that increase the costs of cross-border trade for us or our customers or that restrict, delay, or make cross-border trade more difficult or impractical, such as trade policies or higher tariffs (as recently threatened or imposed by certain countries, including the U.S.), and general macroeconomic trends and global economic conditions, could reduce our cross-border transactions and volume, materially and negatively impact our revenues and profits and materially harm our business.
Our failure to appropriately manage our customer funds, and our ability to retain and grow customer funds balances, could materially harm our business or our results of operations. 
We hold a substantial amount of funds belonging to our customers, including balances in customer accounts and funds in process of being remitted, at third-party financial institutions in the form of either demand deposits, time deposits, or U.S. Treasury Securities. We hold, and in certain jurisdictions are required to hold and segregate, eligible liquid assets equal to at least 100% of the aggregate amount of all customer funds held by our licensed entities. Our ability to manage and accurately account for the assets underlying our 
15

Table of Contents
customer funds and comply with applicable liquid asset requirements and applicable regulations requires a high level of internal controls. As our business continues to grow and we expand our product offerings, we must continue to strengthen our associated internal controls. Our continued success requires that our customers have confidence in our ability to properly manage customer balances and handle large and growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds. Any failure to maintain the necessary controls or to appropriately manage our customer funds in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements could result in reputational harm, lead customers to discontinue or reduce their use of our products, to withdraw funds held with us and could result in significant penalties and fines and additional restrictions, each of which could materially harm our business and could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
Since we transfer and hold large amounts of funds for our customers, our trustworthiness and reputation are fundamental to our business. The occurrence of any operational disruptions or errors due to, for example, software defects, service disruptions, employee misconduct, security breaches, or other similar actions, omissions or errors on our platform could result in material financial losses to our business and our customers, damage to our reputation, or termination of our agreements with financial institutions and partners, each of which could result in loss of customers; lost or delayed market acceptance and sales of our platform; legal claims against us; regulatory enforcement action; or diversion of our resources, including through increased service expenses or financial concessions, and increased insurance costs. There can be no assurance that the insurance we maintain will be available or sufficient to cover any losses. If we suffer significant losses or reputational harm as a result, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
When customers seek access to their cash balances, our primary source of liquidity is comprised of our demand deposits held at financial institutions. The availability of these funds could be impacted by the financial condition of the institutions within our network of providers. Given the above, and since we hold the funds underlying our customer balances with multiple banks globally, we are also subject to the risks described elsewhere in this Risk Factor section that relate to the reliance on services provided by third parties and the dependency on banks and other financial institutions. 
Additionally, and in connection with our interest rate risk management strategy implemented in 2024, changes in interest rates affect the market value of our time deposits and U.S. Treasury Securities. As market interest rates change, we could face a scenario where our time deposits and U.S. Treasury Securities would be redeemable at a price below their carrying value. In addition, interest rate changes that result in material realized or unrealized differences in the fair value of our time deposits and U.S. Treasury Securities versus their carrying value, could negatively impact market and customer perceptions of the Company, potentially leading to increased withdrawals of funds which could materially impact our operations.  
In addition, as noted elsewhere in our Risk Factors, our success depends on our ability to develop products and services to address or adapt to the rapidly evolving markets that we serve, including our ability to implement successful enhancements and new features for our platform, products and services.  If we are unable to do so, we could lose customers or have trouble attracting new customers, and this, as well as macro-economic and geopolitical conditions more generally, including those factors discussed further elsewhere in our Risk Factors, each could result in a decline in customer balances, which would reduce our revenue from interest income and could materially adversely impact our results of operations.
We are subject to risks associated with changes in interest rates, including their impact on interest income revenue and the market value of our time deposits

and U.S. Treasury Securities, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
A portion of our earnings are derived from interest income earned on both corporate funds and customer funds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, of particular relevance for us, the Federal Reserve. Between 2022 and 2023, the Federal Reserve raised the benchmark interest rate by 525 basis points, which benefitted our earnings during the year ended December 31, 2023. In 2024, we continued to benefit from relatively higher interest rates in the U.S., while also the U.S. Federal Reserve cut the benchmark interest rate by 100 basis points and there remains uncertainty as to the timing and magnitude of future interest rate changes. Any future decline in interest rate levels may reduce our ability to earn interest income on customer balances and/or corporate funds. While any such decline in interest rates may, generally speaking, be expected to encourage growth in economic activity, including consumer and business spending, this may not be sufficient to offset any adverse effect on our results of operations. 
As further discussed above, changes in interest rates could affect the market value of our time deposits and U.S. Treasury Securities such that they are redeemable at a price below their carrying value.

Our business may be materially adversely affected by geopolitical and other risks associated with global operations. As we continue to expand internationally, including within emerging markets, we may become more susceptible to these risks.
Our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Operating in or providing services to customers in foreign countries, including Israel, Greater China and other Asian countries, Ukraine and other European countries, subjects us to multiple risks that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, including:
●
geopolitical events, including acts of war, nationalism and terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues (such as the COVID-19 pandemic and its variants), social unrest or human rights issues;
●
differing local product preferences and product requirements;
●
partial or total expropriation of international assets;
●
economic sanctions and trade protection measures, including tariffs (as recently threatened or imposed by certain countries), import-export restrictions, or boycotts;
●
differing enforceability and protection of intellectual property and contract rights;
●
different, uncertain, or more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy, and other laws; and
●
potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws or policies.
For example, the war in Ukraine and the subsequent economic sanctions imposed on Russia, Belarus and certain territories in Ukraine have, and may continue to negatively impact our revenue derived from services provided to customers from impacted countries. In addition, our banking partners ceased their operations in Russia, and subsequently we ceased to provide services to customers in Russia, and we have limited our payment services to Belarus customers. It is not possible to predict the broader consequences of this conflict, but the continuation or further escalation of the conflict, along with any expansion to surrounding areas, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
Additionally, approximately 55% of our global employee base, including certain management members and approximately 78% of our research and development resources, are employed by our Israeli subsidiary, Payoneer Research & Development Ltd. Accordingly, political, economic, military, and regional conflict conditions in Israel and the surrounding region may directly affect our business and operations. Since October 7, 2023, Israel has been at war with Hamas and Hezbollah, and exchanged attacks with Iran and other proxies of the regime. The state of the ongoing conflict remains highly uncertain and could worsen or expand which can further impact economic conditions and activity in Israel, the region and the broader global economy, including revenues from customers located in the region. Our operations could be disrupted by, for example, the prolonged absence of a large number of employees due to Israel military service call-ups. While revenues derived from customers based in Israel were insignificant for the year ended December 31, 2024, and, at this time, an insignificant portion of our Israeli workforce have been called to military reserve duty, further escalation, expansion, or prolonged continuation of the conflict may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Violations of the complex foreign and United States laws, rules and regulations that apply to our international operations, including violations of any sanctions, can result in fines which may be material, criminal actions, or sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, or other enforcement actions; prohibitions or limits on the conduct of our business; the diversion of operational resources; and damage to our reputation. Our policies and procedures may not be effective in preventing violations by our employees, contractors, vendors or agents. These risks are inherent in our international operations and their expansion may increase our costs of doing business internationally, and could materially harm our business, results, and reputation. In addition, we may from time to time undertake projects and make investments in countries in which we have little or no previous investment or operating experience. We may not be able to fully or accurately assess the risks of investing in such countries, or may be unfamiliar with the laws and regulations in such countries governing our investments and operations. As a result, we may be unable to effectively implement our strategy in new jurisdictions. Investment opportunities in certain jurisdictions also may be restricted by legal limits on foreign investment in local assets or classes of assets.

If we fail to comply with the applicable rules and policies of the payment network card schemes or the terms of a payment network card scheme license, they could seek to fine us, suspend us or terminate our participation license, as applicable, which could materially adversely affect our business.
Payoneer (through our subsidiary) is licensed by Mastercard as a card issuer and is engaged with other Mastercard-licensed card issuers and is registered as a card program manager. Payoneer is also (through subsidiaries) registered as a payment facilitator with Mastercard and Visa and is engaged and registered with several acquirers as a merchant. As such, we are subject to card association and network rules that could subject us to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by the card associations or networks for certain acts or omissions by us. In addition, we are subject to the Payment Card Industry (“PCI”) Data Security Standard enforced by the major card brands, and are listed with Mastercard as an SDP compliant service provider.
The failure to comply with these rules can result in the imposition of monetary fines which may be material, and our member registrations or certifications could be suspended or terminated. The suspension or termination of our member registrations or certifications, or any changes to the association and network rules, that we do not successfully address, or any other action by the card networks to restrict our ability to process transactions over such networks, could limit our ability to provide transaction processing services to customers and result in a significant reduction of revenue or increased costs of operation, which, in either case, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our removal from networks’ lists of Data Security Standard compliant service providers could mean that existing customers, partners or other third parties may cease using or referring our services. Also, prospective customers, partners or other third parties may choose not to consider us for their processing needs. In addition, the card networks could refuse to allow us to process through their networks. Any of the foregoing could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Changes to these network rules or how they are interpreted could have a material impact on our business and financial results. For example, from time to time, card associations and debit networks, including the card networks which we operate under, increase the processing and other fees (including what is commonly known as “interchange fees”) that they charge. It is possible that competitive pressures will result in us absorbing a portion of such increases in the future, or result in us not being able to increase our own fees, which would increase our operating costs, reduce our profit margin, limit our growth, and may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the various card associations and networks prescribe certain capital requirements. Any increase in the capital level required would further limit our use of capital for other purposes. Future changes to or interpretations of the network rules that are inconsistent with the way we currently operate may require us to make changes to our business that could be costly or difficult to implement. If we fail to make such changes, the networks could pass on fines and assessments in respect of fraud or chargebacks related to our customers or disqualify us from processing transactions if satisfactory controls are not maintained, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
If a marketplace were to prevent our customers from using our services to receive payments from such marketplace, or if we are unable to renew certain marketplace and enterprise customer contracts or to adjust certain contract components at favorable terms or we lose a significant enterprise or marketplace customer our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.
A significant portion of our revenues is derived from SMBs and entrepreneurs that sell on or through large marketplaces and enterprise customers ecosystems. The loss of business associated or connected with a large marketplace or ecosystem could materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the payments our customers received from Amazon marketplaces around the world generated 23% of our revenues during the year ended December 31, 2024, and accordingly, should Amazon change eligibility or other requirements for approved payment service providers on its platforms such that we are negatively impacted, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely impacted. For more information, please see Note 2 – Significant Accounting Policies, “Concentration of Risks”, to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.
Our relationships with marketplaces and enterprises serve as an important component of our customer acquisition infrastructure. Our ability to acquire new customers could be materially harmed if we are unable to access these ecosystems, or enter into or maintain these relationships on terms that are commercially reasonable to us, or at all. In addition, to the extent we renew our existing marketplace and enterprise customer contracts or are required to adjust certain terms or components in existing contracts, such renewals or adjustments may be on less favorable terms than our existing contracts. The above can materially impact revenue, expenses, profitability, and earnings. With certain of our marketplaces and enterprise customers, we utilize certain incentive structures to compensate the marketplace or enterprise for customer acquisition. As a result, the nature and profitability of these arrangements can vary throughout the periods of their term, which can materially impact our results of operations.

Substantial and increasingly intense competition in the worldwide financial services and payments industry, including on pricing and payment alternatives, could materially adversely affect our margins, business and results of operations. Competitive activity by our partners and enterprise customers that insource payment services or directly compete against our services could materially adversely affect our business.
The global payments industry is highly competitive, rapidly changing, highly innovative, and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny and oversight. We compete against a wide range of businesses, including those that are larger than we are, serve consumers as well as businesses to increase revenues, have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, or a dominant or more secure position, or offer other products and services to customers that we do not offer, as well as smaller or younger companies that may be more agile in responding quickly to regulatory and technological changes. 
Many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies (including artificial intelligence), shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Competition also may intensify as businesses enter into business combinations and partnerships, which may include periods of exclusivity, and established companies in other segments expand to become competitive with different aspects of our business. In addition, some payment service provider competitors, including those focused on certain peer to peer business cases or specific regional corridors, may choose to become direct participants in local payment schemes, allowing them to offer more attractive fees and therefore to more effectively compete for certain segments or corridors compared to us. Competition could result in a loss of existing customers, and greater difficulty attracting new customers. Furthermore, if competition causes us to reduce the fees we charge in order to attract or retain customers, there is no assurance we can successfully control our costs in order to maintain our profit margins. One or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
There are a number of payment service providers that offer global payment services, including global treasury banks that serve large corporate accounts; small local banks that focus on serving local SMBs; FX companies that focus on serving SMB importers and exporters; global digital payment platforms like PayPal, Ant Group, Airwallex or Wise; global card networks; Neobanks; SMB-focused business-to-business (“B2B”) payment providers like Bill.com; mass payout service providers that specialize in providing services to enterprises and marketplaces; SMB AP/AR SaaS providers; merchant service providers like Adyen, Braintree and Stripe; and local payment service providers that focus on enabling SMBs in one or more local markets to sell on digital marketplaces globally. In China, for example, we face a highly competitive market with a combination of global digital payment platforms such as WorldFirst and Airwallex and local payment providers including PingPong and LianLian. We are also facing competitive pressure from non-traditional payment service providers and other parties entering the payments industry, such as Google, Apple, Alibaba, Amazon and Meta, who compete in one or more of the functions performed on our payment platform. These companies have significant financial resources and robust networks and are highly regarded by consumers. If these companies gain a greater share of total e-commerce payment transactions or if we are unable to successfully react to changes in the industry spurred by the entry of these new market participants, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum; blockchain based payment systems like Ripple; and central bank digital currencies, all have the potential to be used to support cross-border payments and could offer alternatives to businesses and other users and become more significant competition in the future. 
If we are not able to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors, price our products competitively, provide added value to our customers, or effectively and efficiently align our resources with our goals and objectives, we may not be able to compete effectively in the market.
Failure to effectively deal with bad, fraudulent or fictitious transactions and material internal or external fraud could materially negatively impact our business.
We have been, and may in the future be, subject to liability for fraudulent transactions, including electronic payments and card transactions or credits initiated by customers. Examples of fraud include when a party knowingly uses a stolen or counterfeit credit, debit or prepaid card, card number or other credentials to record a false sales transaction, processes an invalid card or intentionally fails to deliver the merchandise or services sold in an otherwise valid transaction. In addition, we are subject to the risk that our employees, counterparties or third-party service providers commit fraudulent activity against us or our customers. Bad actors and criminals around the world are using increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities, including those involving personal data, such as counterfeiting, account takeover, fraud, unauthorized use of another’s identity or payment information, unauthorized acquisition or use of credit or debit card details and other fraudulent use of another’s identity or information. It is possible that incidents of fraud could increase in the future. Failure to effectively manage risk and prevent fraud, or otherwise effectively administer our chargeback responsibilities, would increase our chargeback liability and exposure to fines or other liabilities and could result in the loss of banking relationships or other operational relationships or expose us to the other risks associated with 
19

failure or perceived failure to comply with regulations described elsewhere in this Risk Factors section. The above could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Use of our payment services for illegal purposes could materially harm our business.
We offer our payment services to a large number of customers. We are responsible for vetting and monitoring these customers and determining whether the transactions we process for them are lawful and legitimate. In configuring our services, we face an inherent trade-off between security and customer convenience. Our payment services are susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, illegal online gambling, fraudulent sales of goods or services, illegal sales of marijuana and related business products, pharmaceuticals, cigarettes, weapons, obscene or pornographic materials, or the facilitation of other illegal activity. In addition, the highly automated nature of, and liquidity offered by, our payment services make us a target for illegal or improper uses, including fraudulent or illegal sales of goods or services, money laundering, and terrorist financing. Identity thieves and those committing fraud using stolen or fabricated credit card or bank account numbers, or other deceptive or malicious practices, including the hacking of bank accounts, can potentially steal significant amounts of money from businesses like ours. 
When our products and services are used to process illegitimate transactions, and we settle those funds to recipients and are unable to recover them, we suffer losses and liability. The use of our payment services for illegal or improper uses has and may from time to time subject us to fines which may be material, claims, or government and regulatory investigations, inquiries, or requests that could result in liability and reputational harm for us. These types of illegitimate, as well as unlawful, transactions can also expose us to governmental and regulatory sanctions in various jurisdictions (including U.S. anti-money laundering and economic sanctions violations). Certain activity that may be legal in one jurisdiction may be illegal in another jurisdiction, and a customer may be found responsible for intentionally or inadvertently importing or exporting illegal goods, resulting in liability for us. Changes in applicable laws and regulations have increased the penalties for intermediaries providing payment services for certain illegal activities, and government authorities may consider additional payments-related proposals from time to time. Owners of intellectual property or government authorities may seek to bring legal action against providers of payments solutions, including Payoneer, that may provide payment services in connection with the sale of products that actually or allegedly infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate intellectual property. Any threatened or resulting claims could result in reputational harm, and any resulting liabilities, loss of transaction volume, or increased costs could materially harm our business.
Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities, unauthorized disclosure, destruction or modification of data, through cybersecurity breaches, computer viruses or otherwise, or disruption of our services, can result in material harm to our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.
In conducting our business, we collect, process, transmit, store, use and share sensitive business information and personally identifiable information (“PII”) about our customers, financial institution partners, vendors, and other parties. This information may include account access credentials, credit and debit card numbers, bank account numbers, social security numbers, passport/ID numbers, driver’s license numbers, names and addresses and other types of sensitive business information or PII, including copies of documents thereof. Some of this information is also collected, processed, stored, used, shared and transmitted by our software and financial institution partners, third-party service providers to whom we outsource certain functions and other vendors. We are subject to a number of legal requirements, regulations, contractual obligations and industry standards regarding security, data protection and privacy and any failure to comply with these requirements, regulations, obligations or standards could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and operating results. We also have certain responsibilities to payment networks and their member financial institutions for any failure, including the failure of our associated third-party service providers, to protect this information. Information security risks for financial and technology companies such as ours have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other external parties. Because of our position in the payments value chain, we believe that we are likely to continue to be a target of such threats and attacks. Additionally, geopolitical events and resulting government activity could also lead to information security threats and attacks by affected jurisdictions and their sympathizers. As artificial intelligence capabilities continue to evolve, they may be used to identify vulnerabilities and craft sophisticated cybersecurity attacks. Vulnerabilities may be introduced from the use of artificial intelligence by us, our customers, vendors and other business partners and third-party providers. If these attempts are successful it could lead to the compromise of sensitive or confidential business information or PII.
In addition, our products, services and customers may themselves be targets of cyberattacks that attempt to sabotage or otherwise disable them, and the defensive and preventative measures we take ultimately may not be able to effectively detect, prevent, or protect against or otherwise mitigate losses from all cyberattacks. We have in the past, and may in the future, be the target of malicious third-
20

Table of Contents
party attempts to identify and exploit system vulnerabilities, and/or penetrate or bypass our security measures, in order to gain unauthorized access to our platform and systems. Our computer systems could be, and the computer systems of our third-party service providers and software partners, as well as those of other entities, have been and in the future could be subject to breaches, and our data protection measures may not prevent unauthorized access. These attempts can lead to the compromise of sensitive or confidential business information or PII or result in the accounts of our customers being otherwise compromised, leading to financial losses to our customers or to our business. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and are often difficult to detect. The systems and procedures we have in place to defend against intrusion and attack and to protect our data may not be sufficient to counter all current and emerging technology threats.
In addition, increased remote operations creates an additional risk of attack while decreasing our ability to monitor. Threats to our systems and associated third-party systems can originate from human error, fraud or malice on the part of employees or third-parties, or simply from accidental technological failure. Computer viruses and other malware can be distributed and could infiltrate our systems or those of third-party service providers. In addition, denial of service attacks, phishing scams, social engineering, ransomware theft, cyber-attacks created through or due to use of artificial intelligence or other attacks could be launched against us or our customers for a variety of purposes, including to interfere with our services or create a diversion for other malicious activities. Our defensive measures and training may not prevent unplanned downtime, unauthorized access or unauthorized use of sensitive business data or PII. 
Any such breach or attack could compromise our platform, creating system disruptions or slowdowns and exploiting security vulnerabilities of our products and services. Additionally, in case of such breach, the information stored on our platform could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen, which could subject us to substantial liability and cause us material financial harm. These breaches, or any perceived breach, may also result in damage to our reputation, negative publicity, loss of key business relationships and sales, increased costs to remedy any problem (including repairing system damage, increasing security protection costs by deploying additional personnel and modifying or enhancing our protection technologies and investigating and remediating any information security vulnerabilities), regulatory inquiries and investigations, customer complaints and costly litigation and legal expenses, and may therefore adversely impact market acceptance of our products and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Further, while we select our third-party service providers carefully, we do not control their actions and we cannot provide assurance that the contractual requirements related to security and privacy that we impose on our service providers who have access to customer data will be followed or will be adequate to prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of such data. Any problems experienced by these third-parties, including those resulting from breakdowns or other disruptions in the services provided by such parties or cyber-attacks and security breaches, could materially adversely affect our ability to service our customers or otherwise conduct our business.
Our cyber errors and omissions insurance coverage that covers certain aspects of cyber risks may be insufficient to cover all losses. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us in this regard that exceed our available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also cannot ensure that our existing insurance coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims related to a security incident or breach, or that the insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim.
Use of technologies based on artificial intelligence by our employees, whether authorized or unauthorized, may increase the risk that PII, our intellectual property and other proprietary information will be unintentionally disclosed, compromised, or that we may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. We could also be subject to liability for claims relating to misuse of PII, such as unauthorized marketing purposes and violation of consumer protection or data privacy laws. In addition, federal, state and foreign rules and regulations may require us to notify authorities as well as individuals of data security incidents involving certain types of PII or information technology systems. In addition, we have agreed in certain agreements to take certain protective measures to ensure the confidentiality of customer data. The costs of systems and procedures associated with such protective measures may increase and could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. Any failure to adequately enforce or provide these protective measures could result in liability, protracted and costly litigation, governmental and card network intervention and fines and, with respect to misuse of PII of our customers, lost revenue and reputational harm.
Any type of security breach, attack or misuse of data, whether experienced by us or an associated third-party, could harm our reputation or deter existing or prospective customers from using our services, increase our operating expenses in order to contain and 
21

Table of Contents
remediate the incident, expose us to unbudgeted or uninsured liability, disrupt our operations (including potential service interruptions), divert management focus away from other priorities, increase our risk of regulatory scrutiny, result in the imposition of penalties and fines under state, federal and foreign laws or by card schemes and adversely affect our regulatory licenses and banking relationships. Further, if we were to be removed from networks’ lists of Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, our existing customers and financial institution partners or other third parties may cease using our services.
We rely on third parties to provide services and could be materially adversely impacted if they fail to fulfill their obligations or if our arrangements with them are terminated and suitable replacements cannot be found on commercially reasonable terms or at all.
We depend on third-party service providers and vendors for certain products and services, including components of our computer systems, software, data centers, risk tools and telecommunications networks, to conduct our business. Any changes in these systems that degrade the functionality of our products and services, impose additional costs or requirements, or give preferential treatment to competitors’ services, including their own services, could materially adversely affect usage of our products and services. 
Some of these third-party service providers and vendors provide similar services and technology to our competitors, and we do not have long-term or exclusive contracts with them. Our systems and operations or those of our third-party service providers and software providers could be exposed to damage or interruption from, among other things, fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, unauthorized entry, computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks, cyber-attacks, acts of terrorism, human error, vandalism or sabotage, financial insolvency, bankruptcy and similar events. In addition, we may be unable to renew our existing contracts with our most significant service providers or they may stop providing or otherwise supporting the products and services we obtain from them, and we may not be able to obtain these or similar products or services on the same or similar terms as our existing arrangements, if at all. Our third-party service providers might fail to perform their obligations and provide the products and services we obtain from them in a timely manner for any reason. The above could materially adversely affect our operations and profitability due to, among other consequences: loss of revenues; loss of customer data, including PII; fines imposed by payment networks; harm to our business or reputation resulting from negative publicity; exposure to fraud losses or other liabilities; additional operating and development costs; or diversion of management, technical and other resources.
Our business depends on our strong and trusted brand, and failure to maintain and protect our brand, or any damage to our reputation, or the reputation of our partners, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
We have developed a strong and trusted brand that has contributed significantly to the success of our business. We believe that maintaining and promoting our brand in a cost-effective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our products and services and expanding our base of customers and partners.
Maintaining and promoting our brand will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful, reliable, secure, and innovative products and services, as well as our ability to maintain trust and remain a global financial services leader. We may introduce, or make changes to, features, products, services, privacy practices, pricing, content, collaborations, or terms of service that customers do not like, which may materially adversely affect our brand. Our brand promotion activities may not generate customer awareness or increase revenue, and even if they do, any increase in revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in building our brand. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business could be materially adversely affected.
Harm to our brand can arise from many sources, including failure by us or our partners and service providers to satisfy expectations of service and quality, inadequate protection or misuse of PII, compliance failures and claims, bad actors which target Payoneer or its customers, litigation and other claims, smear campaigns, and misconduct by our partners, customers or other counterparties. We have been, from time to time and, may in the future be, the target of incomplete, inaccurate, and misleading or false statements about our company and our business that could damage our brand and deter customers from adopting our services. Any negative publicity about our industry or our company, the quality and reliability of our products and services, our compliance and risk management processes, changes to our products and services and their terms, our ability to effectively manage and resolve customer complaints, our privacy, data protection, and information security practices, litigation, regulatory licensing and infrastructure, and the experience of our customers with our products or services could adversely affect our reputation and the confidence in and use of our products and services. If we do not successfully maintain a strong and trusted brand, our business could be materially adversely affected.

Inflation can have a material adverse effect on our business and our customers.
Inflation can have a major impact on our results of operations. Inflation decreases the value of money and can erode the purchasing power of individuals and businesses, making it more difficult for them to afford goods and services, and requiring them to spend a larger share of their wallet on essential purchases. Therefore, the growth in the e-commerce market and cross-border trading may be adversely affected by a high inflation environment, such as the one seen in the U.S. in recent years, which can be further exacerbated by macroeconomic changes (such as the tariffs recently imposed or threatened by certain countries), and subsequently the volumes flowing through our platforms and earnings can be materially adversely impacted. Additionally, high or rapidly increasing inflation can also lead to uncertainty and instability in financial markets in general, which can materially adversely impact our financial performance.
Global pandemics and other major public health crises may materially impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 Global pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other global public health issues may materially and variably impact our operations and the operations of our customers and business partners locally and globally, and therefore our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For example, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, we were adversely affected by a decline in global travel and volatile global economy, while at the same time benefited from an increase in e-commerce transactions. The extent and materiality of such impact will depend on developments that are highly uncertain and difficult to predict, including, but not limited to, the duration, location and spread of an outbreak or crises, its severity, the actions to contain the pandemic or crises or treat its impact, the way an outbreak and the remedial measures taken in response affect consumer sentiment and spending behavior, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. 
As our revenue has increased, our growth rate has slowed at times in the past and may slow or decline in the future. Future revenue growth depends on our ability to retain existing customers, attract new customers, and increase sales to both new and existing customers.
Our rate of revenue growth has slowed at times in the past and may decline in the future, and it may slow or decline more quickly or materially than we expect for a variety of reasons, including as a result of the risks described herein. Our customers have no obligation to continue to use our services, and we cannot assure you that they will. The difficulty and costs associated with switching to a competitor may not be significant for many of the services we offer. Our customers’ payment processing activity with us may decrease for a variety of reasons, including customers’ level of satisfaction with our products and services, our pricing and the pricing and quality of competing products or services, the effects of global economic conditions, or reductions in the level of buyers transacting with our customers.
In addition, the growth of our business depends in part on existing customers expanding their use of our products and services. If we are unable to encourage customers to broaden their use of our services, our growth may slow or stop, and our business may be materially adversely affected. The growth of our business also depends on our ability to attract new customers, to encourage larger customers to use our products and services, and to introduce successful new products and services. We have invested and will continue to invest in improving our platform in order to offer better or new features, products and services, but if those features, products and services fail to be successful, our growth may materially slow or decline.
We have a past history of net losses, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.
While we recorded net income for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we incurred a net loss of $12.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. We intend to continue to make significant capital and marketing investments in our business to support and drive growth. Each initiative may not result in increased revenue or growth on a timely basis or at all. Such initiatives include increasing spending on new and existing products and services. If we are unable to generate adequate revenue growth and manage our expenses, our results of operations and operating metrics may fluctuate and we may incur material losses, which could cause the market price of our common stock to materially decline. 
Failure to protect, enforce and defend our intellectual property rights, which may diminish our competitive advantages or interfere with our ability to market and promote our products and services, and claims that we infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate third parties’ intellectual property rights, could have a material adverse effect on our business. We also use open-source software and may be subject to claims from licensors related to ownership and use rights.

Table of Contents
Our trademarks, trade names, trade secrets, know-how, proprietary technology and other intellectual property are important to our future success. We believe our trademarks and trade names are widely recognized and associated with quality and reliable service. While it is our policy to protect and defend our intellectual property rights vigorously, we cannot predict whether the steps we take to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent infringement, misappropriation, dilution or other potential violations of our intellectually property rights. We also cannot guarantee that others will not independently develop technology with the same or similar functions to any proprietary technology we rely on to conduct our business and differentiate ourselves from our competitors. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop applications with the same functionality as our solutions, and policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult and may not be effective. 
Furthermore, we have in the past and may in the future face trademark registration objections, or claims of infringement, misappropriation or other violation of third-party intellectual property rights that could interfere with our ability to market and promote our brands, products and services. The risk of future claims of infringement or misappropriation may increase as we deploy artificial intelligence capabilities within our platform. Any litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or defend ourselves against claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, even those without merit and regardless of the outcome, could be costly, divert attention of management and may not ultimately be resolved in our favor. Moreover, if we are unable to successfully defend against claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others, we may be prevented from using or required to redesign certain intellectual property, pay substantial amounts to satisfy judgments or settle claims or lawsuits, obtain a license to continue commercializing or using the applicable technologies, products and services, pay substantial royalty or licensing fees, satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with certain parties with whom we have commercial relationships, or may be liable for damages, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Intellectual property laws, procedures, and restrictions provide only limited protection and any of our intellectual property or proprietary rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated. While software and other of our proprietary works may be protected under copyright law, we have chosen not to register any copyrights in these works, and instead, primarily rely on protecting our software as a trade secret. In order to bring a copyright infringement lawsuit in the United States, the copyright must be registered with the United States Copyright Office. Accordingly, the remedies and damages available to us for unauthorized use of our software may be limited.
We attempt to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information by requiring our employees, consultants and certain of our contractors to execute confidentiality and invention assignment agreements. However, we may not obtain these agreements in all circumstances, and individuals with whom we have these agreements may not comply with their terms. The assignment of intellectual property rights under these agreements may not be self-executing or the assignment agreements may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims that they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property. In addition, we may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical know-how or other trade secrets by the parties to these agreements despite the existence generally of confidentiality agreements and other contractual restrictions. Monitoring unauthorized uses and disclosures is difficult and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary technologies will be effective.
In addition, we use open-source software in connection with our proprietary software and expect to continue to use open-source software in the future. Some open-source licenses require licensors to provide source code to licensees upon request, prohibit licensors from charging a fee to licensees or require licensors to make available any derivative works of the open-source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost, and we may be subject to such terms. We cannot guarantee that we can successfully insulate our proprietary code from the effects of such open-source license provisions. Accordingly, we may face claims from others claiming ownership of, or seeking to enforce the license terms applicable to such open-source software, including by demanding release of the open-source software, derivative works or our proprietary source code that was developed or distributed with such software. In addition to risks related to license requirements, use of certain open-source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open-source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of software. There is little legal precedent in this area and any actual or claimed requirement to disclose our proprietary source code or pay damages for breach of contract could materially harm our business and could help third parties, including our competitors, develop products and services that are similar to or better than ours.
These claims could also result in litigation, require us to purchase a costly license or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our software. In addition, if the license terms for the open-source code change, we may be forced to re-engineer our software or incur additional costs. Any of the above could have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.

Our products and services may not function as intended due to errors in our or our third-party providers’ software, hardware, and systems, product defects, or due to security breaches or human error in administering these systems, which could materially adversely affect our business.
Our services are based on sophisticated software and computer systems and we may encounter delays when developing new applications and services. Further, our or our third-party providers’ software may contain undetected vulnerabilities, errors or defects. In addition, we may experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technology on systems or with other programs used by our third-party providers. Defects in our or our third-party providers’ software, errors or delays in the processing of electronic transactions or other difficulties could result in interruption of business operations, delay in market acceptance, additional development and remediation costs, diversion of technical and other resources, loss of customers or customer data, negative publicity or exposure to liability claims. Although we attempt to limit our potential liability through disclaimers and limitation of liability provisions in our license and other agreements, we cannot be certain that these measures will successfully limit our liability.
Additionally, electronic payment products and services, including ours, have been, and could continue to be in the future, specifically targeted, and could be penetrated or disrupted by hackers, as described elsewhere in this section. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to data, products, and services and to disable, degrade, or sabotage them change frequently and may be difficult to detect or remediate for long periods of time, we and our customers may be unable to anticipate these techniques to implement adequate preventative measures to stop them. If we, our customers or third-party service providers are unable to anticipate or prevent these attacks, our customers’ businesses may be harmed, our reputation could be damaged, and we could incur significant liability.
Our systems and our third-party providers’ systems may be subject to system failures or capacity constraints, and resulting interruptions in the availability of our platform, products, or services, including the accessibility of our solutions through mobile devices, could materially harm our business.
Our systems and those of our third-party providers, including data center facilities, may experience service interruptions, cyberattacks and other security incidents, including as a result of human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, other natural disasters, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks and other geopolitical unrest, computer viruses, changes in social, political or regulatory conditions or in laws and policies, or other changes or events. Our systems and facilities are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, and acts of vandalism. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster-recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities. In addition, as a provider of payments solutions and other financial services, we are subject to increased scrutiny by regulators that may require specific business continuity and disaster recovery plans and more rigorous testing of such plans. This increased scrutiny may be costly and time-consuming and may divert our resources from other business priorities.
We have experienced and will likely continue to experience denial-of-service and other cyberattacks, system failures, security incidents, and other events or conditions that interrupt the availability or reduce the speed or functionality of our products and services. These events may result in material loss of revenue. In addition, they could result in significant expense to repair or replace damaged equipment and remedy resultant data loss or corruption. A prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the speed or other functionality of our products or services could materially harm our reputation and business. Frequent or persistent interruptions in our products and services could cause customers to believe that our products and services are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid our products and services, and could permanently harm our reputation and business. Moreover, we have in the past, and may in the future, be subject to claims by customers seeking compensation arising as a result of temporary system inoperabilities. Future claims, even if unsuccessful, could be time-consuming and costly for us to address.
A significant natural or man-made disaster could have a material adverse impact on our business. The insurance we maintain may not be sufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses that could result from disruptions to our services. Significant natural or other disasters could also have a material adverse impact on our sellers, which, in the aggregate, could in turn materially adversely affect our results of operations.
Our risk management framework, including our counterparty risk management, may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure against all types of risks.
We operate in a rapidly changing industry. Accordingly, our risk management policies and procedures may not be fully effective to identify, monitor and manage risks our business encounters due to the likelihood and velocity of existing risks occurring and the rise of new risks. In addition, when we introduce new services, focus on new business types, or begin to operate in markets where we 
25

Table of Contents
have a limited history of fraud loss, we may be less able to forecast and reserve accurately for those losses. If our policies and procedures are not fully effective or we are not successful in identifying and mitigating all risks to which we are or may be exposed, we may suffer uninsured liability, harm to our reputation or be subject to litigation or regulatory actions that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. For example, if our security measures prove insufficient, our business may be materially adversely affected. 
Our risk management policies, procedures, techniques, and processes may not be sufficient to identify all of the risks to which we are exposed, to enable us to mitigate the risks we have identified, or to identify additional risks to which we may become subject in the future. As a greater number of larger merchants and customers use our services, we expect our exposure to material or significant losses from a single merchant or customer, or from a small number of merchants or customers, to increase. Moreover, we rely on third-party service providers, such as non-financial institutions and payment service providers, and our risk management policies and processes may not be sufficient to monitor compliance by such third parties with applicable laws and regulations, including anti-money laundering laws. We may incur significant costs with respect to monitoring third-party service providers. Furthermore, if our risk management policies and processes contain errors or are otherwise ineffective, we may suffer large financial losses, we may be subject to civil and criminal liability, and our business may be materially adversely affected.
Our results of operations may be materially adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
We are subject to risks related to changes in currency rates as a result of our international operations and multi-currency customer transactions and from revenues generated in currencies other than the United States dollar. These risks include transaction risk, which occurs when the exchange rate we offer to customers differs from the rate at which we execute corresponding trades with financial institutions, leading to potential gains or losses. This risk is further impacted by timing mismatches, bulk currency purchases for liquidity management, and internal customer balance conversions that are not immediately offset by external bank transactions. We also manage translation risk, as we hold assets (primarily cash in banks) and liabilities (primarily customer balances) in multiple currencies, which are revalued into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. Any of the above may materially adversely affect our reported financial position and results of operations. 
In addition, our ability to optimize foreign exchange revenues as part of the payment delivery process may be adversely affected due to foreign exchange market and regulatory conditions outside of our control, as a result of which revenue and profit may materially decrease as compared to prior periods. In addition, we may become subject to exchange control regulations that restrict or prohibit the conversion of our foreign revenue currencies into United States dollars. Any of these factors could decrease the value of revenues and earnings we derive from our international operations and have a material adverse effect on our business.
Changes and evolving requirements in tax laws or their interpretation, including as applied to us and our customers, could have a material adverse affect on our business.
As a multinational organization operating in multiple jurisdictions, including but not limited to the U.S., the EU, the UK, Israel, Hong Kong, Singapore, India and China, we are subject to increasingly complex tax laws and regulations in several jurisdictions, the application of which can be uncertain. The amount of taxes we are required to pay in these jurisdictions could increase substantially as a result of changes in the applicable tax principles, including increased tax rates, new tax laws, or revised interpretations of existing tax laws, potential disputes around transfer prices implemented and precedents, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Such material adverse effect may include the value of any tax loss carryforwards, tax credits recorded on our balance sheet, the amount of our cash flow, our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.
An increasing number of jurisdictions have enacted, or are planning to enact, tax legislation consistent with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) proposal for a global minimum tax of 15% on reported profits (Pillar Two of the OECD Model Rules). Such legislation is generally effective for tax years beginning January 1, 2024. While existing legislation related to a global minimum tax did not adversely impact our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2024, our effective tax rate and cash tax payments may be adversely affected in future years as a result of these changes. 
Many of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business have detailed transfer pricing rules, which require contemporaneous documentation establishing that all transactions with non-resident related parties be priced using arm’s length pricing principles. Tax authorities in these jurisdictions could challenge our related party transfer pricing policies and, consequently, the tax treatment of corresponding expenses and income. If any tax authority were to be successful in challenging our transfer pricing policies, we may be liable for additional corporate income tax, withholding tax, indirect tax and penalties and interest related thereto, which may have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
26

Table of Contents
We are subject to regular review and audit by the relevant tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate and as a result, the authorities in these jurisdictions could review, and in some cases are reviewing, our tax returns and may impose additional significant taxes, interest and penalties, challenge the transfer pricing policies adopted by us, claim that our operations constitute a taxable presence in different jurisdictions and/or that various withholding requirements apply to us or our subsidiaries or assert that benefits of tax treaties are not available to us or our subsidiaries, any of which could materially affect our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods for which such determination is made.
In addition, tax benefits we currently receive in certain jurisdictions require us to meet several conditions and may be challenged, terminated or reduced in the future, which would increase our taxes, possibly with a retroactive effect.
Furthermore, companies in the electronic payments industry, including us, may become subject to incremental taxation in various tax jurisdictions. The cost to comply with such laws or regulations could be significant. Taxing jurisdictions have not yet adopted uniform positions on this topic. We could be required to collect additional sales, use, value added, digital services, equalization levy or other similar taxes, either direct or indirect, or be subject to other liabilities that may increase the costs our customers would have to pay for our products and services and materially adversely affect our results of operations. If we are required to be responsible for payment of such additional taxes and are unable to pass such taxes or expenses through or collect them from our customers, our costs would increase, and our net income (loss) may be materially reduced.
In addition, the failure by our customers to comply with reporting obligations in connection with transactions on our platform could result in regulatory inquiry, reputational damage and potential enforcement actions and additional reporting and withholding requirements.
We are subject to risks relating to our Working Capital products, including collection risk, regulatory risk, and risks associated with the availability of capital for our Working Capital products.
The Working Capital products we provide are generally in the form of “merchant capital advances,” (i.e., purchase of future unsecured receivables from our customers). There is no economic recourse available to us in the event that the future receivables are not generated. Adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions or performance of our customers’ business could cause some of our customers who utilize our Working Capital products to cease operating or to experience a decline in their payment receipts, thereby rendering the receivables lower than the amount advanced and/or causing the repayment period to be extended beyond the original settlement term. With a merchant capital advance, the speed of settlement determines our effective yield, so any extension of settlement periods would be expected to reduce the effective yield we receive on such product. Further, we devote resources to collecting, and from time to time are unable to recover, some purchased receivables, which may have a material adverse effect on our results. In addition, adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions could lead to a decrease in the number of our customers who are eligible for our Working Capital products.
Merchant capital advances are subject to limited regulatory scrutiny in most jurisdictions, but some regulatory bodies may take a view that merchant capital advances should be subject to licensing requirements. Under such circumstances, or if the terms upon which we are able to offer merchant capital advances were required to be changed in order to comply with any requirements imposed by a regulatory body, we may need to pursue changes to the current model or pursue an alternative model for providing our Working Capital products. Substantial changes of the model may lead to a loss or modification of our financing facilities and as a result, this portion of our business may be materially adversely affected.
We currently fund our Working Capital product offering through balance sheet cash, and are subject to risks associated with the availability of capital for our Working Capital products.
We may not be able to secure financing on favorable terms, or at all, to meet our future capital needs, and any future indebtedness may restrict our operations, which could adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our business and to manage our operations. 
We fund our operations primarily through cash from operations. While we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to meet our working capital needs and planned capital expenditures, there is no guarantee that this will continue to be true in the future. In the future, we may require additional capital to respond to business opportunities or other unforeseen circumstances and may decide to engage in equity, equity-linked, or debt financings or enter into credit facilities. We may not be able to secure any such additional financing on favorable terms, in a timely manner, or at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on 
27

Table of Contents
terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited. 
We and our subsidiaries have in the past, and may in the future, incur substantial indebtedness. Agreements evidencing or governing any future indebtedness may contain financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries. If we are unable to service any debt and other obligations from cash flows, we may need to refinance or restructure all or a portion of such obligations prior to maturity. Our ability to refinance or restructure any debt and other obligations will depend upon the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time, including interest rates, which could increase the cost of refinancing debt and incurring new debt. Any refinancing or restructuring may also require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. If our cash flows are insufficient to service any debt and other obligations, we may not be able to refinance or restructure any of these obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all and any refinancing or restructuring could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.
We are dependent upon buyers’ and merchants’ continued and unimpeded access to the internet, and upon their willingness to use the internet for commerce.
Our success depends upon the general public’s ability to access the internet and its continued willingness to use the internet as a means to pay for purchases, communicate, research and conduct commercial transactions, including through mobile devices. Our third-party providers are also dependent on access to the internet. The adoption of any laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the internet, including changes to laws or regulations impacting internet neutrality, could decrease the demand for our products and services, increase our operating costs, or otherwise materially adversely affect our business. Given uncertainty around these rules, we could experience discriminatory or anticompetitive practices that could impede both our and our merchants’ growth, increase our costs or materially adversely affect our business. If buyers or merchants become unable, unwilling or less willing to use the internet for commerce for any reason, including lack of access to high-speed communications equipment, congestion of traffic on the internet, internet outages or delays, disruptions or other damage to buyers’ or merchants’ computers, increases in the cost of accessing the internet and security and privacy risks or the perception of such risks, our business could be materially adversely affected. 
Regulatory Risks Related to Payoneer
Our business is subject to laws, rules, regulations, policies and legal interpretations in the markets in which we operate, including (but not limited to) those governing cross-border and domestic money transmission, foreign exchange, privacy, data protection, deposit taking, factoring, stored value and payment services (including payment processing and settlement services). The legal and regulatory requirements applicable to us are extensive, complex, frequently changing, and increasing in number, and may impose overlapping and/or conflicting requirements or obligations in a variety of jurisdictions. Failure to comply could subject us to significant fines and other material adverse consequences.
Financial and political events have increased the level of regulatory scrutiny on the payments industry, and regulatory bodies may view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past and in a manner adverse to our business. Our success and increased visibility may result in increased regulatory oversight and tighter enforcement of rules and regulations that may apply to our business. Governments and regulators may impose new regulatory requirements in a range of areas that, among other things, may:
●
prohibit, restrict, and/or impose taxes or fees on our services, including to or from certain countries or with certain individuals, and entities;
●
impose additional customer identification and due diligence requirements;
●
impose additional reporting or record keeping requirements, or require enhanced transaction monitoring;
●
limit or restrict the types of entities capable of providing money transmission services, or impose additional licensing or registration requirements;
●
impose minimum capital or other financial requirements;
●
limit or restrict the revenue that may be generated from transmitting money, processing payments, or factoring receivables, including interest earned on customer funds, transaction fees, and revenue generated from foreign exchange transactions;

Table of Contents
●
require enhanced disclosures to customers;
●
limit the number or principal amount of money transmission transactions that may be sent to or from a jurisdiction, whether by an individual or in the aggregate; and
●
restrict or limit the ability of firms to process transactions using a centralized record keeping system located outside of the jurisdiction in which the customer is located, requiring that data associated be localized in the same jurisdiction as the customer.
Any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws and regulations (including changes to or expansion of the interpretation of those laws and regulations), including those discussed in this risk factor, may subject us to significant fines, penalties, criminal and civil lawsuits, forfeiture of significant assets, and other enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions; result in additional compliance and licensure requirements; increase regulatory scrutiny of our business; restrict our operations; result in the loss of banking relationships; force us to change our business practices, make product or operational changes or delay planned product launches or improvements. The foregoing could, individually or in the aggregate, expose us to significant liability, impose significant costs, require us to expend substantial resources, increase the cost and complexity of compliance, damage our brand and business, harm our reputation, make our products and services less attractive, result in the loss of customers, limit our ability to grow the business, and materially adversely affect our results of operations. The complexity of existing U.S. federal and state and foreign regulatory and enforcement regimes, coupled with the global scope of our operations and the evolving U.S. and international regulatory environment, has in the past and may in the future result in a single event giving rise to a large number of overlapping investigations and legal and regulatory proceedings and enforcement actions by multiple government authorities in different jurisdictions. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws, and regulations, but there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations.
We have obtained licenses to operate in multiple jurisdictions around the world. We hold licenses in the United States, Europe, the United Kingdom, Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, and Singapore. From time to time, we interact with our regulators concerning the interpretation or application of certain regulatory requirements. In addition, we are obligated to self-report when we exceed the parameters or constraints of our licenses. In the past, these matters have not had a material adverse effect on our business, but no assurance can be given that future disagreements or disputes will not have a material adverse effect on our business.
In the United States, we provide our services through Payoneer Inc. Payoneer Inc. is licensed as a money transmitter (or its equivalent) in all states where such license is required for our business, as well as in the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. As a licensed money transmitter, Payoneer Inc. is subject to restrictions with respect to its investment of customer funds, reporting requirements, bonding requirements and inspection by state regulatory agencies. Accordingly, if Payoneer Inc. violates these laws or regulations, we could be subject to liability and/or additional restrictions, forced to cease doing business with residents of certain states, forced to change our business practices or be required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals that could impose substantial costs.
We provide our services to customers in the EEA through our Irish subsidiary, Payoneer Europe Limited (“Payoneer Europe”). Payoneer Europe is licensed by the Central Bank of Ireland as an Electronic Money Institution and its license is “passported” across all EEA countries. Payoneer Europe is subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the disclosure, reporting, anti-money-laundering, capitalization, funds management, corporate governance, privacy, data protection, information security, taxation, sanctions, or other requirements imposed on Irish e-money institutions. The regulators in any country in which we provide services could seek to persuade the regulators that have granted us a license to require us to operate through a local branch. In addition, EU laws and regulations are typically subject to different and potentially inconsistent interpretations by the countries that are members of the EU. Such actions can make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage.
In the United Kingdom, Payoneer Payment Services (UK) Ltd. (“Payoneer United Kingdom”) is licensed by the Financial Conduct Authority as an Electronic Money Institution. In Japan, Payoneer Japan Ltd. (“Payoneer Japan”) is licensed as a Registered Fund Transfer Service Provider. In Australia, Payoneer Australia Pty. Ltd. (“Payoneer Australia”) is licensed by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission as a provider of a non-cash payment products. In Hong Kong, Payoneer Hong Kong Limited (“Payoneer Hong Kong”) is licensed as a Money Service Operator. In Singapore, Payoneer Singapore Pte Ltd (“Payoneer Singapore”) is licensed as a Major Payment Institution License by the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Accordingly, these entities are subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if any of the entities violate the product disclosure, reporting, anti-money laundering, capitalization, privacy, corporate governance or other requirements imposed by their respective regulators.

In India, we are registered as an Online Payment Gateway Service Provider, approved by the Reserve Bank of India, for the purpose of facilitating certain import and export payments for Indian residents. 
In China, we have been working to obtain a local license through an acquisition of a local licensed entity, and have received the regulatory approvals in China required to complete the transaction, which is expected to close in the first half of 2025, subject to customary closing conditions, as more fully described under “Risk Factors – Regulatory Risks Related to Payoneer - As a significant portion of our revenue is generated from China, any negative impact to our ability to serve customers based in China could materially adversely affect our results and exacerbate the other risks set forth herein.” 
In many of the markets in which we do business, we serve our customers through a company licensed in a different jurisdiction. It is unclear and uncertain whether our services are subject to regulatory oversight only in the jurisdictions in which they are licensed or if our services are subject to the laws of the jurisdiction in which our customer is based. We have been and expect to continue to be required to apply for various licenses, certifications and regulatory approvals in countries other than ones in which we have already obtained a license. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such licenses in the future, and the failure to obtain such licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we can obtain such licenses, there are substantial costs and potential product changes involved in maintaining such licenses, and we could be subject to fines or other enforcement action if we are found to violate disclosure, reporting, anti-money laundering, capitalization, corporate governance or other requirements.
In many countries it may not be clear whether we are required to be licensed as a payment services provider, financial institution or otherwise. In such markets, we may rely on local banks or licensed payment service providers to process payments and conduct foreign exchange transactions in local currency. Local regulators may use their power to slow or halt payments to our customers in those jurisdictions. Such regulatory actions or the need to obtain licenses, certifications or other regulatory approvals could impose substantial costs and involve considerable delay in the provision or development of our services in a given market, or require significant and costly operational changes, or prevent us from providing any services in a given market.
As we expand and localize our international activities, we are increasingly becoming obligated to comply with the laws of the countries or markets in which we operate. In addition, because our services are accessible worldwide and we facilitate sales of goods and services and provide services to customers worldwide, one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our customers are required to comply with their laws. Any of the foregoing may result in additional costs and regulatory scrutiny, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.
Failure to comply with anti-money laundering, anti-bribery, economic and trade sanctions regulations and similar laws, could subject us to penalties and other material adverse consequences.
We are subject to various anti-money laundering, anti-bribery, economic and trade sanctions regulations and similar laws, and our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to penalties and other material adverse consequences.
U.S. and other regulators globally continue to increase their scrutiny of compliance with these obligations, which requires us to continually monitor and update our compliance program, including the procedures we use to verify the identity of our customers and to monitor international and domestic transactions. Many countries in which we operate also have anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations, and we have been and continue to be required to make changes to our compliance program in various jurisdictions in response. The European Commission, for example, from time to time introduces revisions to the Anti-Money Laundering Directives, which make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage. Regulators regularly re-examine the transaction volume thresholds at which we must obtain and keep applicable records or verify identities of customers and any change in such thresholds could result in greater costs for compliance. 
We rely on technical programs and third-party providers to monitor our compliance with the laws and regulations to which we are subject. Such technical programs require us to timely update the programs to account for any relevant changes in laws or regulations. If we fail to update the technical programs correctly or in a timely manner, the technical programs may fail to flag conduct that violates existing laws or regulations, which may subject us to government investigation, fines or reputational damage and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
We routinely report to the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) on payments we have rejected or blocked pursuant to OFAC sanctions regulations and on any possible violations of those regulations. Any transactions we process in violation of OFAC sanctions regulations could result in claims or actions against us including litigation, injunctions, damage awards, fines or penalties, or require us to change our business practices that could result in a material loss, require significant

management time, result in the loss of banking relationships, result in the diversion of significant operational resources or otherwise materially harm our business. Violation of OFAC sanctions regulations that OFAC determines to be egregious can result in significant statutory penalties in addition to harm to our reputation. We have made in the past, and may make in the future, disclosures related to potential violations of OFAC sanctions regulations, and have been required to respond to inquiries from OFAC. For example, in February 2016, we submitted a disclosure to OFAC about certain payments to the Crimea region of Ukraine and other OFAC target countries, and subsequently entered into settlements relating to the foregoing matter which included monetary settlements. 
We may provide services to customers in foreign countries where companies often engage in business practices that are prohibited by United States and other regulations applicable to us. We are subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other laws that prohibit the making or offering of improper payments to foreign government officials and political figures, including anti-bribery provisions enforced by the Department of Justice. These laws prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by United States persons or companies for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have implemented policies, procedures, systems, and controls designed to identify and address potentially impermissible transactions under such laws and regulations; however, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, consultants and agents, including those that may be based in or from countries where practices that violate U.S. or other laws may be customary, will not take actions in violation of our policies, for which we may be ultimately responsible.
As a significant portion of our revenue is generated from China, any negative impact to our ability to serve customers based in China could materially adversely affect our results and exacerbate the other risks set forth herein.
Our services to customers from Greater China generated approximately 35% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024. This geographic concentration in our business creates exposure to local economic and political conditions and regulatory changes. We are vulnerable to economic downturns or changing political landscapes in China, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Taiwan, and the effects of potential trade wars involving such region. Any unforeseen events or circumstances that negatively affect these areas could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.
We currently support customers based in China through our partnerships with banks and licensed payment providers that are regulated by the People’s Republic of China and are licensed by the People’s Bank of China (the “PBOC”) and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE). We do not currently hold a license to operate in China, but recent Chinese legislation and PBOC requirements may require foreign companies that provide certain services to Chinese customers to have a local license and accordingly we have been working to obtain a local license through an acquisition of a local licensed entity. In February 2025 we received the regulatory approvals in China required to complete the acquisition, and its closing is expected in the first half of 2025 subject to customary closing conditions. Failure to acquire such a license in accordance with Chinese legislation and at such time as the PBOC may require foreign companies, including Payoneer, to have such a license could have a material adverse effect on our business. Once we obtain such license, there are substantial costs and potential product changes involved in maintaining such license, and we could be subject to fines or other enforcement action if we are found to violate disclosure, reporting, anti-money laundering, capitalization, corporate governance or other requirements imposed by the regulator. Any change in regulation or legal requirements in China that restricts the services we can provide to customers operating in China may lead to a decrease in revenue and materially adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition.
Our business is subject to complex and evolving regulations and oversight, in relation to privacy and data protection. Failure to comply with applicable data protection laws and regulations could subject us to fines and reputational harm and could materially adversely affect our results of operations. 
As part of our business, we process PII, also referred to under certain regulations as personal data or personal information, and other potentially sensitive data from our employees, customers, the vendors we work with and others. Laws and regulations in the United States, Europe and around the world restrict how personal information is collected, processed, stored, transferred, used and disclosed, as well as set standards for its security, implement notice requirements regarding privacy practices, and provide individuals with certain rights regarding the use, disclosure and sale of their protected personal information. Several foreign jurisdictions, including the EEA member states and the United Kingdom, have laws and regulations which are more restrictive in certain respects than those in the United States. For example, the GDPR implemented stringent operational requirements for the processing of personal data. In addition, the European e-Privacy Directive requires EEA member states to regulate marketing by electronic means and the use of web cookies and other tracking technologies. Each EEA member state has transposed the requirements of this directive into its own national data privacy regime, and therefore the laws may differ between jurisdictions. This directive has been undergoing reform for 
31

Table of Contents
the last few years and is expected to be replaced in the future by a regulation which should provide consistent requirements across the EU.
The GDPR and the UK GDPR introduced more stringent requirements (which are and will continue to be interpreted through guidance and decisions over the coming years) on organizations to allow access, erase or rectify an individual’s information upon request, implement mandatory data breach notifications and applies obligations on service providers and strict protections on how data may be transferred outside of the EEA or the UK (as relevant). Legal developments in Europe in recent years have created complexity and uncertainty regarding transfers of personal data from the EEA to the United States, which ultimately led to the European Commission’s July 2023 adequacy decision for the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, which was designed to address concerns previously raised by the Court of Justice of the European Union in relation to trans-Atlantic data flows between the EEA and the United States, however such decision is expected to be challenged in the future and the outcome of such potential challenges may again impact such data flows.
In the United States, both the federal and various state governments have adopted or are considering, laws, guidelines or rules for the collection, distribution, use and storage of information collected from or about consumers or their devices, including the State of California which enacted the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) in 2023, which requires disclosures to California consumers, imposes rules for collecting or using information about minors, and affords consumers abilities to opt out of certain disclosures of personal information. The CPRA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation in the future.  
In addition, the Personal Information Protection Law of the People’s Republic of China (PIPL) became effective in 2021. The PIPL regulates data processing in China, and the protection of the privacy and personal information of Chinese citizens. The PIPL applies to Chinese organizations, as well as foreign organizations engaging with customers from China, and requires such organizations to take necessary measures, as applicable, in order to ensure compliance.
As these and other laws and regulations may continue to evolve and be enacted, or new interpretation of existing laws and regulations apply, it may require us to modify our data processing practices, agreements and policies and to incur substantial costs in order to comply with this ever-evolving regulatory landscape. Restrictions on the collection, use, sharing or disclosure of PII or additional requirements and liability for security and data integrity could require us to modify our solutions and features, possibly in a material manner, could limit our ability to develop new services and features and could subject us to increased compliance obligations and regulatory scrutiny. We take a variety of technical and organizational security measures and other measures to protect the data we process, including data pertaining to our customers, employees and business partners. Despite measures we put in place, we may be unable to anticipate or prevent unauthorized access to such data, as described elsewhere in this Risk Factors section.
Non-compliance with data protection and privacy requirements may result in regulatory fines (which for certain breaches of the GDPR are up to the greater of 20 million Euros or 4% of total global annual turnover), regulatory investigations, reputational damage, orders to cease/change our processing of our data, enforcement notices, and/or assessment notices (for a compulsory audit). We may also face civil claims including representative actions and other class action type litigation (where individuals have suffered harm), potentially amounting to significant compensation or damages liabilities, as well as associated costs, diversion of internal resources, and reputational harm. Any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
General Risks Related to Payoneer
We may be subject to various legal proceedings which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
We are involved in various litigation matters from time to time. Such matters can be time-consuming, divert management’s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. Our insurance or indemnities may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us, and any claims asserted against us, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, may harm our reputation. If we are unsuccessful in our defense in these litigation matters, or any other legal proceeding, we may be forced to pay damages or fines, enter into consent decrees or change our business practices, any of which could be material and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

The failure to attract and retain key personnel could materially harm our overall business and results of operations.
We depend on the experience, skill and contributions of our senior management and other key employees. If we fail to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified management and key personnel, including (but not limited to), technical, compliance and sales employees, particularly in light of the intensified and expanded competition for talent, our future success could be harmed. Our senior management provides strategic direction for our company, and if we lose members of our leadership team, our management resources may have to be diverted from other priorities to address this loss. Our products and services require sophisticated knowledge of the financial services industry, applicable regulatory and industry requirements, computer systems, and software applications, and if we cannot hire or retain the necessary skilled personnel, we could suffer delays in new product development, experience difficulty complying with applicable requirements or otherwise fail to satisfy our customers’ demands. 
Acquisitions, joint ventures or other strategic transactions create certain risks and may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
We regularly evaluate potential strategic transactions such as acquisitions, investments, joint ventures, partnerships, dispositions, and strategic alternatives as part of our strategy. We may not be successful in identifying targets or assessing opportunities and we may incur significant costs, and management’s attention may be diverted, as we consider such transactions. Additional risks may arise from a number of reasons, including: we may need to borrow money or sell equity or debt securities to the public to finance a transaction and the terms of these financings may be adverse to us; changes in accounting, tax, securities or other regulations could increase the difficulty or cost for us to complete a transaction; we may incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities in connection with a transaction; and we could enter markets where we have minimal prior experience. Further, in the event that we consummate a transaction, we may not realize the anticipated benefits, which may materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. The operational integration of acquisitions, which may include systems, processes, and personnel, presents various risks that could potentially hinder our strategic execution, disrupt our business and divert our resources.
In addition, transactions outside of the United States often involve additional or increased risks including, for example: managing geographically separated organizations, systems and facilities; integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds and organizational cultures; complying with non-U.S. regulatory requirements; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; enforcement and protection of intellectual property in some non-U.S. countries; difficulty entering new non-U.S. markets due to, among other things, consumer acceptance and business knowledge of these new markets; and general economic and political conditions. 
We cannot ensure that any acquisition, investment, partnership, joint venture, disposition, or other strategic transaction we make will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
If we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, we may be unable to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations, which may materially adversely affect our business.
As a public company, we have significant requirements for enhanced financial reporting and internal controls, and must maintain internal controls over financial reporting to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The process of designing, implementing and maintaining effective internal controls is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business and the economic and regulatory environments. In this regard, we continue to dedicate internal resources, engage outside consultants, implement a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, take steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing whether such controls are functioning as documented, and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to maintain appropriate disclosure controls or internal controls and procedures over financial reporting, it could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations on a timely basis, result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements and materially adversely affect our operating results.
Climate change and environmental issues could materially adversely affect our operations, business, customers and partners.
Concerns over the risks associated with climate change and environmental matters have been growing in recent years, and are at the center of rapidly evolving rule-making in the United States and abroad. Customers, investors, partners, and other stakeholders have been focused on environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) practices. While, to date, we have not identified a material impact on our results and operations, we acknowledge that physical events, such as extreme weather and natural disasters, could disrupt our operations or those of our customers, partners, or third parties on which we rely, and may result in market volatility, shift in customer purchasing behaviors and travel patterns, and materially adversely impact our business. In addition, current and emerging ESG-related 
33

regulations in various jurisdictions, such as mandated reporting or requirements to reduce carbon footprint, may result in increased compliance requirements, which may increase our costs. 
Risks Related to Our Common Stock
The trading market for our common stock may be volatile, and the market price and trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate materially.
The trading price of our common stock has been, and will likely continue to be volatile and subject to wide price fluctuations, and the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant variation to occur, in response to various factors, including:
●
market conditions in the broader stock market in general, or in our industry in particular;
●
actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial and operating results;
●
accuracy of our earnings guidance or other forward-looking statements regarding our financial performance;
●
introduction of new products and services by us or our competitors;
●
issuance of new or changed securities analysts’ reports or recommendations;
●
sales of large blocks of our stock;
●
actions of activist shareholders;
●
additions or departures of key personnel;
●
regulatory developments;
●
litigation and governmental investigations; and
●
geopolitical and other economic and political conditions or events
 (such as potential global trade wars, tariffs, the war in Ukraine and Israel’s ongoing conflicts in the Middle East).
These and other factors may cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate materially, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock, or your ability to resell your shares at or above the purchase price. In addition, in the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. If any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit. Such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management from our business. Furthermore, we may in the future be the target of an activist campaign and responding to these types of actions by activist shareholders could be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management and our employees. Such activities could also interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plan.
The scope and contents of reports published by investment analysts, including short reports or any projections in those reports that differ from our actual results, could materially adversely affect the price and trading of our common stock.
The trading market for our securities depends in part on the research and reports that analysts publish about our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our common stock would likely decline. If few analysts cover us, demand for our common stock could decrease and our common stock price and trading volume may decline. Similar results may occur if one or more of these analysts stop covering us in the future or fail to publish reports on us regularly. In addition, securities research analysts may establish and publish their own periodic projections for us. These projections may vary widely and may not accurately predict the results we actually achieve. Our share price may decline if our actual results do not match the projections of these securities research analysts. 
34

Table of Contents
If a substantial number of shares become available for sale and are sold in a short period of time, the market price of our common stock could materially decline.
If our existing stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly. The perception in the public market that our existing stockholders might sell shares of common stock could also depress our market price. A decline in the price of shares of our common stock might impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities.
Anti-takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control, limit the price investors may be willing to pay in the future for our common stock and could entrench management.
Provisions within our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (our “certificate of incorporation”) and amended and restated bylaws (or “bylaws”) may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable by permitting our Board of Directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock, requiring advance notice for stockholder proposals and nominations and placing limitations on convening stockholder meetings. Further, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws currently include provisions creating a classified board of directors whose members serve staggered three-year terms. These provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control, which could materially harm our stock price. 
Additionally, our certificate of incorporation contains provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. These provisions include the ability of our Board of Directors to (i) prevent the transfer of capital stock, or the exercise of rights with respect to our capital stock, under certain circumstances, including if the effect of such transfer or exercise of rights would result in a stockholder holding more than 9.9% of the total outstanding shares of our capital stock on a fully diluted basis, and (ii) designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred shares, which may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities. These defenses could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of the Company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take corporate actions other than those you desire.
Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for certain stockholder disputes, subject to limited exceptions, which could discourage stockholder lawsuits or limit our stockholders’ ability to bring a claim in any judicial forum that they find favorable for disputes against our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders.
Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction thereof, the federal district court of the State of Delaware) will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the exclusive forum for any stockholder to bring (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer, other employee or stockholder of ours to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”), the certificate of incorporation or the bylaws (as either may be amended or restated) or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the law of the State of Delaware. The federal district courts of the United States shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the federal securities laws. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the forum provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws.
This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition.

Item 1C. Cybersecurity 
Cybersecurity Risk Management
Cybersecurity risk management is an integral part of Payoneer’s control infrastructure and is included as an overall risk in our enterprise risk management program.
 Payoneer’s cybersecurity risk management program is designed to align with industry best practices like National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) and Control Objectives for Information Technology (“COBIT”) which help provide a framework for handling cybersecurity threats and incidents, including threats and incidents associated with the use of applications developed and services provided by third-party service providers, and facilitate coordination across different departments of our company. 
This framework includes steps for assessing the severity of a cybersecurity threat, identifying the source of a cybersecurity threat including whether the cybersecurity threat is associated with a third-party service provider
, implementing cybersecurity countermeasures and mitigation strategies and informing management and our Risk Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Risk Committee”) of material cybersecurity threats and incidents. Our cybersecurity team is responsible for assessing our cybersecurity risk management program considering industry best practice and aligning to regulatory requirements and 
engages with third-party security
 experts for advisement on cybersecurity risk assessments and system enhancements. In addition, our cybersecurity team provides training to employees on a periodic basis.
Our Board of Directors has overall oversight responsibility for our risk management, and delegates cybersecurity risk management oversight to the 
Risk Committee
. The Risk Committee is responsible for reviewing our cybersecurity and the protection of data integrity policies and practices, including making recommendations for improvements in these areas. The Risk Committee oversees that management has processes in place designed to identify and evaluate cybersecurity risks to which the Company is exposed and implements processes and programs to manage cybersecurity risks and mitigate cybersecurity incidents. 
The Risk Committee also reports material cybersecurity risks to our Audit Committee, as the case may be, and material cybersecurity incidents would be reported to the full Board of Directors by management and/or the Risk Committee.

Management is responsible for identifying, considering and assessing material cybersecurity risks on an ongoing basis, establishing processes to ensure that such potential cybersecurity risk exposures are monitored and escalated appropriately, putting in place appropriate mitigation measures and maintaining cybersecurity programs.

Our cybersecurity programs are under the direction of our 
Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”)
