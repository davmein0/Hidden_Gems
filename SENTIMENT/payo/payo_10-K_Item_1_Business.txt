Overview
Payoneer is a financial technology company purpose-built to enable the world’s small and medium-sized businesses (“SMB(s)”) to grow and operate their businesses around the world by reliably and securely connecting them to the global digital economy. Payoneer’s financial stack makes it easier for millions of SMBs and entrepreneurs, particularly in emerging markets, to access global demand and supply, pay and get paid, and manage their cross border and other needs from a single platform. Our financial stack provides a suite of cross-border accounts receivable (AR) and accounts payable (AP) capabilities, including multicurrency account capabilities, and includes services such as working capital and funds management. Payoneer’s core value proposition is that we remove the complexity and barriers of doing business across borders for our customers. With a multi-currency Payoneer Account, businesses and entrepreneurs around the world can serve and transact with their overseas customers, suppliers, vendors, and contractors, and partners as if they were local. 
We primarily generate revenues when Payoneer customers use the funds in their Payoneer account to make a payment, make a purchase or to withdraw the funds to a financial institution. For our customers transacting on a B2B or DTC basis, we also in certain circumstances generate revenue when they receive funds, such as when they invoice a customer or collect payments via their webstore. Additionally, given the significant customer funds held on our platform and ongoing growth in those balances, and in light of the high interest rate environment in the U.S. and elsewhere, interest earned on customer funds held on our platform has been a significant source of revenue. Our long-term strategy is centered on growing the number of customers on our platform who fit our ideal customer profile, namely – those who are customers that have on average over $500 a month in volume and were active over the trailing twelve-month period, and on increasing the revenue we earn from each customer. We believe that successful execution of this strategy will drive revenue growth as (i) adding new customers who meet our ideal customer profile, improving retention, and increasing our product offerings to capture more wallet share will drive greater ad valorem volume of transactions processed through the Payoneer platform; and (ii) introducing new products and services and increasing customer adoption of additional products and services will improve our monetization of customers over time. Volume is one of the primary drivers for our revenue growth. See “Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for additional information. 
Our customers have trusted the Payoneer platform to process $80.1 billion, $66.0 billion, and $59.7 billion in volume during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. 
Looking forward, we intend to continue to invest actively to enhance our global platform, deliver new products, extend our regulatory footprint, further automate our operations, increase new customer growth and make acquisitions to accelerate our ability to deliver more value to customers around the world.

Key Development and Trends
Impact of Israel’s Conflicts in the Middle East
Since October 7, 2023, Israel has been at war with Hamas and Hezbollah, and exchanged attacks with Iran and other proxies of the regime. Despite the ongoing war, we have continued to operate our business and serve our customers around the world and, to date, our ability to support customers has not been materially impacted. We are monitoring the situation closely and benefit from our broad geographic footprint, partially outsourced operations model, and a robust business continuity plan. Additionally, our technology infrastructure has redundancy in place outside of Israel. Approximately 55% of our global employee base is located in Israel, including approximately 78% of our research and development resources. At this time, an insignificant portion of our Israeli workforce have been called to military reserve duty and we have contingencies in place to cover impacted roles and responsibilities.
The evolving conflict is likely to continue to impact economic activity in the region and could impact revenues from customers located in Israel. Our revenue derived from customers based in Israel was insignificant for the year ended December 31, 2024 and is included within revenues from Europe, Middle East, and Africa within Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The state of the ongoing conflict remains highly uncertain and could worsen or expand which could, in turn, further impact economic conditions in Israel and in the broader region. At this time, it is difficult to assess the impact the war may have on our future results of operations. Any further escalation, expansion, or prolonged continuation of the ongoing conflict has the potential to impact our operations as well as to negatively impact the broader global economy and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Impact of the War in Ukraine
During 2022, a geopolitical and armed conflict between Ukraine and Russia, which developed into an ongoing war, resulted in economic sanctions on Russia, Belarus, and certain territories in Ukraine. We provide services to customers in Ukraine and in jurisdictions that are or may be impacted by these economic sanctions. We have developed and implemented a robust transaction monitoring program designed to comply with imposed sanctions and to monitor the impact the conflict may have on our results of operations. During 2022, we ceased to provide services to customers in Russia and have limited our payment services to Belarus customers.  We have continued to provide services to customers located in Ukraine and our revenues in Ukraine have remained relatively stable. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, Ukraine and Belarus, combined, accounted for less than 10% of our revenue, of which Belarus accounted for less than 1% of our revenue, respectively. Further escalation of the conflict may have a material effect on our results of operations.
Macroeconomic Conditions 
Macroeconomic conditions, including geopolitical and other global events that impact consumer and business spending and behavior, such as, but not limited to, the interest rate environment, inflation, trade policies (including tariffs), local political instability, global health crises, supply chain dislocations, regional and other conflicts, including the ongoing war in Ukraine and Israel
’
s ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, and disruptions and instability and regulatory changes in the banking sector, as well as evolving changes to trade policies (including tariffs) particularly in the U.S, may impact our customers, providers, banking partners and relationships and ultimately the amount of volume processed on our platform which may affect our results of operations.
During 2023, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised the target benchmark interest rate by 525 basis points to a high of 525 to 550 basis points by August 2023. Coupled with continued growth in customer balances, this drove a significant increase in the interest income revenue we earn on our customer funds.  During 2024, the U.S. Federal Reserve cut the benchmark interest rate by 100 basis points to a target range of 425 to 450 basis points. While there remains uncertainty as to the timing and magnitude of future interest rate changes, we expect to see a negative impact on our revenue from declining interest rates over the medium-term. In response, as of the year ended December 31, 2024, we have invested a total of $1.8 billion of our customer funds in both available-for-sale debt securities and term deposits to reduce our sensitivity to declines in short term interest rates, and have purchased interest rate derivative contracts with respect to $1.9 billion in customer funds to provide a floor against the impact of interest rate declines below levels defined in the relevant interest rate derivative instruments.

Mergers & Acquisitions
On August 5, 2024, Payoneer acquired 100% of the outstanding equity of Skuad Pte. Ltd. (or 
“
Skuad
”
), a global workforce and payroll management company. The acquisition accelerates Payoneer
’
s strategy to deliver a comprehensive and integrated financial stack for SMBs that operate internationally.
In 2023, we entered into an agreement to acquire a licensed China-based payment service provider to support Payoneer
’
s China business. In February 2025, we received the regulatory approvals in China required to complete the acquisition, which is expected to close in the first half of 2025, subject to customary closing conditions and termination provisions provided for in the agreement. For more information on this pending acquisition, see Note 19 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Seasonality
Given the diverse nature of our customers and their businesses, Payoneer’s revenues experience seasonal fluctuations as a result of consumer and business spending patterns. Historically, we have seen revenues increase in the fourth quarter of every year, primarily as a result of higher e-commerce sales during the holiday season.
Key Factors Affecting Our Performance 
Continued Growth of Digital Commerce.
 We have continued to see growth in digital commerce, as businesses of all sizes increasingly look to access the global digital economy and as the market for goods, labor, and services becomes more global and more distributed. In 2022 and 2023, we saw e-commerce growth rates normalizing to pre-pandemic levels due to a combination of macroeconomic factors, including supply chain disruptions, inflation and higher interest rates, and consumers shifting spending preferences from goods to services, including travel, following the loosening of pandemic restrictions. In 2024, we have seen e-commerce growth accelerate, as macroeconomic conditions and consumer sentiment have improved. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, total volume increased by 21%, 11% and 8% on a year-over-year basis, respectively.
Multiple Acquisition Channels Allow Us to Add Customers, Including Those That Meet Our Ideal Customer Profile.
 We operate a two-sided network, providing services to buyers and suppliers, businesses and contractors, marketplaces and marketplace sellers, and connecting them via a single platform. 
​
We benefit from a strong brand in the markets in which our customers operate, and especially in key e-commerce markets such as China. We continue to make investments both in our brand and in our go-to-market infrastructure, including in our local go-to-market teams. Our financial performance will depend in large part on our ability to continue to add customers, including customers who meet our ideal customer profile.  
​
We leverage our unique relationships with various marketplace platforms to cost-effectively acquire and serve new customers and look to add new marketplace relationships, which drives increased volumes on our platform and broadens our global reach.  
​
We enter from time to time into various agreements with marketplaces and e-commerce platforms. These agreements govern how we provide services to SMBs and individuals receiving payments from those marketplaces, or how we provide services to the marketplace directly, or a combination of both. Some agreements have exclusivity arrangements with a defined term length, and in a few instances, we compensate the marketplace with structured incentives tied to the overall economics of the relationship. These incentive structures can apply throughout the contract term or through only a portion of the term. While the revenues we generate directly from our marketplace relationships are not significant, material changes to the terms that govern these relationships or the termination of those relationships could materially impact our revenues, expenses, and earnings.  
We benefit from a local presence and significant expertise in the markets in which our customers operate. We collaborate with many partners around the world, including local logistics firms, accounting firms, marketing companies and others, and these serve as a valuable acquisition channel for our business. We also integrate our services into software platforms, including accounting software providers, and with banks and other local payment providers. These partnerships enable us to offer better service to our customers and to cost-effectively acquire new customers. Our ability to innovate and grow is dependent, in part, on our ability to maintain and grow our partnership base.

Expanding our Addressable Market and Driving Increased Adoption of our Financial Stack.
 SMBs doing business in the global economy have many of the same complex needs as larger enterprises but lack internal resources and are underserved by the legacy financial system. Our financial stack is designed to meet the end-to-end AR and AP needs of SMBs with cross-border business.  
​
We will continue to make significant investments in both existing and new products and services, including for those customers who operate B2B and direct-to-consumer models. We remain focused on increasing our penetration in these markets through new customer acquisition and from driving increased adoption of these and other services, such as our card product. 
​
As we meet more of the needs of our customers, we expect to grow the revenues we earn from customers and to drive improved retention. Our ability to continue to grow our revenues is dependent on our ability to continue to grow our customer base and to drive increased adoption of our B2B, Checkout, card products and other differentiated offerings.  
​
Macroeconomic Trends
. 
Our results are impacted by the relative strength of the overall global economy and its effect on business investment, unemployment, consumer spending behavior, and business and consumer demand. Our revenues are also impacted by the level of customer funds held on our platform and by the interest rate we are able to earn on those funds.  
​
Our customers are also impacted by the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, both the global environment and specific regional or local factors. For example, trade policy and higher tariffs (as recently threatened or imposed by certain countries, including the U.S.) may increase the costs of cross-border trade. 
​
M&A
. We believe there are additional opportunities to leverage our global platform, regulatory and compliance infrastructure, technology, brand and team to deliver additional value to more customers more quickly by supplementing our organic product development with targeted acquisitions that add new capabilities, regulatory infrastructure or geographic expansion.
​
Components of Results of Operations 
The period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations have been prepared using the historical periods included in our consolidated financial statements. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Revenue 
The majority of our revenues are generated from transaction fees, which vary based on the type of service the customer utilizes. Transaction fee revenue principally consists of revenue generated when customers use their funds, either to withdraw their funds from our platform to a local banking institution or to use the funds to make payments. We also in certain circumstances generate revenue when customers receive funds, such as when they invoice a customer or collect payments via their webstore or from other businesses. Some services, such as virtual commercial cards, typically generate higher transaction fees from a dollar of volume than if that same dollar was withdrawn to a customer’s bank account.  
​
We generate significant revenues from interest earned on customer funds held on our platform. To a lesser extent, we generate revenue through the collection of fees, such as fees charged when payments are made into a customer’s account, and bank transfer fees, which are fees charged when one of Payoneer’s enterprise customers uses Payoneer to send a payment directly into the bank account of a small business or individual that does not have an account on our platform. The majority of our revenue is recognized and collected upon the completion of the underlying transaction. In some cases, revenues are collected through intermediaries. For more information on our revenue recognition policies, see note 2s. of our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Transaction costs 
Transaction costs mainly consist of fees paid to the banks, processors and networks that process payments to and from the Payoneer platform, costs to acquire currencies, card supply costs, losses related to certain of our services, and expenses related to the outstanding balance associated with the Warehouse Facility (for which the scheduled revolving period is now expired as described in greater detail below under “— Liquidity and Capital Resources”). These costs are net of any rebate programs with banks and processors, such as volume rebates. Transaction costs are primarily driven by volume and number of transactions and generally increase as volume and number of transactions increase, while certain of our products and services, such as our commercial card or checkout product, certain billing services and increases in flows in certain markets drive higher transaction costs.
43

Table of Contents
We are exposed to potential transaction losses such as credit or debit collections losses, recalled payments, card negative balances and chargebacks and capital advance losses. These costs are included in transaction costs. We record an allowance for estimated losses arising from the above scenarios as well as doubtful capital advances. 
Other operating expenses 
Other operating expenses mainly include compensation for our employees and subcontractors, who support customer service calls, customer onboarding costs, banking infrastructure implementations, transaction monitoring and liquidity management as well as indirect costs incurred for fraud detection, compliance operations, regulatory services and maintenance costs related to our customer call center infrastructure. 
Research and development expenses 
Research and development expenses consist primarily of employee compensation and related costs, professional services and consulting expenses, and non-capitalized costs associated with the development of new technologies. Such non-capitalized costs are charged to the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) as incurred. 
Sales and marketing expenses 
Sales and marketing expenses consist of costs for business development, customer success, product launch costs, marketing and advertising costs, retention costs and certain customer acquisition costs and includes employee compensation and related costs.
General and administrative expenses 
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation, benefits and overhead expenses associated with corporate management. This also includes, among other things, directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, director fees, internal and external accounting and legal and administrative resources, including audit and legal fees. 
Depreciation and amortization 
Depreciation and amortization consist primarily of amortization of intangible assets, internally developed software, and depreciation of our investments in property, equipment, and software. We depreciate and amortize our assets on a straight-line basis in accordance with our accounting policies. 
Financial income (expense), net 
Financial income (expense), net includes gains (losses) from foreign exchange fluctuations. We conduct transactions worldwide and settle accounts with our financial intermediaries in various currencies. Interest income (expense) from corporate cash and cash equivalents deposited in our accounts is also included under financial income (expense), net, which vary based on cash and cash equivalents balances, and based on market rates. In addition, as a result of the reverse recapitalization transaction we completed with FTAC Olympus Acquisition Corp. (“FTOC”) in 2021, we assumed public warrants that were exercisable for shares of our common stock. These warrants were repurchased and redeemed in full in September 2024 (Refer to Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details), but prior to repurchase and redemption were classified as a liability and remeasured at period end and the corresponding mark-to-market adjustment were included in financial income (expense), net.
Income taxes 
We are in a taxable income position in the U.S. and in certain foreign jurisdictions, for which there are income taxes recorded. In addition, we record expenses associated with uncertain income tax positions.
Share in losses of associated company 
Investment in entities where we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee and investment in joint ventures, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. As of December 31, 2022, we had a joint venture with assets and operations located in China. In January 2023, through our subsidiary Payoneer Research and Development Ltd., we acquired all remaining interests in the joint venture from other partners, and in February 2025, formally deregistered the entity. For the periods prior to full ownership and consolidation, our share in the results of operations is included as share in losses of associated company on our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).

​
Year ended December 31, 2024 Compared to the year ended December 31, 2023
Revenues
Revenues were $977.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $146.6 million, or 18%, compared to $831.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This increase in revenue was generally in line with volume, which grew by $14.0 billion, or 21% compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in revenue was driven by an increase in SMB revenue, including $66.3 million from SMBs that sell on marketplaces, $47.0 million from B2B SMBs, and $13.7 million from SMBs selling DTC. This growth in SMB revenue was driven by continued adoption of our high value services, certain monetization initiatives, ongoing growth in high value regions, and growth in the number of customers on our platform. The remaining increase in revenues was driven by an increase of $26.2 million in interest income earned on customer balances resulting from modestly higher interest rates and an increase in customer balances held on our platform compared to the prior year period.
Transaction costs 
Transaction costs were $152.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $29.8 million, or 24%, compared to $122.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, largely as a result of the 21% increase in volume, as well as from an increase in chargebacks and other operational losses of $5.5 million. 
Other operating expenses 
Other operating expenses were $169.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $8.9 million, or 6%, compared to $160.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This increase was driven by an increase of $13.6 million in information technology expenses and an increase of $1.1 million in reserves related to ongoing regulatory matters, partially offset by a 
45

Table of Contents
decrease of $5.2 million in employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses primarily due to a decrease in employee headcount.
Research and development expenses 
Research and development expenses were $134.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $15.4 million, or 13%, compared to $119.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This increase was driven primarily by an increase of $19.5 million in employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses as a result of an increase in average employee headcount, a $2.1 million increase in information technology expenses, and a $1.7 million increase in third-party contractor expenses. This was partially offset by an increase of $9.2 million in the amount of payroll and third-party related costs capitalized as internal use software.
Sales and marketing expenses 
Sales and marketing expenses were 
$
211.8

million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of 
$
15.2 million, or 8
%
, compared to $196.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
This increase was driven mainly by an increase of $11.9 million in

expenditures on certain direct marketing efforts, an increase of $2.2 million in partnership commissions, and an increase of $1.2 million in information technology expenses. 
General and administrative expenses 
General and administrative expenses were $113.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $12.3 million, or 12%, compared to $100.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This increase was driven mainly by an increase of $4.5 million in M&A related expenses, an increase of $3.5 million in third-party consultancy expenses, and $1.8 million in expense related to the fair value adjustment of a liability related to our 2024 acquisition of Skuad.
Depreciation and amortization expenses 
Depreciation and amortization expenses were $47.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $19.5

million, or 70%, compared to $27.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was driven primarily by an increase in amortization of internal use software costs.
Financial income (expense), net 
Financial expense, net was $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, a change of $38.5 million compared to $28.9 million in income for the year ended December 31, 2023. The change was primarily driven by a $14.7 million loss from the warrant repurchase and redemption transaction in 2024, as well as a gain on revaluation of warrant liabilities (prior to repurchase and redemption) that was $14.6 million lower in the current year period compared to prior year, as well as a $9.9 million increase in loss on revaluation of foreign currency balances.
Income taxes
 Income tax expense was $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $20.9 million, or 53%, compared to $39.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by (i) a reduction in U.S. current tax expense of $3.1 million and a U.S. provision-to-return benefit of $11.8 million (specifically related to the 2023 tax return), both of which were related to a deduction claimed under U.S. tax law for income earned from foreign customers, and (ii) a reduction in foreign tax expense of $9.4 million for future deductions of certain share-based compensation expenses. These impacts were partially offset by additional expense for unrecognized tax benefits.
Net income  
For a discussion regarding our net income position in 2024 and 2023, please refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The following discussion of our liquidity and capital resources is based on the financial information derived from our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
46

Table of Contents
We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our operating working capital, share repurchase and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. Our future financing requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development of our platform and the ongoing expansion needs of sales and marketing activities. We have in the past and may in the future enter into agreements with third parties with respect to investments in, or acquisitions of, businesses or technologies, which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing.
Sources of Liquidity
As of December 31, 2024, we had $497.5

million of cash and cash equivalents.
On October 28, 2021, Payoneer Early Payments Inc. (“PEPI”), our wholly-owned second tier subsidiary and its subsidiary (the “Borrower”) entered into a multi-party Receivables Loan and Security Agreement (the “Warehouse Facility”) with, inter alia, affiliates of Viola Ventures. The objective was to provide access to external financing for our capital advance activity. See Note 14 and Note 26 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. As disclosed in Note 14 and Note 26, the Warehouse Facility reached its scheduled revolving period termination date on October 28, 2024, and the Company has repaid all outstanding borrowings. The Warehouse Facility is set to be automatically terminated on April 28, 2025. After the expiration of the Warehouse Facility, the Company intends to finance capital advance activity internally.
Current and Future Cash Requirements 
On May 7, 2023, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program that provides for the repurchase of up to $80.0 million of our common stock, including any applicable excise tax. On December 7, 2023, the Board of Directors authorized an amendment to the program to increase the authorized amount of repurchases to an aggregate amount not to exceed $250.0 million, including the amount that remained available as of December 7, 2023 to repurchase common stock under, but not any prior repurchases effected pursuant to, the previous authorization, and any applicable excise tax. The amended authorization expires on December 31, 2025.

Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities was $
176.9

million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $
17.4

million compared to $159.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
Impact of net income - $27.8 million year over year increase to operating cash flows
This increase was driven by an increase in net income of $27.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year period, which was primarily a result of $146.6 million of growth in revenue which outpaced $101.2 million of growth in operating expenses, as well as a $20.9 million reduction in tax expense, partially offset by a $38.5 million reduction of other financial income, as discussed in the Results of Operations section above.

Table of Contents
Impact of non-cash items - $35.7 million year over year increase to operating cash flows
The increase in net income period over period includes non-cash items, including higher non-cash addbacks to net income to arrive at operating cash flows compared to prior year, consisting primarily of:
●
$19.5 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense
●
$29.3 million related to Warrants, driven by  a decrease of $14.6 million in the amount of the gain recorded on Warrant revaluation and a $14.7 million loss on the Warrant repurchase and redemption transaction 
●
An increase of $7.9 million in the amount of the addback due to the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 
The overall increase to operating cash flows from non-cash items was partially offset by higher non-cash reductions to net income compared to prior years, consisting primarily of:
●
$11.5 million increase in deferred tax assets compared to the prior year period increase, primarily due to share-based compensation temporary differences in the current year period, which exceeded the release of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in the United States during the prior year
●
$8.6 million from interest not paid in cash and amortization of discount on investments in debt securities
Impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities - $46.1 million year over year decrease to operating cash flows
During the year ended December 31, 2024, cash flows related to Other current assets decreased $40.5 million, Other payables decreased $9.7 million, and Trade payables increased $9.5 million, in each case compared to the prior year period, all due to changes in timing of payments relative to period cut-off. Additionally, cash flows related to Other assets decreased $9.0 million from the prior period primarily related to $9.5 million of accrued interest on term deposits which we had not invested in the prior period.

Note that each of these drivers are net of acquired Skuad assets and liabilities.

Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $1,961.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $1,917.0 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of $44.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
This change was predominantly related to the net purchase of $1,166.8 million in investments in U.S. Treasury Securities and $600.0 million in term deposits, both related to customer balances held on our platform. In addition, our acquisition of Skuad represented a use of cash in the year, net of cash acquired, of $48.2 million. Also included in cash used in investing activities is $35.2 million related to derivative  instruments purchased and $12.9 million in incremental investment in internal use software when compared to the prior year. The change was also impacted by a cash inflow in the prior year of $6.0 million related to our acquisition of the remaining interest in a joint venture, which did not recur. Additionally, customer funds in-transit at period-end were $51.7 million lower than the prior year period.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $427.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $84.2 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $512.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This decrease was primarily driven by an incremental $82.1 million in cash used for common stock repurchases, $20.7 million in related party debt repayment, and $19.8 million related to the repurchase and redemption of our public warrants. These impacts were partially offset by the receipt of collateral on our derivative instruments of $18.8 million, an increase in customer balances held on our platform of $11.7 million, and $7.9 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to our stock-based compensation program.
Lease Commitments
We have entered into various non-cancelable leases for certain offices and vehicles with contractual lease periods expiring between 2025 and 2035.

Additionally, in 2024, we entered into a lease commencing after the balance sheet date, which is expected to necessitate lease payments of approximately $5.5 million annually for the first five years, and $5.0 million annually for five years thereafter, exclusive of fees and expenditures for construction and other related costs.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of the balance sheet dates of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by Regulation S-K, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to evaluate our business, analyze our performance, and make strategic decisions. We believe these metrics and non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as management. However, certain of these measures are not financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as substitutes for financial measures that have been calculated in accordance with GAAP. We primarily review the following key performance indicators and non-GAAP measures when assessing our performance: 
Volume 
Volume refers to the total dollar value of transactions successfully completed or enabled by our platform, not including orchestration transactions. For a customer that both receives and later sends payments, we count the volume only once. Volume serves as a key metric for overall business activity, as growing volume is one of the primary drivers for our revenue growth.

​
Volume grew 21% for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, driven by a combination of continued growth in volumes from SMBs selling on marketplaces, strong growth in volume from B2B SMBs, and continued strength in volumes processed for enterprise partners, including in the travel segment. 
Revenue
We generate revenues mainly from transaction fees, which vary based on the type of service the customer utilizes. Transaction fee revenue principally consists of fees for withdrawals and usage. We also earn revenues in certain instances from volumes coming into the platform related to our B2B services and through our Checkout offering. We generate significant revenues from interest earned on customer funds held on our platform. In addition, we generate revenue from non-volume-based products and services which are based on a fixed fee. We believe that Revenue demonstrates our ability to monetize volume activity on our platform. Our revenues can be impacted by the following:
(i)
Mix in customer size, products, and services;
​
(ii)
Mix between domestic and cross-border transactions;
​
(iii)
Geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs; and
​
(iv)
Pricing and other market conditions, including interest rates.
​
Management closely monitors volume and revenue to ensure that we continue to grow funds and business activity that enters into the platform, expanding our overall scale and the reach of our business.

Adjusted EBITDA
In addition to our financial results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe Adjusted EBITDA, as a non-GAAP measure, is useful in evaluating our operating performance. We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our business, results of operations or outlook. In particular, we believe that the use of Adjusted EBITDA is helpful to our investors as it is a metric used by management in assessing our operating performance. However, non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly-titled non-GAAP measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measure as a tool for comparison. A reconciliation is provided below for our non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measure and the reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.

Table of Contents
Critical Accounting Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the report amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and the assumptions used. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
We believe that the accounting estimates discussed in this section are critical based on the subjectivity and judgement involved in the underlying assumptions, and the materiality to our consolidated financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described within Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. 
Allowance for Capital advance (“CA”) losses: 
We have established an allowance for CA losses (“ALCAL”), which represents our estimate of current expected credit losses inherent in our portfolio. Since the adoption of ASC 326, Current Expected Credit Losses, as of January 1, 2022, we estimate ALCAL based on historical lifetime loss data as well as macroeconomic forecasts applied to the portfolio, which is segmented by program. Loss rates are generated using historical loss data for each portfolio which are applied to segments of each portfolio. We then apply macroeconomic factors such as market unemployment rate, current and forecasted GDP, S&P yield, risk free rate and inflation rate, which are sourced externally, using a single scenario that we believe is most appropriate to the economic conditions applicable to a particular period. Expected credit loss rates, incorporating historical loss data and macroeconomic factors, are applied to the principal amount of our CA receivables.
Determining appropriate current expected credit loss allowances for CA receivables is an inherently uncertain process and ultimate losses may vary from current estimates. We regularly update our allowance estimates as new facts become known, and events occur that may impact the settlement or recovery of losses. The allowances are maintained at a level we deem appropriate to adequately provide for current expected credit losses at the balance sheet date after incorporating the impact of externally sourced macroeconomic forecasts.
Goodwill:
The valuation of assets acquired in a business combination requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to estimate the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in an acquired business to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated or amortized and goodwill. Our estimates are based upon assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. These valuations require the use of management’s assumptions, which do not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment at the reporting unit level in the third quarter, or sooner when circumstances indicate an impairment may exist. The impairment evaluation for goodwill utilizes a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired. The qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, operating environment, financial performance and other relevant events, which are inherently subject to estimation. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, then we are required to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test, which requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow method. The discounted cash flow method, a form of the income approach, uses expected future operating results and a market participant discount rate. Estimation is inherent in calculating the discount rate to apply and involves the use of third-party specialists. 
Revenue recognition: 
Application of the accounting principles in U.S. GAAP related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates. Complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting. Specifically, the determination of whether we are a principal to a transaction (gross revenue) or an agent (net revenue) can require considerable judgment. Further, we provide incentive payments to customers, including marketplace platforms, and merchants, which require judgment to determine whether the payments should be recorded as a reduction to gross revenue. Changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact the amount of revenue recognized. 
51

Table of Contents
Income taxes:
Calculating our tax provision requires us to make estimates regarding the timing and amount of taxable and deductible items which will adjust pretax income earned in various tax jurisdictions. We are required to interpret complex tax legislation in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and although we believe that our estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable, actual results may be materially different than the estimated amounts.
The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when the likelihood of the deferred tax assets not being realized exceeds the more likely than not criterion. Assessing the likelihood of realizing deferred tax assets involves significant judgement and assumption. Management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. 
We follow the guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to estimate whether it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that the tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, based solely on the technical merits of the tax position; otherwise, no benefit can be recognized. The tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Additionally, we accrue interest and related penalties, if applicable, on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws. Interest and penalties are classified as taxes on income in the consolidated financial statements.
In addition to aforementioned changes, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 also included a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and as a result, all previously unremitted earnings for which no U.S. deferred tax liability had been accrued were subject to U.S. taxation. Notwithstanding the U.S. taxation of these amounts, we intend to continue to invest most or all of these earnings, as well as our capital in these subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. and do not expect to incur any significant, additional taxes related to such amounts.
Loss contingencies:
We are a party to certain legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters. We evaluate the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of all legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party and accrue a loss contingency when the loss is probable and reasonably estimable. These judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of its defenses and consultation with in-house and external legal counsel. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims, litigation, or other enforcements and may revise our estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may differ materially from the actual outcomes. 
Contingent consideration liability:
As described in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company recognized a liability related to contingent consideration in connection with the Skuad acquisition during the year ended 2024. 
The fair value of the contingent consideration at each reporting date is based on estimates of probability of each outcome and the Option Pricing Model (“OPM”). The OPM requires various assumptions and inputs, and our estimates of probability are subjective based on the status of Skuad’s performance and our expectations about future performance. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, the estimate of the contingent liability is based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability and may revise our estimates. 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
A description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position, result of operations or cash flows is disclosed in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks.
We have operations both within the United States and globally, and we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business, including the effects of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about these market risks is described below.
Interest Rate Sensitivity
The majority of our cash and cash equivalents and assets underlying customer funds were held in cash deposits and money market funds as of December 31, 2024, the fair value of which would not be materially affected by either an increase or decrease in interest rates, due mainly to the relatively short-term nature of these instruments. The fair value of our investments in term deposits and U.S. Treasury Securities, amounting to $1.8 billion, would be affected by changes in interest rates, and such changes could be material. 
The Company has entered into interest rate floor contracts with respect to $1.9 billion in customer funds to limit the potential risk declining interest rates would have on our revenues from interest income, though as of the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a hypothetical 1% increase or decrease in interest rates could have a material effect on our revenues and earnings.
Foreign Currency Risk
While most of our revenue is earned in U.S. dollars, our foreign currency exposure includes currencies of the countries in which our operations are located, including operating expenses denominated in New Israeli Shekels. To reduce that risk, in January 2024, we began investing in foreign currency forward contracts and net purchased options, which are accounted for as cash flow hedges as described in Note 2e and Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A hypothetical 10% strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar against the New Israeli Shekel would have had a material impact on unrealized gains (losses) recognized in AOCI at December 31, 2024.
Our foreign currency exposure also includes currencies in which our customer funds are held, or in which they are withdrawn or utilized, and may be subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro, British Pound, Japanese Yen, Chinese Yuan, Canadian Dollar, New Israeli Shekel, Philippine Peso, Indian Rupee, Mexican Peso, Pakistani Rupee, South Korean Won, Malaysian Ringgit, Saudi Riyal, Thai Baht, Turkish Lira, and Hong Kong Dollar. As of the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in current exchange rates could have a material impact on our financial results.
In addition, some of our services include the opportunity for Payoneer to generate revenues from foreign exchange transactions as part of the payment delivery process. Our ability to generate such revenues is partially dependent on external factors such as market conditions, applicable regulations and our ability to negotiate with third-party financial institutions. The impact of these efforts to optimize foreign exchange can be material to revenues and earnings.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
​
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Payoneer Global Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss), of changes in shareholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  
​
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
​
Basis for Opinions
​
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
​
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Table of Contents
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
​
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
​
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
​
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
​
Critical Audit Matters
​
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Accounting for Income Taxes
​
As described in Notes 2(aa) and 24 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded income taxes of $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, and has net deferred tax assets of $40.1 million, including a valuation allowance of $19.2 million, and liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $41.8 million as of December 31, 2024. The Company operates on a global basis and is subject to tax laws and regulations in the US as well as numerous foreign jurisdictions. Management measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which management expects to recover or settle the temporary differences. In assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowance is based on management’s estimates of future taxable income and application of relevant tax law. The estimate of the Company’s tax liabilities relating to uncertain tax positions requires management to assess uncertainties and to make judgments about the application of complex tax laws and regulations. As disclosed by management, the Company’s income tax filings are regularly under audit in multiple federal, state, and foreign jurisdictions and income tax audits may require an extended period of time to reach resolution and may result in significant income tax adjustments.
​
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to accounting for income taxes is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when determining the provision for income taxes, net deferred tax assets, including a valuation allowance, and liabilities for uncertain tax positions and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to these account balances and tax positions.
​
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to income taxes, including management’s controls over the establishment of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets, and the identification and recognition of the liability for uncertain tax positions. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing the provision for income taxes, including the effective tax rate reconciliation, return to provision adjustments, and permanent and temporary differences; (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in measuring and recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities; (iii) evaluating management’s assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets on a jurisdictional basis; (iv) evaluating the completeness of management’s assessment of the identification of uncertain tax positions, possible outcomes of each uncertain tax position based on the application of relevant tax laws, and the amount of the potential benefit to be realized, including estimated interest and penalties; and (v) evaluating the status and results of income tax audits with the relevant tax authorities.

NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a.
Principles of consolidation, basis of presentation, and accounting principles:
The accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) in the United States of America (hereafter – U.S. GAAP) and include the accounts of Payoneer Global Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in an entity where the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. For such investments, the Company’s share of the investee’s results of operations is shown within Share in losses of associated company on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) and its investment balance as an investment in associated company on the consolidated balance sheets.

U.S. DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS (EXCEPT SHARE DATA)
​
NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued):
b.
Use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements:
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, allowance for capital advance receivables, income taxes, goodwill, revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, contingent consideration associated with M&A, and loss contingencies. 
c.
Functional currency and translation:
The functional currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar (“dollar” or “$”). Where the Company’s foreign subsidiaries derive their revenue primarily from services provided to the parent company as well as obtain their financing from the parent company in dollars, the Company has determined the functional currencies to be the dollar as well.
Accordingly, monetary accounts maintained in currencies other than the dollar are re-measured into dollars in accordance with the principles set forth in ASC 830, 
Foreign Currency Translation
.
​
Balances in non-dollar currencies are translated into dollars using historical and current exchange rates for non-monetary and monetary balances, respectively. For non-dollar transactions reflected in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss), the transaction date exchange rates are used. The resulting transaction gains or losses are recorded as other financial income or expense. The Company recognized $
15,574
 of such transaction losses during the year ended December 31, 2024. Depreciation, amortization and other changes deriving from non-monetary items are based on historical exchange rates. 
Certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries acquired in the Skuad acquisition use the local currency of the respective country of domicile as their functional currencies. Assets and liabilities of these non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the period-end rate of exchange. Revenues, costs, and expenses of the non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using transaction date exchange rates. Gains and losses resulting from these translations are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) (“OCI”). Gains and losses from the remeasurement of foreign currency transactions into the functional currency are recognized as other financial income or expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).
d.
Fair value measurement:
The Company applies the provisions of ASC 820, 
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
 (“ASC 820”), regarding fair value measurements for assets and liabilities. ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions apply whenever other accounting pronouncements require or permit fair value measurements.
Fair value measurements used in the consolidated financial statements are based upon the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:
Level 1— Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
​
F-13

Table of Contents
PAYONEER GLOBAL INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
U.S. DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS (EXCEPT SHARE DATA)
​
NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued):
Level 2 — Valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3 — Unobservable inputs in which little or no market activity exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair values of the Company's cash, cash equivalents, customer funds (other than the portion consisting of available-for-sale debt securities), restricted cash, accounts receivable, capital advance receivables, accounts payable, and outstanding operating balances approximated the carrying values of these instruments presented in the Company's consolidated balance sheets because of their nature. As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of the Company’s long-term debt approximated the carrying value for the same reason. The fair value of long-term debt, when carrying value does not approximate fair value, is determined using Level 3 unobservable inputs and assumptions by the Company.
e.
Derivatives and Hedging:
The Company is exposed to foreign currency risk due to operating expenses denominated in New Israeli Shekels. To reduce that risk, the Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts and net purchased options to hedge foreign currency risk related to its foreign operations in Israel. Additionally, the Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its investments in floating rate cash equivalent instruments. To reduce that risk, the Company has purchased interest rate derivative instruments to mitigate interest rate risk on a portion of the revenues associated with these floating rate investments. The company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
The Company designates derivatives as hedges of forecasted transactions (“cash flow” hedges) or derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting. To qualify for hedge accounting treatment, a derivative must be highly effective in mitigating the designated risk of the hedged item. Effectiveness of the hedge is formally assessed at inception and throughout the life of the hedging relationship. The Company evaluates the effectiveness of derivative contracts on a quarterly basis by comparing the critical terms of the derivative instruments with the critical terms of the forecasted cash flows of the hedged item; if the critical terms are the same, the Company concludes the hedge will be perfectly effective. The Company does not exclude any component of the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. 
To the extent that derivatives qualify as cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value are recorded, net of applicable taxes, in OCI and subsequently reclassified into the same statement of comprehensive income (loss) line item as the hedged exposure when the underlying hedged item is recognized in earnings. Under an election to classify the cash flows from derivatives designated in a qualifying cash flow hedging relationship in the same category as the cash flows from the hedged items, the cash flows associated with derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are reported in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. 
Derivatives that are not designated hedges are adjusted to fair value into earnings through financial income or expense. The cash flows associated with these derivatives, if any, are reported in cash flows from investing activities.
Where the Company is party to master netting arrangements, as is the case for interest rate derivative instruments, it offsets the fair value of derivative assets, liabilities, and related collateral balances in its consolidated balance sheet. In the consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company treats cash payments and receipts on collateral as investing cash flows when the collateral account is in an asset position, and as financing cash flows when the collateral account is in a liability position.
The Company was required to pay a premium related to the interest rate derivative instruments discussed above – this premium is amortized using the caplet method over the life of the instrument and is recognized in the same statement of comprehensive income (loss) line item as the hedged exposure. Cash flows related to the premium are included in cash flows from investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued):
f.     Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash:
The Company considers cash invested in short-term bank deposits (up to three months from date of deposit) that are not restricted to withdrawal or use and money market instruments, to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalent balances with various institutions, which may include banks, payment service providers, or other financial institutions. The Company regularly reviews investment concentrations of these institutions and has relationships with a globally diversified group of service providers.
The Company defines restricted cash as cash held as collateral for the purpose of maintaining compliance with certain agreements, deposits held with payment processors and issuing banks that assist the Company in executing payment transactions, deposits in connection with regulatory requirements, deposits related to hedging activities, term deposits, proceeds from employee equity transactions to be remitted to employees, and deposits for property rental in different locations around the globe. The classification of restricted cash between current and non-current assets depends on the expected duration of the underlying activity.
g.
Customer funds and investments:
The Company holds all customer balances, inclusive of workforce management customer deposits, both in the U.S. and internationally, as direct claims against us which are reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as a liability classified as outstanding operating balances. Workforce management deposits are collected upon consummation of customer relationships and held to secure future customer payroll obligations and are released to customers upon termination. 
The Company does not commingle customer funds in accounts dedicated for holding corporate funds. In certain jurisdictions, the Company may be restricted as to the types of accounts in which customer funds may be maintained and as to the types of assets that may be held.
Customer funds include funds in transit that have not yet settled with the designated payee bank account or have yet to be loaded to a customer card or account. These funds are classified on the consolidated statements of cash flows as investing activities.
The Company maintains dedicated interest and non-interest bearing bank accounts for the holding of customer funds, and has invested certain funds underlying customer balances in available-for-sale debt securities and term deposits. The Company classifies the assets underlying the customer funds as current or non-current based on the maturity of the investment in which they are held. 
Investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value, net of any unamortized discount or premium, accrued interest, and unrealized gains and losses, within Customer funds on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized gains and losses are included as a component of OCI, net of related estimated tax provisions or benefits. Interest income, amortization of any discount or premium, and realized gains and losses on these securities are recognized within revenue from other sources on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). In the period of sale, any unrealized gain or loss previously recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) is reversed into net income. Purchases, maturities, and sales of debt securities are classified as investing activities and as such, are excluded from the basis of cash, cash equivalents, restricted deposits, and customer funds on the consolidated statements of cash flows.
The Company accounts for purchases and sales of securities on the trade date and recognizes any related cut-off asset or liability within Other current assets or Other payables, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets.

Investments in term deposits are accounted for as restricted cash, given that the Company’s ability to withdraw the balances is restricted during the term of the deposit agreement. $
4,150
 and $
9,493
 in accrued interest on term deposits was included in Other current assets and Other assets, respectively, as of December 31, 2024. Interest income is recognized within revenue from other sources on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss), and the balances are included within Customer funds on the consolidated balance sheets. Similar to investments in debt securities described above, purchases and maturities of term deposits are classified as investing activities and as such, are excluded from the basis of cash, cash equivalents, restricted deposits, and customer funds on the consolidated statements of cash flows.
h.
Accounts receivable, net:
The Company records receivables when services are transferred to customers in exchange for a right to receive consideration, conditional only upon the passage of time. The Company periodically assesses and evaluates the collectability of outstanding receivables and maintains an allowance for expected credit losses related to accounts receivable. 
i.
Capital advance (“CA”) receivables, net:
The Company enters into transactions with pre-qualified sellers in which the Company purchases a designated amount of future receivables for an upfront cash purchase price. The delivery of the future receivables purchased in exchange for the advance cash purchase price is facilitated through the seller’s payment processing activities with the Company. There is no economic recourse to the seller in the event that the future receivables are not generated. There is also no fixed period of time in which the seller must deliver the purchased future receivables to the Company, as delivery of the purchased future receivables is contingent on the sellers’ generation of such receivables. 
Although there is no economic recourse to the seller in the event that the future receivables are not generated, the degree of uncertainty related to this economic benefit is mitigated by the due diligence performed by the Company prior to purchasing the seller’s future receivables and is further mitigated by contractual remedies.
The Company’s due diligence includes, but is not limited to, detailed analysis of the seller’s historical processing volumes, transaction count, chargeback history, growth of the seller, and account longevity with the Company or marketplace.
The Company recognizes revenues associated with these fees over the CA period, adjusting the amount to reflect an effective interest rate. The fees earned on these receivables are included in revenue on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) and the total fees were not significant to the Company’s operations for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022.
CA receivables, net represents the aggregate amount of CA-related receivables as of the consolidated balance sheet date, net of an allowance for potential uncollectible amounts in the event of merchant fraud, diversion or default. For the purchased receivables, the Company is generally exposed to potential advance losses related to uncollectibility, and as such, the Company establishes an allowance for CA losses (“ALCAL”). Changes to the ALCAL are reflected as transaction costs on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss), according to company’s charge-off methodology.
The ALCAL is primarily based on expectations of credit losses based on historical lifetime loss data as well as macroeconomic forecasts applied to the portfolio, which is segmented by programs. Loss rates are generated using historical loss data for each portfolio and are applied to segments of each portfolio. The Company then applies macroeconomic factors such as market unemployment rate, current and forecasted GDP, S&P yield and inflation rate, which are sourced externally, using a single scenario that the Company believes is most appropriate to the economic conditions applicable to a particular period. Expected credit loss rates, inclusive of historical loss data and macroeconomic factors, are applied to the principal amount of the Company’s CA receivables.

Internal use software:
The Company accounts for costs incurred to develop or obtain software and other applications for internal use in accordance with ASC 350-40, 
Internal-Use Software
. Software purchased for internal use is accounted for as the acquisition of an intangible asset and is capitalized at cost. Costs related to developing software for internal use are expensed or capitalized depending on the project stage in which the costs are incurred. The Company capitalizes costs incurred during the application development stage, which include costs to design the software, application configuration, interfaces, coding, installation, and testing. Costs incurred during the preliminary project and post-implementation stages are expensed as incurred. 
Capitalized internal use software is presented within intangible assets, net on the consolidated balance sheets. The assets are amortized over the period of estimated benefit of 
1.2
-
3 years
, using the straight-line method, and related amortization is presented under depreciation and amortization on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). No significant residual value is estimated for internal use software. Costs incurred to maintain existing product offerings are expensed as incurred. The capitalization and ongoing assessment of recoverability of development cost requires considerable judgement by management.
l.
Cloud computing arrangements:
The Company enters into certain cloud-based software hosting arrangements. If management determines that a cloud computing arrangement conveys the right to a software license, the Company accounts for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other internal use software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the Company accounts for the arrangement as a service contract and expenses all costs not directly related to capitalizable implementation, including overhead costs and costs of service agreements, in the period they are incurred.
Costs related to implementation of cloud computing arrangements that qualify for capitalization are stated at cost less accumulated amortization within prepaid expenses, allocated between other current and other non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheets based on the expected amortization to be recognized within one year. Such capitalized costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the fixed, non-cancellable term of the associated hosting arrangement, plus any reasonably certain renewal periods, beginning when the cloud computing arrangement is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. The amortization expense of such capitalized costs are presented within the same financial statement line items as the associated service fees in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). 
As of December 31, 2024, the net carrying value of capitalized implementation costs included $
98
 and $
552
 in other current assets and other non-current assets, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had not begun to amortize those capitalized implementation costs.

NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued):
m.
Business combinations and asset acquisitions:
In evaluating purchase transactions, the Company first applies a screen test to determine if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. 
If the screen test is met, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition. The Company recognizes assets acquired in an asset acquisition based on the cost to the Company on a relative fair value basis, which includes transaction costs in addition to consideration transferred and liabilities incurred as part of the transaction. Neither goodwill nor bargain purchase gains are recognized in an asset acquisition.
If the screen test is not met, the Company further considers whether the set of assets or acquired entities have at a minimum, inputs and processes that have the ability to create outputs which would meet the definition of a business. The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when control is transferred to the Company. The consideration transferred in the acquisition is measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired. The fair value of the assets are considered significant estimates made by the Company. Any residual purchase price is allocated as goodwill. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if related to the issue of debt or equity securities. Any contingent consideration connected to the business combination is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition and each reporting period thereafter. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the business combination, with the corresponding offset recorded to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the Company’s consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) or as an adjustment to acquisition-related assets and liabilities.
n.
Goodwill and intangible assets:
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is allocated to the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. Goodwill is tested for impairment, at a minimum, on an annual basis at the reporting unit level by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the reporting unit does not pass the qualitative assessment, the reporting unit’s carrying value is compared to its fair value. Goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value.
The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow method. The discounted cash flow method, a form of the income approach, uses expected future operating results and a market participant discount rate. Failure to achieve these expected results, changes in the discount rate or market pricing metrics, may cause a future impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level. 
Intangible assets consist of internal use software (refer to note 2k), customer relationships, and acquired developed technology. Intangible assets are amortized over the period of estimated useful life using the straight-line method and have estimated useful lives as shown below. No significant residual value is estimated for intangible assets.
The Company computes amortization using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives as follows:

NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued):
The Company evaluates intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. An asset is considered impaired if its carrying value exceeds the future net cash flow the asset is expected to generate.
o.
Impairment of long-lived assets:
The Company reviews long-lived assets for their impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of the asset exceeded the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset, a write-down would be recorded to reduce the related asset to its estimated fair value.
p.
Leases:
The Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease for accounting purposes at contract inception by determining whether an asset is explicitly or implicitly identified in the arrangement, and whether the Company obtains the right to control the use of that asset. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had entered into operating leases for office facilities and employee vehicles and did not have any finance leases.
Operating leases are recorded as right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, which are presented as right-of-use assets, and lease liabilities, which are included in other payables and other long-term liabilities, on the consolidated balance sheets, depending on their classification as short- or long-term, respectively.
ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate; it uses an incremental borrowing rate for specific terms on a collateralized basis based on the information available on either the ASC 842, 
Leases
, transition date or lease commencement date, as applicable, in determining the present value of lease payments.
​
The ROU asset calculation accounts for lease payments and incentives. The ROU asset and lease liability may include amounts attributed to options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In certain instances, the Company may have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components. In these instances, the Company has elected to apply the practical expedient and account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for all leases. The Company applies a single portfolio approach within certain lease classes to account for the ROU assets and lease liabilities. The Company does not recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities arising from short-term leases.
q.
Warrants
The Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480, 
Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity
 (“ASC 480”) and ASC 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging
 (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s own shares of Common Stock and whether the warrant holders could potentially require different settlement value of consideration in a circumstance outside of the Company’s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance.

NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued):
For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a derivative liability at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as gain or loss on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). In accordance with ASC 825-10, 
Financial Instruments
, offering costs attributable to the issuance of the derivative warrant liabilities are recognized in the statements of comprehensive income (loss) as incurred.
r.
Treasury stock:
The Company accounts for repurchases of shares of its common stock as of the trade date, and includes in treasury stock the repurchase price plus any costs associated with the transaction. 
When and if treasury stock is reissued, the Company applies the average cost method to determine the value of the reissued shares. The Company credits gains on reissuances to additional paid-in capital and offsets losses against historical gains. Losses in excess of historical gains will be recognized against retained earnings.   
Treasury stock is included in authorized and issued shares but excluded from outstanding shares.
s.
Revenue recognition:
Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
The majority of the Company’s revenue is recognized and collected upon the completion of the underlying transaction. 
Card and customer account revenue:
1)
Transaction fee revenues - the Company’s transaction fee revenue principally consists of usage fees. Revenue may vary based on the size and volume of transactions, the payment methods used, the currencies to be ultimately disbursed and the countries to which the funds are transferred. Transaction fee revenues are recognized at a point in time which is the period when the underlying transactions occur, and at this time the amounts are known.
2)
Collection and loading fees - fees are charged to customers upon withdrawal of funds into a customer’s bank account or utilization of funds loaded or allocated to cards. Fees are recognized at a point in time which is the period that the underlying withdrawal or load to a customer occurs.
3)
Service and maintenance fees - maintenance and service fees are charged either monthly or annually to customers. Fees charged in advance to customers covering a single reporting period or multiple reporting periods are recognized when the fee is charged as there is no binding contract term and the fee does not represent a material right to the customer.
4)
Cancellations and refunds of fees - the Company records revenue net of transaction cancellation and refunds of fees. Cancellations and refunds of fees are estimated at the time that the underlying transaction occurs and are provided for in advance of the cancellation or refund.
Capital advance fees
:
The Company offers customers a cash advance in exchange for a fixed amount of their future receivables. Such customers use Payoneer’s payment services to receive payments from third-party online marketplaces for goods and services sold on the marketplaces. For the cash advances in which the Company retains the right to future receivables, the fee is recognized over the advance period. Refer to Note 2i for the Company’s accounting policy related to capital advance receivables.

NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued):
Global bank transfer revenue:
Revenues generated from bank transfers are recorded at the time the related funds transfer is executed and delivered to the beneficiary. Revenue is deferred until it reaches the beneficiary even if it has been collected by the Company at any point during the bank transfer process. The timing of recognition is dependent on geographic region, and overall reliance on third-party processors and financial institutions.
​
The Company uses third-party processors and financial institutions in executing foreign exchange transactions with third-parties. The Company acts as the principal in these transactions and recognizes revenue as it relates to these transactions on a gross basis as the Company controls the service to the end customer and directs third-party processors and other financial institutions to perform the specified services on the Company’s behalf. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any commissions or other payments to third-parties are recorded as transaction costs so that the net amount (gross revenue less transaction costs) is reflected in operating income (loss). The company charges both fixed and variable fees related to global bank transfers. Fixed fees are generally on a per transaction basis while variable are generally based on volume of transactions where transactions involve funds transferred to the Company in one currency which are transferred to a beneficiary in another currency.
​
Interest earned on customer funds balances:
As discussed in Note 2g, the Company holds customer funds in both interest and non-interest bearing accounts. Interest earned on these balances is recognized as revenue. 
​
Customer acquisition costs:
The Company capitalizes certain consideration paid to customers, which include costs associated with customer acquisition rewards, and certain costs to obtain contracts, which include employee sales commissions that are incremental to the acquisition of customer contracts. These costs are recorded as other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company determines whether costs should be deferred based on the incremental nature of the underlying cost and if the cost would not have occurred absent the customer acquisition.
Customer acquisition rewards primarily refers to incentive payments made to existing customers, third parties and new customers when a new customer is referred and utilizes the Company’s services, subject to certain conditions. Certain capitalized sales commissions include payments made to employees that are directly related to new customers’ acquisitions or increased revenue or volume for existing customers.
Amortization of customer acquisition rewards and sales commissions are consistent with the pattern of revenue recognition of each performance obligation. Incentives earned by customers and third parties for referring new customers are paid in exchange for a distinct service and accounted for as sales and marketing expenses on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Any amounts paid in excess of the fair value of the referral service received are recorded as a reduction of revenue. Fair value of the service is established using amounts paid to vendors for similar services. The Company has applied the practical expedient in ASC 340-40 to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the amortization period would have been one year or less.
The Company recognizes an asset for incremental costs to obtain a contract such as sales commissions and other customer incentives. The asset is amortized on a systematic basis over the expected customer relationship period, which is estimated as of December 31, 2024 to be 
2.42
 years. The amortization is recorded within sales and marketing expense on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).

NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued):
The Company offers various programs to acquire customers. In certain customer acquisition arrangements with existing customers, the payments to the customer are recorded as a reduction of revenue.
The Company periodically reviews these deferred customer acquisition costs to determine whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that could impact the period of benefit. There were 
no
 impairment losses recorded during the periods presented. 
t.
Transaction costs:
Transaction costs consist of fees paid to banks, processors and card networks, costs to acquire currencies, card supply costs and other fees related to the Company’s services. These costs are net of any rebate programs with banks, processors and networks, such as currency conversion assessment rebates and volume rebates. These costs are primarily driven by transaction size and volume.
The Company is exposed to potential transaction losses due to credit or debit collections, recalled payments and card negative balances and related chargebacks, including charge-offs related to CA. These losses are included in transaction costs. The Company established an allowance for estimated losses arising from processing customer transactions, which represents an accumulation of the estimated amounts necessary to provide for transaction losses incurred as of the reporting date, including those for which the Company has not yet identified. The allowance is monitored quarterly and is updated based on actual claims data. The allowance is based on known facts and circumstances as well as internal factors. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the provision for transaction losses, including the allowance for CA totaled $
8,004
 and $
7,418
, respectively, and was included in other payables, with the exception of the allowance for CA which is within CA receivables, net on the consolidated balance sheets. Transaction costs also include expenses related to the Warehouse Facility and are considered to be related party balances as further described within Notes 14 and 26.
u.
Other operating expenses:
Other operating expenses include compensation for the Company’s employees and contingent workforce who support customer service calls, card and account approval, banking infrastructure implementations, transactions monitoring and liquidity management as well as indirect costs incurred for fraud detection, compliance operations and maintenance costs related to the Company’s customer call center infrastructure.
v.
Sales and marketing expenses:
Sales and marketing include business development and product launch costs, marketing and advertising costs, retention and customer support costs, partnership commissions, and certain customer acquisition costs. This also includes employee compensation and related costs to support the sales and marketing process. Advertising and certain marketing costs are expensed as incurred and amounted to $
35,767

Research and development expenses are charged to the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) as incurred and consist primarily of employee compensation and related costs, professional services and consulting expenses, and non-capitalized costs associated with the development of new technologies.
x.
General and administrative expenses:
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation, benefits and overhead expenses associated with corporate management. This also includes, among other things, directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, director fees, internal and external accounting and legal and administrative resources, including audit and legal fees.

Stock-based compensation:
Equity awards granted to employees and non-employees are accounted for using the grant date fair value method. The grant date fair value is determined as follows: for restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and stock options with an exercise price, using the Black Scholes pricing model, for stock options or RSUs with market conditions and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), using a Monte Carlo model, and for RSUs and stock options with no or an insignificant exercise price with service conditions, based on the grant date share price. The fair value of share-based payment transactions is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.
​
The Company measures the compensation cost related to options, RSUs, and ESPP rights awarded on the grant date and recognizes the cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards. Cost of awards with service conditions and market-based conditions for vesting are recognized using the graded vesting method. For awards with market conditions, compensation expense is not reversed if the market conditions are not satisfied.
​
The Company measures the additional compensation cost of modified awards on the date of modification and recognizes the cost (1) on the modification date for past service periods and (2) on a straight-line basis over the future related service period. 
​
The fair value of an equity instrument issued to a non-employee is measured as of the grant date. The fair value of the awards is recognized over the vesting period, which coincides with the period that the counter-party provides services to the Company. 
​
The Company recognizes a tax benefit of stock-based compensation in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) if the tax benefit is realized.
​
The Company issues new shares for the ESPP and upon option exercise or RSU vesting.

Concentration of risks:
Credit risk concentration
Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, customer funds, restricted cash, and accounts receivable. The Company’s assets are held with various institutions, which may include banks, payment service providers, or other financial institutions throughout the world. The Company regularly reviews its relative exposure to financial and other institutions and has relationships with a globally diversified group of service providers. A significant portion of the Company’s funds are deposited at large depository institutions and global systematically important banks. The vast majority of those cash funds exceed applicable FDIC coverage insurance limits or are held with financial institutions in countries that do not offer deposit insurance and are subject to specific institutional, regional and country risks. The Company is also exposed to transaction losses due to funds blocked with its global bank transfers processors. See also Note 19.

% of its research and development resources. At this time, an insignificant amount of the Company’s Israeli workforce have been called to military reserve duty and the Company has contingencies in place to cover impacted roles and responsibilities. 
aa.
Income taxes:
Income taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach as required under U.S. GAAP. The asset and liability approach requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company’s financial statements or tax returns. The measurement of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets is based on provisions of the relevant tax law; the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated. Deferred taxes have not been provided on the amount of unremitted earnings from foreign subsidiaries retained for reinvestment in the Company. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when the likelihood of the deferred tax assets not being realized exceeds the more likely than not criterion. Deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, are classified as non-current assets or non-current liabilities on the balance sheets.
The Company follows the guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The guidance provides a comprehensive model for the recognition, measurement and disclosure in financial statements of uncertain income tax positions that a company has taken or expects to take on a tax return. Under this guidance, a company can recognize the benefit of an income tax position only if it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that the tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, based solely on the technical merits of the tax position; otherwise, no benefit can be recognized. The tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Additionally, the Company accrues interest and related penalties, if applicable, on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws. Interest and penalties are classified as taxes on income in the consolidated financial statements.

Recently issued accounting pronouncements:
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) standards adopted during 2024
In 2023, the FASB issued guidance, ASU 2023-07, that requires entities to report incremental information about significant segment expenses included in the segment measure of profit or loss, as well as the name and title of the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) and an explanation of how the CODM uses each reported measure of segment profit or loss. The guidance also requires interim disclosures related to reportable segment profit or loss and assets that had previously only been disclosed annually, and requires entities with a single reportable segment to provide all disclosures required by these amendments, and all existing segment disclosures. The new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024 and must be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 22 for required disclosures. 
​
FASB Standards issued, but not adopted as of December 31, 2024
In 2023, the FASB issued guidance, ASU 2023-09, which modifies the rules on income tax disclosures to require entities to disclose (1) specific categories in the rate reconciliation, (2) the income or loss from continuing operations before income tax expense or benefit (separated between domestic and foreign) and (3) income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations (separated by federal, state and foreign). It also requires entities to disclose their income tax payments (net of refunds received) to international, federal, state and local jurisdictions, among other changes. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this new guidance on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In 2024, the FASB issued guidance, ASU 2024-03, which requires the disaggregated disclosure of certain costs and expenses on an interim and annual basis. The new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027 and can be applied prospectively with the option for retrospective application to all prior periods presented in the financial statements, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this new guidance on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

100
% of the outstanding equity of Skuad Pte. Ltd. (“Skuad”) and its subsidiaries, a global workforce and payroll management company. The acquisition accelerates Payoneer’s strategy to deliver a comprehensive and integrated financial stack for SMBs that operate globally. The transaction was accounted for in accordance with ASC 805, 
Business Combinations 
(“ASC 805”), using the acquisition method of accounting with Payoneer as the acquirer. 
The following table summarizes the fair value of the consideration transferred:

Cash transferred was funded with cash on hand. The contingent consideration was in the form of a $
9,709
 earn-out subject to meeting certain performance criteria such as revenue and volume for eighteen months post-close, and achievement of certain business goals within twelve months post-close. The fair value of the contingent consideration recognized on the acquisition date of $
5,283
 was estimated using estimates of probability of each outcome and the Option Pricing Model (“OPM”), except for with respect to the integration plan target, which is not exposed to systemic risk. Note that as shown above, the Company has adjusted the acquisition date fair value of the contingent consideration via a measurement period adjustment of $
1,691
, recognized as an increase to acquisition date goodwill. This adjustment is a result of refinement of Management’s assumptions around Skuad’s business forecast, based on data that was available at the time of the acquisition. Refer to Note 7 below for details on changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration since acquisition.
The consideration transferred included settlement of a receivable on Payoneer's books, related to commercial payments activities that occurred prior to the closing of the business combination with Skuad, which is now an intercompany relationship eliminated in consolidation. No gain or loss was recognized on settlement. 
The settlement of unvested acquiree stock-based compensation awards relates to unvested Skuad stock options which were cancelled upon acquisition and either replaced with Payoneer RSUs or not replaced and settled in cash. Replacement awards included 
90,000
 RSUs which were measured at fair value based on the grant date share price. Additionally, the Company committed to grant 
1,870,577
 RSUs valued at $
10,364
, which are subject to ratable quarterly vesting contingent on future services and continued employment of the Skuad founder and shall be expensed over a remaining service period of up to 
three years
.

The excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill and is primarily attributable to the significant synergies expected to arise from the acquisition, including enhancement of Payoneer’s comprehensive and integrated financial stack. The Company does not expect goodwill to be deductible for income tax purposes. 
At the acquisition date, Payoneer recognized an indemnification asset in the amount of $
1,240
 related to uncertain tax positions of the acquiree. As noted in the table above, during the three months ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized an additional $
1,764
 in indemnification assets related to uncertain tax positions of the acquiree which existed at the acquisition date but had not yet been identified by the Company. There was no impact to earnings related to this adjustment. Payoneer is fully indemnified by the sellers for the full amount of the positions in the event that the related losses are realized. 
Due to Skuad’s insignificant size relative to the Company, Payoneer is not providing supplemental pro forma financial information for the current and prior reporting periods. During the year ended December 31, 2024, Payoneer incurred acquisition-related costs of $
4,900
, which were included in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). 
The allocation of the purchase price for this acquisition has been prepared on a preliminary basis and changes to the allocation to certain assets, liabilities, and tax estimates may occur as additional information becomes available throughout the measurement period, which will not exceed 12 months from the date of the acquisition.

As of December 31, 2024, the estimated fair value of the available-for-sale debt securities included $
2,943
 in unrealized gains and $
3,265
 in unrealized losses, net of tax. The gross unrealized losses of $
4,177
 related to assets with a fair value of $
446,423
, which had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than 12 months. 
Unrealized losses have not been recognized into income as the Company neither intends to sell, nor anticipates that it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell, the securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. The decline in fair value is due to changes in market interest rates, rather than credit losses. The Company will continue to monitor the performance of the investment portfolio and assess whether impairment due to expected credit losses has occurred.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company did not sell any available-for-sale debt securities or incur any realized gains or losses. 
As of December 31, 2024, $
305,773
 of the Company’s available-for-sale debt securities were due to mature within one year or less, and $
869,164
 were due to mature between one and five years.

NOTE 6 
-  DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING (continued):
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized $
12,045
 in unrealized losses, net of tax, on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges in OCI. As of December 31, 2024, the Company estimated that $
1,150
 of unrealized losses related to cash flow hedges currently included in AOCI are expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months. As of December 31, 2024, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions is 
58 months
. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company did not discontinue any cash flow hedges because it was probable that the original forecasted transaction would not occur and as such, did not reclassify any gains or losses to earnings prior to the occurrence of the hedged transaction.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company recognized an obligation to return cash collateral related to interest rate floors of $

The Company’s foreign currency derivative instruments are valued using pricing models that take into account the contract terms and relevant currency rates. The Company’s interest rate floors are valued using pricing models that take into account the contract terms and relevant interest rates. 
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair values of the Company's cash, cash equivalents, customer funds (other than the portion consisting of available-for-sale debt securities), restricted cash, accounts receivable, capital advance receivables, accounts payable, outstanding operating balances, and long-term debt approximated the carrying values of these instruments presented in the Company's consolidated balance sheets because of their nature. The fair value of long-term debt, when carrying value does not approximate fair value, is determined using Level 3 unobservable inputs and assumptions by the Company.

NOTE 10 – GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Goodwill
The Company conducted the annual impairment test of goodwill as of September 30, 2024. The Company elected to directly perform a quantitative analysis of fair value of the reporting unit compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit. Based on the results of this analysis, the Company determined that goodwill was not impaired. The Company has not recognized an impairment charge in any of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, or 2022. No triggering events have occurred since the annual impairment assessment that would change the Company’s assessment.

On August 2, 2023, Payoneer Inc. and Payoneer Research & Development Ltd., wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company, purchased certain assets and intellectual property of Spott Incredibles Technologies Ltd. (“Spott”) for a total consideration of $
3,600
, and committed to $
400
 of future payments contingent on Spott’s former employees’ continued employment with Payoneer Research & Development Ltd.

NOTE 11 – INVESTMENT IN ASSOCIATED COMPANY
In July 2019, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Payoneer Research and Development Ltd., entered into an agreement for the establishment of a joint venture company in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”). The objective of the joint venture was to apply for a local payment service provider license in accordance with PRC laws. The Company’s share in the Joint Venture was 
46
%, and the remaining ownership interest was held by 
two
 local partners. Initial funds in the amount of $
6,501
 were contributed. The investment in the joint venture was presented as an investment in associated company in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as the Company did not have control over the joint venture.
In January 2023, the Company, through Payoneer Research and Development Ltd., acquired all remaining interests from other partners in the joint venture for cash consideration of $
7,961
. As part of the agreement, the acquiring company assumed responsibility for all expenses and income incurred or earned through the date of acquisition related to the joint venture. 
As substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets of the joint venture were concentrated in a group of similar assets (cash and cash equivalents and restricted deposits in the amount of $
13,914
), the Company accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition. As such, the Company’s basis in the acquired assets is valued at the amount of consideration transferred.

NOTE 14 – DEBT
​
On October 28, 2021, Payoneer Early Payments Inc. (“PEPI”), a wholly-owned second tier subsidiary of the Company and its subsidiary (the “Borrower”) entered into a Receivables and Loan Security Agreement (the “Warehouse Facility”) with Viola Credit VI, L.P. (currently known as Viola Credit ALF II, L.P.), Viola Credit Alternative Lending FNX SPV, L.P. (the “Lenders”) and Viola Credit Alternative Lending Management 2018 L.P. (collectively, the “Parties”) for the purpose of external financing of Capital Advance activity. The Company notes that the Lenders are related parties through the Company’s Board of Directors’ chairman’s ownership interest in the Lenders. Refer to Note 26 for further information regarding related party considerations.
In accordance with the Warehouse Facility, the Lenders made available to the Company an initial committed amount of $
25,000
, which was permitted to be increased at the request of the Company, and with the consent of the Lenders, in $
25,000
 increments up to $
100,000
. The associated borrowings were secured by the assets of the Borrower, which consist primarily of capital advance receivables as well as a pledge of the equity of the Borrower. The recourse under the Warehouse Facility was limited to Borrower's assets, and no other Payoneer entity guaranteed repayment by the Borrower. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, $
0
 and $
32,468
 was pledged as collateral and included within Capital advance receivables on the consolidated balance sheets. 
The Warehouse Facility stipulated a borrowing base calculated at an advance rate of 
80
% out of the eligible portfolio outstanding receivables balance.
On and after July 1, 2023, the Warehouse Facility bore interest at the sum of the Daily Simple 
SOFR
 and 
0.26161
% plus:
●
9.00
%
 per annum if the commitment amount is 
$
25,000
;
●
7.75
%
 per annum if the commitment amount is 
$
50,000
;
●
7.50
%
 per annum if the commitment amount is 
$
75,000
;
●
7.00
%
 per annum if the commitment amount is 
$
100,000
.
Prior to July 1, 2023, interest on the facility was calculated as the greater of 
0.25
% or LIBOR plus the additional percentage amounts per annum based on commitment amount noted above.
On June 8, 2022, the Warehouse Facility was amended to create a condition that the total interest rate, calculated as the sum per above, was not to exceed 
10.5
% per annum for all outstanding balances.
The revolving period of the facility was 
36 months
 from the closing date and the maturity date is 
42 months
 from the date the Warehouse Facility was entered into. The Warehouse Facility reached its scheduled revolving period termination date on October 28, 2024, and the Company has repaid all outstanding borrowings. The Warehouse Facility is set to be automatically terminated on April 28, 2025.
The Company recorded expenses included in transaction cost in the total amount of $
1,399
, $
1,781
 and $
1,491
 for the years ended at December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, there was

NOTE 17 – SEVERANCE PAY FUND AND ACCRUED SEVERANCE PAY
While the Company maintains immaterial severance pay liabilities in several jurisdictions globally, the following discussion covers the severance arrangement in Payoneer Research and Development Ltd. (“The Israeli Subsidiary”), which is its most material arrangement and makes up substantially all of the severance pay liabilities included within Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
Labor laws in Israel and employment agreements require paying severance pay to employees that are dismissed or retire from their employment in certain circumstances, according to a defined benefit plan. Employees (for whom the Company makes regular deposits in pension and severance pay funds according to a defined benefit plan) dismissed before attaining retirement age are entitled to severance pay computed on the basis of their latest pay rate. In respect of these employees, the Company is committed to supplement the difference between severance pay computed as above and the amounts accumulated in the abovementioned funds. Commencing in 2011, the Israeli Subsidiary added Section 14 of the Severance Pay Law - 1963 to new employees’ agreements that eliminates the need to accrue provisions for retirement expenses for these employees, other than periodic payments made on behalf of the employees that are expensed periodically. The accrued severance pay liability was $
1,190

and $
1,472
 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

NOTE 17 – SEVERANCE PAY FUND AND ACCRUED SEVERANCE PAY (continued):
The Israeli Subsidiary’s severance pay liability for the Israeli employees is covered mainly by the purchase of insurance policies. The value of these policies is recorded as an asset in the consolidated balance sheets. The balance of the severance pay fund was $

and $

 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
NOTE 18 – WARRANTS AND SHAREHOLDER’S EQUITY
Share Repurchase Program and Treasury Stock
On May 7, 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program that provides for the repurchase of up to $
80,000
 of its common stock, including any applicable excise tax. On December 7, 2023, the Board authorized an amendment to the program to increase the authorized amount of repurchases to an aggregate amount not to exceed $
250,000
, including the amount that remained available as of December 7, 2023 to repurchase common stock under, but not any prior repurchases effected pursuant to, the previous authorization, and any applicable excise tax. The amended authorization expires December 31, 2025. 
The program is intended to offset the impact of dilution from the issuance of new shares as part of employee 
compensation
 programs.
Any share repurchases under this stock repurchase program may be made through open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions or other means including in accordance with Rule 10b-18 and/or Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The timing and total amount of repurchases is subject to business and market conditions and the Company’s discretion.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company repurchased 
24,807,647
 shares of its common stock for $
136,788
, including taxes and fees, at a weighted average cost of $
5.50
 per share, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company repurchased 
11,064,692
 shares of its common stock for $
56,936
, including taxes and fees, at a weighted average cost of $
5.13
 per share, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, a total of approximately $
103,773
 remained available for future repurchases of the Company’s common stock under the program.  
Common Stock
Holders of common stock are entitled to 
one
 vote per share and to receive dividends, when declared. The holders have no preemptive or other subscription rights and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions with respect to such shares.
Warrants
On June 25, 2021, Payoneer Inc. (a subsidiary company) and FTAC Olympus Acquisition Corporation (“FTOC”) consummated a previously announced business combination through a merger of subsidiaries under a newly formed holding company (the “Reverse Recapitalization”). The Company had publicly traded warrants that were assumed upon the Reverse Recapitalization, and were exercisable for shares of the Company’s common stock. Warrants were only exercisable for a whole number of shares at an exercise price of $
11.50
 and would expire on June 25, 2026, or earlier, if redeemed. In September 2024, the Company completed a tender offer (the “Offer”) to repurchase all outstanding Warrants, at $
0.78
 per Warrant. Concurrently with the Offer, the Company solicited consents (the “Consent Solicitation”) from holders of its outstanding Warrants to amend the agreement governing the Warrants (the “Warrant Agreement”) to permit the Company to redeem all Warrants that remained outstanding after the completion of the Offer for $
0.70
 per Warrant in cash, without interest.

0.70

NOTE 19 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
The Company’s business is subject to various laws and regulations in the United States and other countries from where the Company operates. Any regulatory action, tax or legal challenge against the Company for noncompliance with any regulatory or legal requirement could result in significant fines, penalties, or other enforcement actions, increased costs of doing business through adverse judgment or settlement, reputational harm, the loss of banking or other operational relationships, the diversion of significant amounts of management time and operational resources, and could require changes in compliance requirements or impose limits on the Company’s ability to expand its product offerings, or otherwise harm or have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. From time to time, the Company incurs insignificant fines and penalties in the ordinary course of business.
On September 28, 2021, the National Banking and Securities Commission (CNBV) and the Bank of Mexico revoked the banking license of a banking entity utilized by the Company due to the banking entity not meeting applicable capital requirements. As a result, the Company is unable to withdraw funds from the banking entity. The Company has reserved $
2,250
 for potential losses related to those funds above the recovered amount. The Company applied for and recovered the maximum statutory reimbursement through the deposit insurance provided by Mexican Institute for the Protection of Banking Services (IPAB), totaling $
140
. The Company has filed a claim in liquidation for the remaining funds; however, the percentage of the deposit that will be recovered in liquidation is not known at this time.
On August 7, 2023, Payoneer (Guangzhou) Commerce Services Co., Ltd. (“Payoneer Guangzhou”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into an agreement with a non-bank payments institution (the “Licenseholder”), that offers pay-out and mobile payments solutions to merchants in the People’s Republic of China and holds a Payment Business License issued by the People’s Bank of China (the “PBoC”). Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Payoneer Guangzhou seeks to purchase the Licenseholder, and placed approximately $
4
 million in escrow in October 2023, representing a small portion of the agreed upon consideration for the purchase. In the event of termination of the agreement, such escrow amount will be returned to Payoneer Guangzhou, and in the event of a successful transaction, it will be applied to the full purchase price. In February 2025, the Company received the regulatory approvals in China required to complete the acquisition, which is subject to customary closing conditions and termination provisions provided for in the agreement.
From time to time, the Company is involved in other disputes or regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business. These may include suits by its customers alleging, among other things, acting unfairly and/or not in conformity regarding pricing, rules or agreements, improper disclosure of the Company’s prices, rules, or policies or that the Company’s practices, prices, rules, policies, or customer agreements violate applicable law.
In addition to these types of disputes and regulatory inquiries, the operations of the Company are also subject to regulatory and/or legal review and/or challenges that tend to reflect the increasing global regulatory focus to which the industry in which the Company operates is subject and, when taken as a whole with other regulatory and legislative action, such actions could result in the imposition of costly new compliance burdens on the Company and may lead to increased costs and decreased transaction volume and revenue.
Any claims or regulatory actions against the Company, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, settlement payments, damage awards (including statutory damages for certain causes of action in certain jurisdictions), fines, penalties, injunctive relief, or increased costs of doing business through adverse judgment or settlement, require the Company to change its business practices, require significant amounts of management time, result in the diversion of operational resources, or otherwise harm the business.

Based on the information provided to and reviewed by the Company’s CODM, the Company believes that the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of its revenue and cash flows and how they are affected by economic factors are most appropriately depicted through its primary regional markets. The following table presents the Company’s revenue disaggregated by primary regional market, with revenues being attributed to the country (in the region) in which the billing address of the transacting customer is located, with the exception of global bank transfer revenues, where revenues are disaggregated based on the billing address of the transaction funds source.
Note that in 2024, the Company has updated the definition of its primary regional markets to align with the view used by Management. This update eliminates South Asia, Middle East and North Africa as a separate region and instead includes revenues from South Asia in the Asia-Pacific region and Middle East and North Africa in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa region. The update has been applied to all periods reflected in the table below.

NOTE 23 – STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
​
Option and restricted stock compensation plans
The Company maintains 
three
 stock-based compensation incentive plans: the Payoneer Inc. 2007 Share Incentive Plan and the Payoneer Inc. 2007 U.S. Share Incentive Plan (hereafter together – the “2007 Plan”), the Payoneer Inc. 2017 Stock Incentive Plan (hereafter – the “2017 Plan”) and the 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”).
●
2007 Plan - 
In February 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the 2007 Plan, where up to 
3,360,000
 incentive awards (including stock options and RSUs) were available for grants to employees of the Company and other individuals eligible under the plan. Subsequent to the original plan approval, there were several periodic increases in options that were available for grant through approval by the Company’s board of directors and stockholders. The 2007 Plan is no longer available for grants of new awards as of 2017.
●
2017 Plan - In May 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the 2017 Plan, where up to 
21,756,714
 incentive awards (including stock options and RSUs) were available for grant to employees of the Company and other individuals eligible under the Plan. Awards generally vest over a 
four year
 period and continued vesting of any outstanding award is usually subject to continued service of the person to whom the award was granted. The 2017 Plan is no longer available for grants of new awards as of 2021.
●
2021 Plan – In June 2021, the Company's Board of Directors adopted the 2021 Plan, pursuant to the approval of the 2021 Plan by the shareholders of the Company. The plan allows the granting of incentive awards (including stock options and RSUs) to employees of the Company and other individuals eligible under the Plan. Awards granted under the plan generally vest over a 
four year
 period and continued vesting of any outstanding award is usually subject to continued service of the person to whom the award was granted. 
o
2021 Transaction Bonus Pool - The Company approved and adopted the Transaction Bonus Pool under the 2021 Plan, associated with the Reverse Recapitalization in 2021. The RSUs associated with the Transaction Bonus Pool are subject to certain market-based and service conditions. 
Fifty
 percent of those RSUs would have vested if at any time during the 30 months following the closing date, the closing share price of Company Shares was greater than or equal to 
$
15.00
 over any 
20 days
 trading within any 
30
 trading days period (which threshold did not occur, and as a result, the right to these shares was forfeited); and the remaining 
50
%
 of those RSUs shall vest if at any time during the 60 months following the closing date, the closing share price of Company Shares is greater than or equal to 
$
17.00
 over any 
20
 trading days within any 
30
 trading days period, subject to the grantee's continued employment with, or service to, the Company or any of its affiliates (if applicable) until and including the time the RSUs vest.
Under each of the plans, no options shall be exercisable after the expiration of 
10 years
 after the effective date of grant.

The vesting period of the outstanding options is generally

 from the date of grant. The following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the stock options granted by the Company. The year ended December 31, 2023 is excluded from this table as there were no new options granted by the Company in 2023:

​
The Company selected the Black-Scholes Merton option pricing model as the most appropriate fair value method for its stock options awards based on the market value of the underlying shares at the date of grant. Historical information for a selection of similar publicly traded companies was the basis for the expected volatility. Historical information and management expectations were the basis for the expected dividend yield. The expected lives of the options are based upon the simplified method per ASC 718, 
Compensation – Stock Compensation. 
The risk-free interest rate was selected based upon yields of U.S. Treasury issues with a term equal to the expected life of the option being valued. Option vesting generally occurs in tranches up to 
four years
.
As of December 31, 2024, there were approximately $
3,385
 of unrecognized compensation costs outstanding, related to unamortized stock option compensation which are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 
1.85
 years. Total unrecognized compensation cost will be recognized as incurred. In addition, as future grants are made, additional compensation costs will be incurred.

​
NOTE 24 - INCOME TAXES (continued):
Deferred taxes are determined utilizing the asset and liability method based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial accounting and tax bases of assets and liabilities under the applicable tax laws. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management takes into account various factors, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income by jurisdiction, tax planning strategies, and results of recent operations. Based on this evaluation, a valuation allowance of $
19,180
 and $
19,281
 has been recorded as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, to recognize only the portion of the deferred tax asset, primarily related to Germany deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized. In the determination of the appropriate valuation allowances, the Company has considered the most recent projections of future business results and taxable income by jurisdiction. Actual results may vary in comparison to current projections.
After consideration of the evidence described above, management believes it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be realized for the United States and the Israeli subsidiary. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded a release of $
10,553
 in respect of the valuation allowance applied on deferred tax assets recorded in the United States. Due to a record of historical taxable losses, management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in Germany and a full valuation allowance remained in effect as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had state tax net operating loss carryforwards of $
637
. Though the Company’s state net operating loss carryforwards were insignificant as of December 31, 2024, these net operating losses can be utilized to reduce future taxable income, if any. Utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations under the tax laws of the different states. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of state net operating loss carryforwards before utilization. If not utilized, the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2029. The Company also has net operating losses in Germany of approximately $
62,860
, which may be carried forward indefinitely to offset future taxable income in Germany. It is more likely than not that the majority of the German net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized; therefore, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance against them.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, provisions have not been made for income taxes on the undistributed earnings that were deemed permanently reinvested in foreign subsidiaries. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities on these earnings is not practicable because such liabilities, if any, depend on certain circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs. A deferred tax liability will be recognized if and when the Company no longer plans to permanently reinvest these undistributed earnings.

The material uncertain tax positions relate to transfer pricing adjustments in foreign jurisdictions. The Company believes that is reasonably possible that much of the unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change within 12 months of the reporting date due to open tax examinations. However, a reasonable estimate of the range of possible changes cannot be made. As of December 31, 2024, the Company recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of $
41,759
, all of which, if recognized, would affect the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued on uncertain income tax positions as part of the income tax provision. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company incurred penalties related to income taxes of $
186
, $
38
, and $
50

NOTE 25 – NET EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE 
The Company computes net earnings (loss) per share using the two-class method required for participating securities. The two-class method requires income available to common shareholders for the period to be allocated between shares of Common Stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the period had been distributed.
The Company’s basic net earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period, without consideration of potentially dilutive securities. The diluted net earnings (loss) per share is calculated by giving effect to all potentially dilutive securities outstanding for the period using the treasury share method or the if-converted method based on the nature of such securities. Diluted net earnings (loss) per share is the same as basic net earnings (loss) per share in periods when the effects of potentially dilutive shares of common stock are anti-dilutive. Instruments with an antidilutive effect, for which conditions were not met, or which were not in the money in the reporting period were excluded from the diluted net earnings (loss) per share calculation for the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. Refer below for details on specific exclusions.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objective and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act).
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and the oversight of our audit committee, has evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, our management used the framework established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on that evaluation, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. 
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by Kesselman & Kesselman, a member of PricewaterhouseCoopers International Limited, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which can be found in Part II Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Inherent Limitation on the Effectiveness of Internal Control
The effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, is subject to inherent limitations, including the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing, operating, and evaluating the controls and procedures, and the inability to eliminate misconduct completely. Accordingly, in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable, not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

This trading arrangement was adopted by a family limited partnership of which Mr. Goldman is a general partner.

The original expiration date of this trading arrangement was November 15, 2025. Under this trading arrangement, up to 
99,253
 shares of common stock could be sold. In addition, common stock could be sold in amounts which represent the net amount of shares remaining following a withholding of shares to cover tax obligations upon the vesting of 11,250 restricted stock units on various dates during the plan. The number of net shares to be sold to accomplish this purpose could not be reliably determined at the time of adoption, as it depends upon the share price on the vest date. Mr. Perry’s trading arrangement also covered and included any common stock purchased by Mr. Perry under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), which purchase occurred on November 15, 2024 for the applicable offering period.
(3)
Under this trading arrangement, up to 27,145 shares of common stock may be sold. In addition, common stock may be sold in amounts which represent the net amount of shares remaining following a withholding of shares to cover tax obligations upon the vesting of 89,187 restricted stock units on various dates during the plan. The number of net shares to be sold to accomplish this purpose cannot be reliably determined at this time, as it will depend upon the share price on the vest date. Mr. Perry’s trading arrangement also covers and includes any common stock purchased by Mr. Perry under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), which purchase is expected to occur on May 30, 2025 for the current offering period. Employees enrolled in the ESPP for the current offering period were entitled to make their purchase elections in October, 2024.
