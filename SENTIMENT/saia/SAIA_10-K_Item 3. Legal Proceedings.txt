Executive Overview

The Company’s business is highly correlated to non-service sectors of the general economy. The Company’s strategy is to improve profitability by increasing revenue per shipment while also increasing volumes. Components of this strategy include building density in existing geography and pursuing geographic and terminal expansion in an effort to promote profitable growth and improve our customer value proposition over time. The Company’s business is labor intensive, capital intensive and service sensitive. The Company looks for opportunities to improve safety, cost

35

effectiveness and asset utilization (primarily tractors and trailers). Pricing initiatives have had a positive impact on profitability. The Company continues to execute targeted sales and marketing programs along with initiatives to align costs with volumes and improve customer satisfaction. Technology continues to be an important investment as we work towards improving customer experience, operational efficiencies and Company image.

The Company’s operating revenue increased by 11.4 percent in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase was a result of increased volume and pricing actions, which included 7.9, 7.5 and 6.5 percent general rate increases on October 21, 2024, December 4, 2023 and January 30, 2023, respectively, for customers subject to general rate increases. Additionally, the Company experienced year over year increases in shipments and tonnage partially as a result of the redistribution of freight due to industry consolidation mid-year 2023. These increases were offset by a decrease in fuel surcharge revenue, resulting from lower diesel fuel prices.

Consolidated operating income increased to $482.2 million for 2024 compared to $460.5 million in 2023. The increase in 2024 operating income resulted primarily from increased volumes partially offset by increases in salaries, wages and benefits, including workers' compensation claims and related expense, and depreciation expense.

The Company generated $583.7 million in net cash provided by operating activities in 2024 versus $577.9 million in 2023. The Company used $1,035.9 million of net cash in investing activities during 2024 compared to $448.7 million during 2023.

General

The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis describes the principal factors affecting the results of operations, liquidity and capital resources, as well as the critical accounting policies of Saia, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (together, the Company or Saia). This discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements which include additional information about our significant accounting policies, practices and the transactions that underlie our financial results.

Saia is a transportation company headquartered in Johns Creek, Georgia that provides less-than-truckload (LTL) services through a single integrated organization. While more than 97% of its revenue is derived from transporting LTL shipments across the United States, the Company also offers customers a wide range of other value-added services, including non-asset truckload, expedited and logistics services across North America.

Our business is highly correlated to non-service sectors of the general economy. Our business also is impacted by a number of other factors as discussed under “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and Part I, Item 1A., “Risk Factors.” The key factors that affect our operating results are the volumes of shipments transported through our network, as measured by our average daily shipments and tonnage; the prices we obtain for our services, as measured by revenue per shipment and revenue per hundredweight (a measure of yield), whether including or excluding fuel surcharge revenue; our ability to manage our cost structure for capital expenditures and operating expenses such as salaries, wages and benefits; purchased transportation; claims and insurance expense; fuel and maintenance; and our ability to match operating costs to shifting volume levels.

Revenue and volume

Consolidated revenue increased 11.4 percent to $3.2 billion primarily due to increased shipments and tonnage, partially as a result of a redistribution of freight due to a competitor bankruptcy in 2023.  Saia’s LTL tonnage  increased 8.9 percent while LTL shipments increased 12.4 percent for 2024. Overall LTL revenue per shipment, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 1.1 percent in 2024 as a result of pricing actions and changes in business mix. For 2024 and 2023, approximately 75 percent of Saia’s operating revenue was subject to specific customer price adjustment negotiations that occur throughout the year. The remaining 25 percent of operating revenue was subject to a general rate increase which is based on market conditions. For customers subject to general rate increases, Saia implemented 7.9, 7.5 and 6.5 percent general rate increases on October 21, 2024, December 4, 2023 and January 30, 2023, respectively. Competitive factors, customer turnover and mix changes, among other things, impact the extent to which customer rate increases are retained over time.

37

Operating revenue includes fuel surcharge revenue from the Company’s fuel surcharge program. This program is designed to reduce the Company’s exposure to fluctuations in diesel fuel prices by adjusting total freight charges to account for changes in the price of diesel fuel. The Company’s fuel surcharge is generally based on the average national price for diesel fuel and is typically reset weekly. Fuel surcharges are widely accepted in the industry and are a significant component of revenue and pricing. Fuel surcharges are an integral part of customer contract negotiations but represent only one portion of overall customer price negotiations, as customers may negotiate increases in base rates instead of increases in fuel surcharges or vice versa. Fuel surcharge revenue decreased to 15.0 percent of operating revenue in 2024 compared to 16.9 percent in 2023 primarily as a result of decreases in the cost of diesel fuel.

Operating expenses and margin

Consolidated operating income increased to $482.2 million in 2024 compared to $460.5 million in 2023. The increase in 2024 operating income resulted primarily from increased volumes which were partially offset by increases in salaries, wages and benefits, including workers' compensation claims and related expense, and depreciation expense. The 2024 operating ratio (operating expenses divided by operating revenue) was 85.0 percent as compared to 84.0 percent in 2023.

Salaries, wages and employees’ benefits expense increased $186.6 million in 2024 compared to 2023.  This increase was largely driven by increased head count to support increased volumes, ongoing business growth and network expansion, as well as, increased training hours and a Company-wide wage increase in July 2024 of approximately 4.1 percent, excluding executives. In addition, other employee related costs increased, including an increase in the number and costs of workers' compensation claims and unfavorable development of historical claims. Purchased transportation expense decreased $1.4 million in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to a decrease in cost per mile. Fuel, operating expenses and supplies increased by $65.7 million primarily driven by increased facility costs and administrative costs related to increased volumes and expanded footprint. Claims and insurance expense in 2024 was $9.7 million higher than 2023 largely due to increased auto liability and cargo claims activity and development of open claims. The Company experiences volatility in accident expense from time to time as a result of utilizing self-insurance as a part of its risk management program. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $31.3 million in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to ongoing investments in revenue equipment and network expansion.

Other

Interest expense in 2024 was $6.4 million greater than 2023 due to interest expense related to increased borrowings under the credit arrangements in 2024. Interest income in 2024 was $5.2 million less than 2023 due to due to decreased deposit balances during the period. The effective income tax rate was 23.9 percent for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Outlook

Our business remains highly correlated to non-service sectors of the general economy and competitive pricing pressures, as well as the success of Company-specific improvement initiatives. Our outlook is dependent on a number of external factors, including strength of the economy, inflation, changes in regulatory conditions and international trade relations, including higher tariffs, labor availability, diesel fuel prices and supply chain constraints.  The potential impact of these factors on our operations, financial performance and financial condition, as well as the impact on our ability to successfully execute our business strategies and initiatives, remains uncertain and difficult to predict. We are continuing initiatives to improve and enhance customer service in an effort to support our ongoing pricing and business mix optimization, while seeking to control costs and improve productivity. Planned revenue initiatives include building density in our current geography, targeted marketing initiatives to grow revenue in more profitable areas and further expanding our geographic and terminal network. On October 21, 2024, Saia implemented a 7.9 percent general rate increases for customers comprising approximately 25 percent of Saia’s operating revenue. The success of these revenue initiatives is impacted by what proves to be the underlying economic trends, competitor initiatives and other factors discussed under “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and Part I, Item 1A., “Risk Factors.”

38

Effective July 2024, the Company implemented a salary and wage increase of approximately 4.1 percent for all of its employees, excluding executives. The total cost of the compensation increase is expected to be approximately $59.0 million annually, and the Company anticipates the impact will be partially offset by productivity and efficiency gains.

The strategic objective of the Company is to build market share through excellent customer service, continued operating efficiencies and through its geographic and terminal expansion which should result in numerous operating leverage cost benefits. However, should the economy soften, the Company plans to match resources and capacity to shifting volume levels to lessen unfavorable operating leverage. The success of cost improvement initiatives is impacted by a number of factors, including the cost and availability of drivers, dock workers and personnel, and purchased transportation, diesel fuel and insurance costs and inflation.

See “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and Part I, Item 1A., “Risk Factors,” for a more complete discussion of potential risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operation, cash flows and prospects.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in 2024

In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2023-07, “
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.
” The standard requires all entities with a single reportable segment to apply all segment disclosure requirements. This standard became effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company adopted the standard on a retrospective basis for the 2024 annual reporting period with the impact limited to incremental disclosures in our consolidated financial statements.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, “
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.
” Under this ASU income tax disclosures are expanded primarily by requiring the disaggregation of the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disclosures. This standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, 
"Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses." 
Under this ASU, entities are required to disclose additional disaggregated information related to certain expense captions included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. This standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company's liquidity needs arise primarily from capital investment in new equipment, land and structures, information technology and letters of credit  and surety bonds required under insurance programs, as well as funding working capital requirements.

Working Capital and Capital Expenditures

Working capital at December 31, 2024 was $157.4 million compared to $326.6 million at December 31, 2023. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $276.7 million to fund the Yellow Corporation real estate acquisitions and additional revenue equipment used to support higher volumes and expanded footprint, partially offset by an increase in income taxes receivable and decreases in accounts payable and wages, vacation and employees' benefits.

Cash flows from operating activities were $583.7 million for 2024 versus $577.9 million for 2023 largely driven by increased depreciation and amortization and deferred income taxes, partially offset by changes in other assets and liabilities. For 2024, net cash used in investing activities was $1,035.9 million versus $448.7 million in 2023 primarily due to the acquisition of terminals from Yellow Corporation in January 2024 in addition to increased purchases of revenue equipment to support higher volumes and expanded footprint. Net cash used in financing activities was $175.4 million in 2024 versus $20.4 million in 2023 as a result of borrowings to fund capital expenditures during 2024.

The Company has historically generated cash flows from operations to fund a large portion of its capital expenditure requirements. The Company believes it has adequate sources of capital to meet short-term liquidity needs through its cash on hand, operating cash flows and availability under its credit arrangements. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has $473.8 million of availability under its Revolving Credit Facility and $250 million of uncommitted financing under the Company's Private Shelf Agreement, subject to certain conditions. Future operating cash flows are primarily dependent upon the Company’s profitability and its ability to manage its working capital requirements, primarily accounts receivable, accounts payable and wage and benefit accruals. The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants at December 31, 2024.

Net capital expenditures pertain primarily to investments in tractors and trailers and other revenue equipment, information technology, land and structures. Projected net capital expenditures for 2025 are expected to be over $700 million compared to 2024 net capital expenditures of $1.0 billion. Estimated 2025 capital expenditures include a normal replacement cycle of revenue equipment and technology investments for our operations, and additional revenue equipment and real estate investments to support our growth initiatives.

See “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and Item 1A., “Risk Factors,” for a more complete discussion of potential risks and uncertainties that could materially affect our future performance and financial condition.

Credit Arrangements

Revolving Credit Facility

The Company is a party to an unsecured credit agreement with its banking group (the Revolving Credit Facility). On December 9, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility. The amendment increased commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by $300 million to an aggregate commitment of $600 million and expanded the accordion feature, subject to certain conditions and availability of lender commitments, from $150 million to $300 million. This amendment also extended the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility from February 3, 2028, to December 9, 2029. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at the Company’s election at a variable rate equal to (a) one, three or six month term SOFR (the forward-looking secured overnight financing rate) plus 0.10%, or (b) an alternate base rate, in each case plus an applicable margin. Additionally, the amendment adjusted the applicable margin such that the applicable margin is now between 1.25% and 2.00% per annum for term SOFR loans and between 0.25% and 1.00% per annum for alternate base rate loans, in each case based on the Company’s consolidated net lease adjusted leverage ratio. The amendment also modified the fees that the Company accrues based on the daily unused portion of the credit facility, which will now range between 0.175% and 0.30% based on the Company’s consolidated net lease adjusted leverage ratio. The Revolving Credit Facility contains certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and provisions relating to events of default. Under the Revolving Credit Facility, if an event of default occurs, the banks will be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due. Under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company is subject to a maximum consolidated net lease adjusted leverage ratio of less than 3.50 to 1.00 with the potential to be temporarily increased in the event the Company makes an acquisition that meets certain criteria. The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility at December 31, 2024.

At December 31, 2024, the Company had outstanding borrowings of  $94.0 million and outstanding letters of credit of $32.2 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. At December 31, 2023, the Company had no outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit of $32.1 million under the Revolving Credit Facility.

 See Note 2, "Debt and Financing Arrangements" of the accompanying audited Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the Revolving Credit Facility.

Private Shelf Agreement

On November 9, 2023, the Company entered into a $350 million uncommitted Private Shelf Agreement (the Shelf Agreement), with PGIM, Inc. (Prudential), and certain affiliates and managed accounts of Prudential (the Note Purchasers) which allows the Company, from time to time, to offer for sale to Prudential and its affiliates, in one or a series of transactions, senior notes of the Company, through November 9, 2026.

Pursuant to the Shelf Agreement, on May 1, 2024, the Company issued senior promissory notes (the Initial Notes) in an aggregate principal amount of $100 million to the Note Purchasers. The Initial Notes bear interest at 6.09% per annum and mature on May 1, 2029, unless repaid earlier by the Company. The Initial Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank pari passu with borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility or other senior promissory notes issued pursuant to the Shelf Agreement.

Additional notes issued under the Shelf Agreement, if any, would bear interest at a rate per annum, and would have such other terms, as would be set forth in a confirmation of acceptance executed by the parties prior to the closing of the applicable sale transaction.

The Shelf Agreement requires that the Company maintain a consolidated net lease adjusted leverage ratio of less than 3.50 to 1.00, with limited exceptions.  The Shelf Agreement also contains certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and provisions related to events of default.  Upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default, the holders of notes issued under the Shelf Agreement may require immediate payment of all amounts owing under such notes. The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants under the Shelf Agreement at December 31, 2024.

41

At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had outstanding notes under the Shelf Agreement of $100.0 million and $0, respectively.

See Note 2, "Debt and Financing Arrangements" of the accompanying audited Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the Shelf Agreement.

Finance Leases

The Company is obligated under finance leases with seven-year terms for revenue equipment totaling $6.3 million and $16.5 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Amortization of assets held under the finance leases is included in depreciation expense. The weighted average interest rates for the finance leases at December 31, 2024 and 2023 were 4.09% and 3.95%, respectively.

Contractual Obligations

Contractual obligations for the Company are comprised of lease agreements, purchase obligations and long-term debt obligations related to any outstanding balance under the credit arrangements. Total contractual obligations for operating leases at December 31, 2024 totaled $147.3 million. This includes operating leases with original maturities of less than one year, which are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheet in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Contractual obligations in the form of finance leases were $6.4 million at December 31, 2024, which include both principal and interest components. Purchase obligations at December 31, 2024 were $27.7 million. As of December 31, 2024 the Revolving Credit Facility had $94.0 million outstanding principal balance and the Shelf Agreement had $100.0 million outstanding principal balance. See Note 2, "Debt and Financing Arrangements" of the accompanying audited Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the credit arrangements.

Other commercial commitments of the Company typically include letters of credit and surety bonds required for collateral under insurance agreements. As of December 31, 2024 the Company had total outstanding letters of credit of $32.2 million and $60.6 million in surety bonds.

In addition to any principal amounts disclosed, the Company has interest obligations of approximately $13.4 million for 2025, based on borrowings and commitments outstanding at December 31, 2024.

The Company has accrued approximately $3.2 million for uncertain tax positions and accrued interest and penalties of $0.4 million related to the uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2024.

At December 31, 2024, the Company has $109.5 million accrued for claims, insurance and other liabilities.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The Company makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements that affect reported amounts and disclosures therein. In the opinion of management, the accounting policies that generally have the most significant impact on the financial position and results of operations of the Company include:

•
Claims and Insurance Accruals
.    

o
Description
:
 The Company is self-insured for portions of workers’ compensation, bodily injury and property damage, casualty, cargo loss and damage and group health claims.    

o
Judgments and Uncertainties
:
 Claims and insurance accruals for these claims are established by management based on estimates of losses that the Company will ultimately incur on reported claims and on claims that have been incurred but not yet reported.  Accruals are calculated on reported claims based on an evaluation of the nature and severity of the claim, historical loss experience and on legal, economic and other factors.  Actuarial analysis is also used in calculating the accruals for workers’ compensation and bodily injury and property damage claims.

o
Sensitivity of Estimate to Change
:
 These accruals could be significantly affected if the actual costs of these claims differ from the estimates and assumptions used to establish the accruals. A 

42

significant number of these claims typically take several years to develop and even longer to ultimately settle. These accruals have been reasonably accurate over time; however, changes to estimates and assumptions regarding severity of claims, medical cost inflation, as well as specific case facts can create short-term volatility in these accruals. A 100 basis point change in our loss development factors would result in an immaterial change in the claims and insurance accruals. There have been no material changes in the development factors for the year ended December 31, 2024.

•
Revenue Recognition and Related Allowances
.    

o
Description
:
 Revenue is recognized over the transit time of the shipment as it moves from origin to destination while expenses are recognized as incurred.  Estimates included in the recognition of revenue and accounts receivable include estimates related to shipments in transit and estimates of future adjustments to revenue and accounts receivable for billing adjustments and collectability.

o
Judgments and Uncertainties
:
 Revenue is recognized in a systematic process whereby estimates related to shipments in transit are based upon actual bills of lading received near period end and the estimated percentage of completion of the service at period end. Estimates for credit losses and billing adjustments are based upon historical experience.  

o
Sensitivity of Estimate to Change
:
 Since the cycle for pick-up and delivery of shipments is generally one to five days, typically less than ten percent of a total month’s revenue is in transit at the end of any month. Estimates included in the recognition of revenue and accounts receivable are continuously evaluated and updated; however, changes in economic conditions, customer creditworthiness, pricing arrangements and other factors may significantly impact these estimates.

•
Depreciation of Assets
.    

o
Description
: Under the Company’s accounting policy for property and equipment, management establishes depreciable lives and salvage values for the Company’s revenue equipment (tractors and trailers) based on their estimated useful lives and estimated residual values to be received when the equipment is sold or traded in. These estimates are routinely evaluated and updated when circumstances warrant.

o
Judgments and Uncertainties
:
 Selecting the appropriate accounting method for depreciation requires management judgment, as there are multiple acceptable methods that are in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, including straight-line, declining-balance, and sum-of-the-years' digits. The Company depreciates property and equipment on straight-line and declining-balance bases over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The Company believes these methods properly spread the costs over the useful lives of the assets.

Factors affecting estimated useful lives and residual values of property and equipment may include estimating loss, damage, obsolescence, and Company policies around maintenance and asset replacement.

o
Sensitivity of Estimate to Change
:
 Actual useful lives and residual values could differ from these assumptions based on market conditions and other factors, thereby impacting the estimated amount or timing of depreciation expense. See Note 1, "Description of Business and Summary of Accounting Policies" of the accompanying audited Consolidated Financial Statements, for discussion of the effects of changes to judgments related to depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2024.

These accounting policies and others are described in further detail in the Notes to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to adopt accounting policies and make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. In many cases, there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used. We maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the consolidated

43

financial statements. However, even under optimal circumstances, estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitat
ive Disclosures About Market Risk

The Company is exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of interest rates and diesel fuel prices. The detail of the Company’s debt structure is more fully described in the Notes to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in this Form 10-K. To help mitigate our exposure to rising diesel fuel prices, the Company has an established fuel surcharge program.

The following table provides information about the Company’s debt as of December 31, 2024. The table presents annual principal cash flows (in millions) and related weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates. The fair value of fixed rate debt is based on current market interest rates for similar types of financial instruments, reflective of level two inputs. The carrying amount of the Company’s variable rate debt approximates fair value as interest rates approximate the current rates available to the Company.

Report of Independent Regis

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
Saia, Inc.:

Opinion on the

Consolidated Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Saia, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 24, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Evaluation of the estimated liabilities for self-insured workers’ compensation and bodily injury claims

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has recorded estimated liabilities for claims related to workers’ compensation and bodily injury. These liabilities are recorded within claims and insurance accruals (current) of $43.1 million, and claims, insurance, and other (non-current) of $66.4 million, as of December 31, 2024.
We identified the evaluation of the estimated liabilities for self-insured workers’ compensation and bodily

46

injury claims as a critical audit matter because of the inherent uncertainty in the amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle these claims. Factors that may affect the settlement cost of claims include the length of time the claim remains open, its potential severity, and the results of litigation. Additionally, the Company’s liabilities include estimates for future development of claims and specialized skills were needed to evaluate the actuarial methods and assumptions used to make these estimates.

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s self-insurance processes, including controls over the methods and assumptions used in estimating the liabilities. We evaluated the Company’s accruals for a selection of reported claims by comparing the individual accruals to current available information, which included claim files and attorneys’ letters, and we tested the Company’s historical paid loss data by inspecting a sample of claim payments. In addition, we involved an actuarial professional with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted by comparing the Company’s actuarial methods with generally accepted actuarial methods and evaluating the key assumptions used in determining the liabilities.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
Saia, Inc.:

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited Saia, Inc. and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 24, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to Consolidated
 Financial Statements

December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022

1.    Description of Business and Summary of Accounting Policies
Description of Business
Saia, Inc., and its subsidiaries (Saia or the Company), is headquartered in Johns Creek, Georgia. Saia is a leading, less-than-truckload (LTL) motor carrier with more than 
97
%
 of its revenue derived from transporting LTL shipments for customers.  In addition to the core LTL services provided in the United States, the Company also offers customers a wide range of other value-added services, including non-asset truckload, expedited transportation and logistics services across North America.

Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Saia, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.

Use of Estimates
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Management makes its best estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and other information available when the financial statements are prepared. Changes in estimates are recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for the estimate, which is typically in the period when new information becomes available to management. Areas where the nature of the estimate makes it reasonably possible that actual results could materially differ from amounts estimated include: revenue reserves; self-insurance accruals; long-term incentive compensation; tax liabilities; loss contingencies; litigation claims; and impairment assessments on long-lived assets and goodwill.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in 2024
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2023-07, “
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.
” The standard requires all entities with a single reportable segment to apply all segment disclosure requirements. This standard became effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024. 
The Company adopted the standard on a retrospective basis for the 2024 annual reporting period with the impact limited to incremental disclosures in our consolidated financial statements.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, 
“Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.”
 Under this ASU, income tax disclosures are expanded primarily by requiring the disaggregation of the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disclosures. This standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

54

In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, 
"Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses." 
Under this ASU, entities are required to disclose additional disaggregated information related to certain expense captions included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. This standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

Summary of Accounting Policies
Significant accounting policies and practices used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements are as follows:
Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand and short term marketable securities with original maturities of three months or less.

Spare

Parts, Fuel and Operating Supplies:
    Spare parts, fuel and operating supplies on hand are carried at average cost and are included in other current assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Property and Equipment:
    Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Replacements and improvements that extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized, while repairs and maintenance that do not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets are charged to expense as incurred. The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable.
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method, except for tractors (included in revenue equipment) for which the declining-balance method is used. The following service lives are used to compute depreciation:

$

2,881,800

The Company’s investment in technology equipment and software consists primarily of systems to support customer service, maintenance and freight management. Depreciation and amortization expense (including amortization of assets under finance leases) was $
209.2
 million, $
177.9
 million and $
156.2
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The Company periodically evaluates estimated useful lives of property and equipment considering its planned and actual usage, planned and actual maintenance and replacement, and other relevant physical and economic factors that may affect our use of the assets. During the second quarter of 2024, the Company determined that the estimated useful lives of certain of its trailers and dollies should be extended from 
14 
years to 
20 
years. This change was recognized prospectively. The changes in estimates resulted in an increase in income from continuing operations of approximately 
$
7.7
 million (a $
5.8
 mil
lion increase in net income) for the year ended December 31, 2024.

55

Claims and Insurance Accruals:
    The Company maintains a significant amount of insurance coverage with third-party insurance carriers that provides various levels of protection for covered risk exposure, including in the areas of workers’ compensation, bodily injury and property damage, casualty, cargo loss and damage and group health, with coverage limits and retention and deductible amounts that vary based on policy periods and claim type.  Claims and insurance accruals related to workers’ compensation, bodily injury and property damage, casualty, cargo loss and damage and group health are established by management based on estimates of losses that the Company will ultimately incur on reported claims and on claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. Accruals are calculated on reported claims based on an evaluation of the nature and severity of the claim, historical loss experience and on legal, economic and other factors. Actuarial analysis is also used in calculating the accruals for workers’ compensation and bodily injury and property damage claims.
Income Taxes:
    Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period enacted. As required by FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 740, 
Income Taxes
, the Company defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax-filing positions in the financial statements as “more-likely-than-not” to be sustained by the tax authority.
Revenue Recognition:
    The Company’s revenues are derived primarily from the transportation of freight as it satisfies performance obligations that arise from contracts with its customers.  The Company’s performance obligations arise when it receives a bill of lading (BOL) to transport a customer's commodities at negotiated prices contained in either a transportation services agreement or a publicly disclosed tariff rate. Once a BOL is received and accepted, a legally-enforceable contract is formed whereby the parties are committed to perform and the rights of the parties, shipping terms and conditions, and payment terms have been identified. Each shipment represents a distinct service that is a separately identified performance obligation.

The typical transit time to complete a shipment is from 
one
 to 
five days
.  Billing for transportation services normally occurs after completion of the service and payment is generally due within 
30
 days after the invoice date. The Company recognizes revenue related to the Company’s LTL, non-asset truckload and expedited transportation services over the transit time of the shipment as it moves from origin to destination based on the transit status at the end of each reporting period.
Key estimates included in the recognition and measurement of revenue and related accounts receivable are as follows:
•
Revenue associated with shipments in transit is recognized ratably over transit time; and
•
Adjustments to revenue for billing adjustments and collectability.
The portion of the gross invoice related to interline transportation services that involve the services of another party, such as another LTL service provider, is not recorded in the Company’s revenues.  Revenue from logistics services is recognized as the services are provided.
Credit Risk:
    The Company routinely grants credit to its customers. The risk of significant loss in trade receivables is substantially mitigated by the Company’s credit evaluation process, short collection terms, low revenue per transaction and services performed for a large number of customers, with no single customer representing more than 
5
 percent of accounts receivable at year-end. Allowances for potential credit losses are based on historical loss experience, current economic environment, expected trends and customer specific factors.
Stock-Based Compensation:
    The Company has various stock-based compensation plans for its employees and non-employee directors. The Company stock-based compensation includes awards of stock options, restricted stock awards, and stock-based performance unit awards, all of which are accounted for under FASB ASC Topic 718, 
Compensation-Stock Compensation
.  Stock options granted to employees are valued using a Black-Scholes-Merton model with the expense amortized over the three-year vesting period. Restricted stock is valued based on the fair market value of the Company's common stock at the date of grant and the expense is amortized over the 
three
 to 
five 

56

year
 vesting period. Stock-based performance unit awards are valued using a Monte Carlo model and the expense is amortized over the three-year vesting period.
Intangible Assets:
    The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that impairment may have occurred. The Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative assessment. The Company is not required to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the Company determines, based on qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. Purchased intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.

Advertising:
    The costs of advertising are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs charged to expense were $
5.0
 million, $
2.9
 million, and $
7.2
 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022
, respectively.
Financial Instruments:
    The carrying amounts of financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximated fair value as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, because of the relatively short maturity of these instruments. See Note 2 for fair value disclosures related to debt.
Segment Reporting:
    Saia is comprised of a single reportable segment organized around its transportation services. The segment provides core LTL and a wide range of other value-add transportation services to its customers based on negotiated prices contained in either a transportation services agreement or a publicly disclosed tariff rate. Saia derives revenue primarily in the United States and manages its business activities on a consolidated basis using an integrated transportation network.
The chief operating decision maker (CODM) is the Chief Executive Officer who regularly reviews the operating results of the Company's single operating segment at the consolidated company level. The accounting policies of the segment are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. The CODM assesses performance for the segment and determines how to allocate resources based on Saia's consolidated net income.
The CODM uses net income to evaluate income generated from segment assets (return on assets) in deciding whether to reinvest profits into the Company or for other purposes, such as for acquisitions, to repay borrowings or to pay dividends. The CODM also uses net income to monitor budget versus actual results, and in competitive analysis by benchmarking to the Company’s competitors. The competitive analysis along with the monitoring of budgeted versus actual results are used in assessing performance of the Company and in establishing management’s compensation.
The measure of segment assets is reported on the balance sheet as total consolidated assets.

The Company's liquidity needs arise primarily from capital investment in new equipment, land and structures, information technology and letters of credit and surety bonds required under insurance programs, as well as funding working capital requirements.
The Company is party to a credit agreement with a group of banks as well as a private shelf debt agreement to fund capital investments, letters of credit and working capital needs.

Credit Arrangements
Revolving Credit Facility
The Company is a party to an unsecured credit agreement with its banking group (the Revolving Credit Facility). On December 9, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility. The amendment increased commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by $
300
 million to an aggregate commitment of $
600
 million and expanded the accordion feature, subject to certain conditions and availability of lender commitments, from $
150
 million to $
300
 million. This amendment also extended the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility from February 3, 2028, to December 9, 2029. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at the Company’s election at a variable rate equal to (a) one, three or six month term SOFR (the forward-looking secured overnight financing rate) plus 
0.10
%, 
or (b) an alternate base rate, in each case plus an applicable margin. Additionally,

58

the 
amendment adjusts the applicable margin such that the applicable margin is now between 
1.25
% and 
2.00
% per annum for term SOFR loans and between 
0.25
% and 
1.00
% per annum for alternate base rate loans, in each case based on the Company’s consolidated net lease adjusted leverage ratio. The amendment also modifies the fees that the Company accrues based on the daily unused portion of the credit facility, which will now range between 
0.175
% and 
0.30
% based on the Company’s consolidated net lease adjusted leverage ratio. The Revolving Credit Facility contains certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and provisions relating to events of default. Under the Revolving Credit Facility, if an event of default occurs, the banks will be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due. Under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company is subject to a maximum consolidated net lease adjusted leverage ratio of less than 
3.50
 to 1.00 with the potential to be temporarily increased in the event the Company makes an acquisition that meets certain criteria. The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility at December 31, 
2024
At December 31, 2024, the Company had outstanding borrowings of  
$
94.0
 million
 and outstanding letters of credit of $
32.2
 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. At December 31, 2023
, the Company had 
no
 outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit of $
32.1
 million under the Revolving Credit Facility.
The carrying amount of the Company’s variable rate debt approximates fair value as interest rates approximate the current rates available to the Company.
Private Shelf Agreement
On November 9, 2023, the Company entered into a $
350
 million uncommitted Private Shelf Agreement (the Shelf Agreement), with PGIM, Inc. (Prudential), and certain affiliates and managed accounts of Prudential (the Note Purchasers) which allows the Company, from time to time, to offer for sale to Prudential and its affiliates, in one or a series of transactions, senior notes of the Company, through November 9, 2026.

Pursuant to the Shelf Agreement, on May 1, 2024, the Company issued senior promissory notes (the Initial Notes) in an aggregate principal amount of $
100
 million to the Note Purchasers. The Initial Notes bear interest at 
6.09
% per annum and mature on May 1, 2029, unless repaid earlier by the Company. The Initial Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank pari passu with borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility or other senior promissory notes issued pursuant to the Shelf Agreement.

Additional notes issued under the Shelf Agreement, if any, would bear interest at a rate per annum, and would have such other terms, as would be set forth in a confirmation of acceptance executed by the parties prior to the closing of the applicable sale transaction.

The Shelf Agreement requires that the Company maintain a consolidated net lease adjusted leverage ratio of less than 
3.50
 to 1.00, with limited exceptions.  The Shelf Agreement also contains certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and provisions related to events of default.  Upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default, the holders of notes issued under the Shelf Agreement may require immediate payment of all amounts owing under such notes. The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants under the Shelf Agreement at December 31, 
2024.
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had outstanding notes under the Shelf Agreement of 
$
100.0
 million
 and 
$
0
, respectively. The estimated fair value of these notes approximates book value for each year.

Finance Leases
The Company is obligated under finance leases with seven-year terms which include obligations collateralized by revenue equipment totaling $
6.3
 million and $
16.5
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Amortization of assets held under the finance leases is included in depreciation and amortization expense.

The estimated fair value of the finance leases at December 31, 2024 and 2023 is 
$
6.3
 million
  and 
$
16.1
 million
, respectively, which is based on current market interest rates for similar types of financial instruments, reflective of Level 2 inputs.

59

Other
The Company paid cash for interest of $
7.7
 million, $
1.6
 million, and $
2.3
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
, respectively.

3.    Commitments, Contingencies and Uncertainties
The Company has contractual obligations and commitments in the form of finance leases, operating leases and purchase commitments.

At December 31, 
2024, the Company was committed under non-cancellable operating lease agreements requiring minimum annual rentals payable as follows (in thousands):

Purchase commitments related to capital expenditures were $
27.6
 million at December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had $
24.4
 million and $
50.9
 million, respectively, of capital expenditures accrued for in accounts payable.
Other
The Company is subject to legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of its business. Management believes that adequate provisions for resolution of all contingencies, claims and pending litigation have been made for probable and estimable losses and that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition but could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations in a given quarter or annual period.

4.    Leases
The Company’s leases include, but are not limited to, real estate, including terminals and general office buildings, trailers, corporate fleet vehicles and other equipment. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet; the Company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, approximately 
$
18.2
 million
 and 
$
38.6
 million
, respectively, of finance leased assets, net of amortization, were included in 
property and equipment
.  Accumulated amortization for these assets totaled 
$
16.2
 million
 and 
$
31.2
 million
 as of the same periods ended.

7.    Stockholders’ Equity
Deferred Compensation Plan
The Saia Executive Capital Accumulation Plan (Capital Accumulation Plan) is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for Saia executives. The Capital Accumulation Plan allows for the plan participants to invest in the Company’s common stock. Elections to invest in the Company’s common stock are irrevocable, and upon distribution, the funds invested in the Company’s common stock are paid out in Company common stock rather than

62

cash. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s rabbi trust, which holds the investments for the Capital Accumulation Plan, held 
70,100
 and 
69,672
 shares of the Company’s common stock, respectively, all of which were purchased on the open market.
The following table summarizes the shares of the Company’s common stock that were purchased and sold by the Company’s rabbi trust (in thousands except share amounts):

Directors’ Deferred Compensation
Under the Company’s Directors’ Deferred Fee Plan, non-employee directors may elect to defer all or a portion of their annual fees and retainers. Such deferrals are converted into units equivalent to the value of the Company’s stock. Upon the director’s termination, death or disability, accumulated deferrals are distributed in the form of Company common stock in accordance with elections made by the directors. The Company had 
101,951
 and 
100,110
 shares reserved for issuance under the Directors’ Deferred Fee Plan at December 31, 2024 and 2023
, respectively. The shares reserved for issuance under the Directors’ Deferred Fee Plan are treated as common stock in computing basic earnings per share.

8.    Stock-Based Compensation
The stockholders of the Company approved the 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the 2018 Omnibus Plan) and the Second Amended and Restated 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the 2011 Omnibus Plan) to allow the Company to issue equity based compensation to help attract and retain executive, managerial, supervisory or professional employees and non-employee directors. The 2018 Omnibus Plan has 
1,100,000
 shares of common stock reserved.  The 2011 Omnibus Plan had a total of 
2,350,000
 shares of common stock reserved. Following stockholder approval of the 2018 Omnibus Plan, 
no
 additional awards have been made under the 2011 Omnibus Plan.
The 2018 Omnibus Plan and the 2011 Omnibus Plan provide for the grant or award of stock options; stock appreciation rights; restricted and unrestricted stock; restricted stock units; and performance unit awards.
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
391,089
 shares remain reserved and unissued under the provisions of the 2011 Omnibus Plan, a portion of which are allocated to outstanding stock options described below. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
633,409
 and 
677,500
 shares, respectively, remain reserved and unissued under the provisions of the 2018 Omnibus Plan, a portion of which are allocated to outstanding performance unit awards, outstanding stock options and restricted stock described below. The Company has historically issued new shares to satisfy stock option exercises or other awards issued under the 2018 Omnibus Plan and 2011 Omnibus Plan.
Stock option awards have been granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of the Company’s stock at the date of grant. Stock option awards granted to employees under the plans to date are non-qualified stock options, have vesting over 
three years
, subject to earlier vesting upon a change of control and certain other events, and have a 
seven-year
 contractual term.
 The Company grants shares of restricted stock as part of its long-term incentive plan. These shares of restricted stock generally vest over 
three years
, 
subject to earlier vesting upon a change of control and certain other events. The value of restricted stock is based on the fair market value of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant. In

63

addition, 
the Company has periodically granted shares of restricted stock to certain key executives that vests 
25
% after 
three years
, 
25
% after 
four years
 and the remaining 
50
% after 
five years
, assuming the executive has been in continuous service to the Company since the award date, subject to earlier vesting upon a change of control and certain other events.

Performance Unit Awards
The Company grants performance unit awards to executives as part of the Company’s long term incentive plan. The criteria for payout of the awards is based on a comparison over the three-year performance period of these awards of the total stockholder return (TSR) of the Company’s common stock compared to the TSR of the companies in a peer group established by the Compensation Committee. These stock-based awards are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 718 with the expense amortized over the 
three-year
 vesting period based on the fair value of the awards at the grant date measured using the Monte Carlo method. Operating results include expense for the performance unit awards of $
5.3
 million in 2024, $
4.5
 million in 2023 and $
3.8
 million in 2022. Shares earned under the performance unit awards are issued in the first quarter of the year following the end of the performance period. There was an issuance of 
23,434
 shares for the January 2022 - December 2024 performance period in February 2025, 
25,716
 shares for the January 2021 - December 2023 performance period in February 2024, and 
63,188
 shares for the January 2020 - December 2022 performance period in February 2023. At December 31, 2024, performance unit awards are outstanding for a maximum of 
27,838
 shares for the January 2022 – December 2024 performance period and for a maximum of 
15,914
 shares for the January 2023 – December 2025 performance period.  As of December 31, 2024, there is unrecognized compensation expense of $

Item 9A. Controls
 and Procedures

Annual Controls Evaluation and Related CEO and CFO Certifications

As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its “disclosure controls and procedures” (Disclosure Controls). The Disclosure Controls evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO).

Based upon the controls evaluation, the Company’s CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company’s Disclosure Controls are effective to ensure that information the Company is required to disclose in reports that the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms.

During the fourth quarter of 2024 covered by this Form 10-K, there were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Attached as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 to this Annual Report are certifications of the CEO and the CFO, which are required in accordance with Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act. This Controls and Procedures section includes the information concerning the controls evaluation referred to in the certifications and it should be read in conjunction with the certifications.

Definition of Disclosure Controls

Disclosure Controls are controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported timely. Disclosure Controls are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company’s Disclosure Controls include components of its internal control over financial reporting which consists of control processes designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Company’s financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls

The Company’s management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that its Disclosure Controls or its internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

69

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of Saia, Inc. and its subsidiaries is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, the Company’s management used the criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s assessment included a review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls and testing of the effectiveness of controls.  Based on this assessment, management has concluded that as of December 31, 2024, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has issued an audit report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, which report appears on page 
48
 of this Form 10-K.
