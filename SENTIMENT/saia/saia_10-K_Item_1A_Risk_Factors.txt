The Director of Information Security and Compliance assesses our cybersecurity readiness through internal assessment tools as well as third-party control testing, vulnerability assessments and evaluation against industry standards. We maintain compliance structures that are designed to elevate issues relating to cybersecurity to our Director of Information Security and Compliance and to our Executive Vice President and Chief Information Officer.

The Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for Saia’s strategic and operational risks.  Although the Board has delegated oversight responsibility for certain risks to its committees, the Board has determined that oversight for cybersecurity should remain with the full Board.
