Business
OVERVIEW
Amkor is the world’s largest U.S. headquartered OSAT (outsourced semiconductor assembly and test) service provider.  Since its founding in 1968, Amkor has pioneered the outsourcing of integrated circuit (“IC”) packaging and test services and is a strategic manufacturing partner for the world’s leading semiconductor companies, foundries, and electronics original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”).  Amkor provides turnkey manufacturing services for the communication, computing, automotive and industrial and consumer markets, including smartphones, data centers, artificial intelligence, electric vehicles and wearables.  Amkor’s operational base includes production facilities, research and development centers and sales and support offices located in key electronics manufacturing regions in Asia, Europe and the United States.  Amkor has built a leading position by:
•
Designing and developing innovative packaging and test technologies focused on advanced packaging solutions in high growth markets, including artificial intelligence;
•
Building expertise in high-volume manufacturing processes and developing a reputation for high quality and solid execution; 
•
Cultivating long-standing relationships with our customers and industry partners;
•
Focusing on strategic end markets that offer solid growth potential;
•
Providing a geographically diverse operating base with manufacturing facilities in multiple countries across Asia and in Europe; and
•
Developing a competitive cost structure through disciplined capital investment.
Our packaging and test services are designed to meet application and chip-specific requirements, including: the required type of interconnect technology; size; thickness; and electrical, mechanical and thermal performance.  We provide turnkey packaging and test services including wafer bump, wafer probe, wafer back-grind, package design, packaging, system-level and final test and drop shipment services.  Our customers use us for one or more of these services.
We provide our services to integrated device manufacturers (“IDMs”), “fabless” semiconductor companies, OEMs and contract foundries.  IDMs generally design, manufacture, package and test semiconductors in their own facilities.  However, the availability of technologically advanced outsourced manufacturing services has encouraged IDMs to outsource a portion of their manufacturing.  By offering a broad package portfolio, Amkor allows IDMs to outsource packaging and test services and focus their investments on core competencies such as silicon fabrication.  Fabless semiconductor companies do not have factories.  They focus exclusively on semiconductor design and outsource virtually every step of the manufacturing process, utilizing contract foundries to manufacture their semiconductors in wafer form and companies such as Amkor for their packaging and test needs.  Some companies will engage a contract foundry to manage the complete semiconductor manufacturing process, and, in turn, the contract foundry will outsource some of its packaging and test needs.
INDUSTRY BACKGROUND

•
The increase in digital format in our environment, from sensors for automobiles (e.g., pressure, radar, LiDAR and image recognition), mobile devices (e.g., 3D motion, temperature, acceleration and imaging), and IoT (e.g., in-home sensing from temperature to weather and wearables).
As a supplier in the semiconductor industry, our business is cyclical and impacted by broad economic factors, such as worldwide gross domestic product and consumer spending.  With the exception of 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic caused worldwide gross domestic product levels to decline during a period of strong growth in the semiconductor industry, there has generally been a strong correlation between worldwide gross domestic product levels, consumer spending and semiconductor industry cycles.  The semiconductor industry has experienced significant and sometimes prolonged cyclical upturns and downturns in the past.  We cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any correction, economic slowdown, recession or subsequent economic recovery. 
Outsourcing Trends in Semiconductor Manufacturing
Semiconductor companies outsource their packaging and test needs to service providers such as Amkor for the following reasons:
Packaging and test service providers have developed expertise in advanced technologies.
The increasing demands for miniaturization, greater functionality, lower power consumption and improved thermal and electrical performance are driving the continuous development of semiconductor packaging and test technologies that are more sophisticated, complex, capital intensive and customized.  This trend has led many semiconductor companies and OEMs to view packaging and test as enabling technologies that can benefit from the technological innovation expertise found in the leading outsourced assembly and test companies.  At the same time, these companies are often looking to reduce their internal manufacturing and research and development costs for packaging and test solutions.  As a result, many of these companies are increasingly relying on packaging and test service providers as key sources for new package designs and advanced interconnect technologies.  
Packaging and test service providers can facilitate a more efficient supply chain and help shorten time-to-market for new products.
We believe that semiconductor companies, together with their customers, are seeking to shorten the time-to-market for new products and that an efficient supply chain is a critical factor in facilitating timely and successful product introductions.  Packaging and test service providers have the resources and expertise to timely develop and implement new packaging technology in high volume.  For this reason, semiconductor companies and OEMs are leveraging the capabilities of outsourced packaging and test service providers to bring new high quality products to market more quickly.

Table of Contents
High quality packaging and test service providers enable semiconductor manufacturers to focus their resources on semiconductor design and wafer fabrication.
As semiconductor process technology migrates to larger wafers and smaller feature sizes, the cost of building a state-of-the-art wafer fabrication factory has risen significantly.  The high cost of investing in next generation silicon technology and equipment is causing many semiconductor companies to adopt or maintain a “fabless” or “fab-lite” strategy to reduce or eliminate their investment in wafer fabrication and associated packaging and test operations.  As a result, these companies are increasing their reliance on outsourced providers of semiconductor manufacturing services, including high quality packaging and test solutions.
Packaging and test service providers offer a cost-effective solution in a cyclical, capital intensive industry.
The semiconductor industry is cyclical by nature and impacted by broad economic factors, such as changes in worldwide gross domestic product and consumer spending.  Semiconductor packaging and test are complex processes requiring substantial investment in specialized equipment, factories and human capital.  As a result of this cyclicality and the large investments required, manufacturing facilities must operate at consistently high levels of utilization to be cost-effective.  Shorter product life cycles, coupled with the need to update or replace packaging and test equipment to accommodate new package types, make it more difficult for IDMs to maintain cost-effective utilization of their packaging and test assets throughout semiconductor industry cycles.  Packaging and test service providers, on the other hand, can typically use their assets to support a broad range of customers and multiple end markets, potentially generating more efficient use of their production assets and a more cost-effective solution.

Advanced Products
Our Advanced Products include flip chip chip scale packages (“FC CSP”), wafer-level packages and flip chip ball grid array (“FCBGA”) packages.  These package families use flip chip interconnect technology so that the die can be connected to a substrate package carrier or, in the case of wafer-level chip scale packages, directly to a printed circuit board.
FC CSP Products
:  FC CSP packages are small form factor packages where the substrate size is not much larger than the die itself.  FC CSP can be a single die or multi die format.  The size advantage provided by CSP technologies has made FC CSP an attractive choice for a wide variety of applications that require very small form factors, such as smartphones, tablets and other mobile consumer electronic devices.
Flip chip stacked chip scale packages (“FC SCSP”) stack a second die on top of the original flip-chip die.  The top die is typically a memory device, and wirebond interconnects are used to attach the top die to the substrate.  FC SCSP is frequently used to stack memory on top of digital baseband and applications processors for use in mobile devices.
We continue to drive thinner package solutions for our Package on Package (“PoP”) technology through the development of ultra-thin substrates and enhancing our pre-stacking and thin die handling capabilities.
We developed fine pitch copper pillar flip chip interconnect technology, which creates interconnections at finer pitches using a plating process to reduce the number of substrate layers to facilitate very thin packages.  This innovative solution is also an enabling technology for package stacking with TSVs.
FCBGA Products:
  FCBGA packages are large form factor substrate-based packages which are used where processing power and speed are a higher priority than a small form factor.  Our FCBGA packages are assembled using state-of-the-art substrates.  Utilizing multiple high density routing layers, laser drilled vias, and ultra-fine line and space metallization, FCBGA substrates have the highest routing density available.  The variety of FCBGA package options, from large single die to multi-chip packages with memory, allows package selection to be tailored to the specific thermal needs of the end product.  We offer FCBGA packaging in a variety of product formats to fit a wide range of end application requirements, including networking, storage, computing, automotive and consumer applications.  Some FCBGA products incorporate 2.5D technology, which utilizes high density silicon interposers to enable the integration of high-performance chips, such as high bandwidth memory and graphics processors, into a single package. 
Memory Products:
 Memory packages consist of either standalone packaging and testing or a combination of NAND Flash, DRAM, or a memory controller IC using a variety of packaging technologies, including FC, SCSP, SiP, PoP and 
8
Table of Contents
other state-of-the-art packaging technologies.  These products are used as system memory or platform data storage in all of our end markets.  
Wafer-level Package Products
:  We offer three types of wafer-level packages: wafer-level CSP; WLFO; SiPh and CPO; and SWIFT.  Wafer-level CSP and WLFO are complementary technologies.  Customers can choose between the two package types as their die sizes shrink or grow.
•
Wafer-level CSP packages (also known as fan-in wafer-level packages) do not utilize a package carrier.  The bumped wafer is singulated into individual die, and the wafer-level package is then attached directly to the system board.  Wafer-level CSP offers one of the lowest total system costs, enabling higher semiconductor content while leveraging the smallest form factor and one of the highest performing, most reliable semiconductor package platforms on the market today.  Applications for wafer-level CSP include power management, transceivers, sensors, wireless charging, codecs, and specialty silicon for new or unique functionality.
•
WLFO packages (also known as low-density fan-out packages) are utilized for ICs where the die surface area is too small to accommodate all of the required bond pads.  The fan-out package enlarges the bondable surface area by building a border around the die using low-cost molding compound.  These packages can include multiple die.  Applications for WLFO packages include power management, transceivers, radar and specialty silicon.
•
SiPh and CPO allow for the integration of fiberoptic interconnects both within a package and within the server architecture to reduce power consumption, heat generation and improve performance.  Amkor has supported previous generations of SiPh packaging needs and is aligned with the market to support its future needs, through chip on wafer, chip on chip and other advanced packaging solutions.  
•
SWIFT, also known as high-density fan-out, can either replace the laminate substrate with a thinner structure or reduce the complexity of the substrate by housing the dense interconnects in the SWIFT structure, allowing for a less expensive substrate that provides a high level of performance with a balanced cost structure.  SWIFT solutions enable high performance in a compact form factor that combines tiled processors, memory, I/O (input/output) die and other peripheral ICs.
Mainstream Products
Our Mainstream Products use wirebond interconnect technology to connect a die to a leadframe or substrate package carrier and include leadframe packages, substrate-based wirebond packages and micro-electro-mechanical systems (“MEMS”) packages.
Leadframe Packages:
  Leadframe packages use wirebond or flip chip technology to connect a die to a leadframe package carrier.  Leadframe packages are used in many electronic devices and remain the most practical and cost-effective solution for many low to medium pin count analog and mixed signal applications.
Traditional leadframe packages support a wide variety of device types and applications.  Two of our most popular traditional leadframe package types are small outline IC and quad flat package, commonly known as “dual” and “quad” products, respectively, based upon the number of sides from which the leads extend.  The traditional leadframe package family has evolved from “through hole design,” where the leads are plugged into holes on the circuit board to “surface mount design,” where the leads are soldered to the surface of the circuit board.  We offer a wide range of lead counts and body sizes to satisfy variations in the size of customers’ semiconductor devices.
Through a process of continuous engineering and customization, we have designed several leadframe package types that are thinner and smaller than traditional leadframe packages and can accommodate more leads on the perimeter of the package.  These leadframe packages typically have superior thermal and electrical characteristics, which allow them to dissipate heat generated by high-powered semiconductor devices while providing enhanced electrical connectivity.  We are developing increasingly smaller versions of these packages to keep pace with continually shrinking semiconductor device sizes and demand for miniaturization of portable electronic products.  One of our more successful leadframe package offerings is the 
Micro
LeadFrame family of quad flat no lead packages.  These packages offer cost effective, miniaturized solutions for multiple analog power and signal chain applications.

Table of Contents
Power discrete devices use a leadframe as the package carrier and primarily use wirebond interconnect technology.  However, power applications that require improved thermal and electrical performance will use packaging with copper clip interconnect technology that creates multi die power modules with wafers from silicon carbide and other wide band gap materials.
Substrate-based Wirebond Packages
:  Substrate-based wirebond packages use wirebond technology to connect a die to a substrate.  Some of our packages in this category include stacked CSP, wirebond ball grid array packages and plastic ball grid array (“PBGA”) packages.
Stacked CSP technology enables the stacking of a wide range of different semiconductor devices to deliver high levels of silicon integration and area efficiency.  Stacked CSP utilizes high density thin core substrates and advanced materials, along with leading-edge wafer thinning, die attach and molding capabilities, to stack multiple die on a substrate.  Stacked CSP is ideal for memory and mixed signal applications.
Wirebond ball grid array packages offer a broad selection of ball array pitches, ball counts and body sizes, single and multi-die layouts, stacked die and passive component integration together with thermal management solutions.  They are applicable for a wide range of semiconductors requiring a smaller package size than conventional PBGAs or leadframe packages.
PBGA packages are used in applications requiring higher pin count than leadframe packages, but typically have lower pin counts than flip chip.  PBGA packages are designed for low inductance, improved thermal operation and enhanced surface-mount technology ability.  Custom performance enhancements, like ground and power planes, are also available.
Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems Packages
:  MEMS are miniaturized mechanical and electro-mechanical devices that can sense and provide information about the physical world and sometimes trigger a response.  Examples of MEMS devices include microphones, accelerometers, airbag deployment sensors, gyrometers, magnetometers and humidity, temperature and pressure sensors.  We also specialize in sensor fusion products which utilize our cavity MEMS platform and combine multiple sensors into a single package.  MEMS packages leverage our expertise in wafer thinning, die stacking, wirebonding and flip chip interconnect to deliver sophisticated products with a very small form factor.  
Advanced System-in-Package Modules
Advanced SiP modules combine multiple semiconductor and other electronic components with different functionalities into a single package.  These modules use wirebond, flip chip or wafer-level interconnect technologies.  Components can include ICs, passive devices (inductors, capacitors, resistors, filters and diplexers), antennas and mechanical parts.
The increasing demand for miniaturization and higher functionality at competitive cost is driving the adoption of advanced SiP in new products.  Advanced SiP modules are used for many applications such as radio frequency (“RF”) and front-end modules, basebands, connectivity, fingerprint sensors, display and touch screen drivers, sensors and MEMS, NAND memory and solid state drives.  Advanced SiP modules are found in many products including smartphones and tablets, automobiles, IoT wearables, high-performance gaming systems, computers and network systems. 
In 2024, 2023 and 2022, we had net sales of approximately $3,085 million, $2,955 million and $2,930 million, respectively, from our advanced SiP modules, which are mostly included in Advanced Products, depending upon the interconnect technology used in the module. 
Test Services
Our Test Services complement our wafer and packaging services across our Advanced and Mainstream Products.

Our test services offer customers the cycle time and cost advantages of co-located turn-key services.  Our test services are used as both an interim step or as the final testing step to ensure screening and rejection of defects, performance grading and overall outgoing quality and reliability.  Interim testing eliminates the manufacturing costs of assembling the defective chips.  Below is a description of our test services: 
Wafer Level Test:

Wafer level test is a manufacturing step performed while a wafer is still in its full form and before being singulated for further package processing.  
10
Table of Contents
Package Level Test:

Package level test is performed on a product or products that have been assembled in a package.

Burn-In Test: 
Burn-in test is a process in which components of a system are exercised, monitored and measured in extreme operational conditions such as high temperature, voltage and frequency over time.

The purpose of the environmental and operational stress conditions of burn-in testing is to accelerate and screen early life failures and estimate and monitor long-term degradation and ultimate lifetime.

System Level Test:

System level test identifies defective SiP products that may not otherwise be screened by traditional wafer level, package level or burn-in testing.  As advanced packaging proliferates and the integration of more individual components into a SiP grows, system level testing becomes more important.

Test Development Services:

Prior to mass production, an integrated manufacturing ready test solution must be developed and deployed.

Amkor’s test development services offer both co-development and full development of complete test software and hardware solutions to our customers.

These services also enable early engagement with our customers in the product design phases for maximum compatibility with manufacturing.

Our test development teams are experienced in a full suite of test engineering disciplines for Memory, Power, RF, Mixed Signal, Analog and digital test solution development.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
We believe that technology development is one of the keys to success in the semiconductor packaging and test industry.  Our research efforts focus on developing new packaging solutions and test services, as well as improving the efficiency and capabilities of our existing production processes.  By concentrating our research and development on our customers’ needs for innovative packaging solutions for increased performance, higher density, smaller size and lower cost, we gain opportunities to enter markets early and compete for new business.
A significant area of focus is on integrated multi-die solutions, including 2.5D, SWIFT and S-Connect.  These multi-chip modules and high-density WLFO solutions enable package level integration of different types and levels of silicon technologies for high performance computing, networking and data center applications.  This is accomplished by combining processors and other chiplets into one packaged module.  Through die partitioning and heterogeneous integration, these modules provide higher functionality at lower total product cost.  
Another important priority is the development of wafer-level and panel-level packages for 2D and 3D implementations.  These wafer-level chip-scale packages and WLFO packages are increasingly the preferred package type for many applications in IoT and mobile devices, including processors, power management integrated circuits (“PMICs”), display drivers and antenna package products.  Our development of Panel Level Fan Out (“PLFO”) technology will permit higher economies of scale for fan-out package devices manufactured on a panel versus wafer basis.  
Another key area is developing highly integrated SiP modules, such as DSMBGA or double-sided molded land grid array packages, to reduce material and processing costs and minimize form factor for wearables and mobile devices.  
We are also developing new applications for the automotive market using existing and new package technologies as higher performance computing, energy efficiency, power distribution and sensor content are used to support new 
11
Table of Contents
automotive features including ADAS, infotainment, optical sensors and electric vehicles.  In addition, we are developing high power modules involving SiC-based devices.
Our research and development employees are based in Korea, Portugal, the United States and other locations in Asia.  In 2024, 2023 and 2022, we incurred $163.0 million, $177.5 million and $149.4 million, respectively, of research and development expense. 
SALES AND MARKETING
Our sales offices are located throughout Asia, Europe and the United States.  Our support personnel manage and promote our packaging and test services and provide key customer and technical support.  To provide comprehensive sales and customer service, we typically assign our customers a direct support team consisting of a sales manager, assembly and test technical program managers and both field and factory customer support representatives.  We also support our largest multinational customers from multiple office locations to ensure that we are aligned with their global operational and business requirements.
Our direct support teams are further supported by an extended staff of product, process, quality and reliability engineers, as well as marketing and advertising specialists, information systems technicians and factory personnel.  Together, these direct and extended support teams deliver an array of services to our customers. 
SEASONALITY
Our sales have generally been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half due to consumer buying patterns in the U.S., Europe and Asia and the timing of flagship mobile device launches.  In addition, semiconductor companies generally reduce their production during the holidays at the end of December, which generally results in a decrease in packaging and test services during the first quarter.  General economic conditions, changes in our product mix or overall demand in any of our end markets can impact our seasonality.
CUSTOMERS
Our customers include many of the largest semiconductor companies in the world.  Our ten largest customers accounted for 72% of our net sales in 2024.  Direct sales to Apple and Qualcomm accounted for 30.8% and 10.2% of our net sales, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Our materials are used primarily for packaging activities.  Our packaging operations depend upon obtaining adequate supplies of materials on a timely basis.  The principal materials used in our packaging process are laminate substrates, ICs, capacitors, leadframes and gold wire.  The silicon wafer is generally consigned from our customer.  We generally do not take ownership of the customer consigned wafer, and title and risk of loss remains with the customer for these materials.  Test materials constitute a very small portion of our total test cost.  Generally, we purchase materials based on Amkor’s commitments to customer forecasts, and our customers are generally responsible for any unused materials we purchase based on such commitments. 
We obtain the materials required for packaging services from various suppliers and source most of our materials, including critical materials such as leadframes, laminate substrates and gold wire, from a limited group of suppliers.  We work closely with our primary material suppliers to ensure consistent quality, availability and timely delivery.  We also negotiate worldwide pricing agreements with our major suppliers to take advantage of the scale of our operations.
Equipment
Our ability to meet the changing demand from our customers for manufacturing capacity depends upon obtaining packaging and test equipment in a timely manner.  We work closely with our main equipment suppliers to coordinate the ordering and delivery of equipment to meet our expected capacity needs.
The primary types of equipment used in providing our packaging services are wirebonders, die bonders, chip shooters and die attach.  In addition, we maintain a variety of other packaging equipment, including mold, singulation, ball attach

and wafer backgrind, along with numerous other types of manufacturing equipment.  A substantial portion of our packaging equipment base can generally be used and adapted to support the manufacture of many of our packages.
We also purchase wafer bumping equipment to facilitate our flip chip and wafer level packaging services such as 2.5D and HDFO, which is used for HPC and artificial intelligence systems.  Wafer bumping equipment includes sputter and spin coaters, electroplating equipment, reflow ovens and other types of equipment.  This equipment tends to have longer lead times for delivery and installation than other packaging equipment and is sold in relatively larger increments of capacity.
The primary equipment used in the testing process includes testers, handlers and probers.  Handlers are used to transfer individual or small groups of packaged ICs to a tester.  Test equipment is generally a more capital-intensive activity than packaging, and test equipment tends to have longer delivery lead times than most types of packaging equipment.  We focus our capital expenditures on standardized tester platforms to maximize test equipment utilization where possible.  In some cases, our customers will consign test equipment to us.  
GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS 
As a public company with global operations, we are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws, and our products and services are governed by a number of rules and regulations.  These regulations, which differ among jurisdictions, include financial and other external reporting disclosure rules, accounting standards and environmental, corporate governance, intellectual property, tax, trade, antitrust, employment, immigration and travel, privacy and anti-corruption laws.  Costs and accruals incurred to comply with these governmental regulations are presently not material to our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position.  Although there is no assurance that existing or future government laws applicable to our operations, services or products will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position, we do not currently anticipate material expenditures for compliance with government regulations. 
Environmental Matters
We use chemicals and materials in the semiconductor packaging process that generate byproducts such as wastewater, solid waste and flue gas.  For example, water used for rinsing or cooling wafers being sawed or used in the etching or solder deposition process produces wastewater.  Scrap from metal lead-frame or substrate processing or excessive molding resin produces solid waste.  Emissions from solvents used for coating produce flue gases.  In addition to byproducts, semiconductor packages have historically contained lead, a naturally occurring element that can be toxic.  The use of lead in our packages has decreased over time due to the use of lead-free alternatives.  The use and storage of chemicals and materials are subject to various laws and regulations governing waste disposal, water discharge, emissions into the atmosphere and employee health and safety.  We make continuous efforts to comply with these environmental laws and regulations, including environmental management systems, safety training for employees and pollution control at our factories.
In the future, we may be subject to changes to existing environmental regulations or new green initiatives required by our customers, investors, governments or other stakeholders.  We do not believe that capital expenditures or other costs attributable to compliance with environmental laws and regulations or green initiatives will have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 
COMPETITION
The outsourced semiconductor packaging and test market is highly competitive, geopolitical trade tensions have increased competition from Chinese firms supporting a China-for-China supply chain.  We face competition from established packaging and test service providers primarily located in Asia, including ASE Technology, JCET Group and Powertech Technology.
Additionally, we compete with contract foundries, such as TSMC, and electronic manufacturing service providers or contract electronics manufacturers, including Universal Scientific Industrial and Luxshare, which offer certain types of advanced packaging.  Our IDM customers also evaluate our services and scale against their own in-house capabilities.  
The key competitive factors in the outsourced semiconductor packaging and test services market are:

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We maintain an active program to protect and derive value from our investment in technology and the associated intellectual property rights.  Intellectual property rights that apply to our various products and services include patents, copyrights, trade secrets and trademarks.  We have filed and obtained a number of patents in the U.S. and other countries, and their durations vary depending on the jurisdiction in which each patent is filed.  Although our patents are an important element of our intellectual property strategy, we are not materially dependent on any one patent or any one technology.  We expect to continue to file patent applications when appropriate to protect our proprietary technologies, but we cannot provide assurances that we will receive patents from pending or future applications.  In addition, any patents we obtain could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented and may not provide meaningful protection or other commercial advantage to us.  Nonetheless, we believe that our patents afford an important means of protection for our technologies.  Further, to distinguish our products from our competitors’ products, we have obtained certain trademarks and service marks and may promote our particular brands through advertising and other marketing techniques.
We also protect and maintain the confidentiality of certain information about our processes, products and strategies which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage.  We have ongoing programs designed to maintain the confidentiality of such information.  As part of these efforts, all employees who have access to Amkor’s information systems are required to participate in cybersecurity training within the first 15 days of employment, after which recurring mandatory training is required on an annual basis.  
HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
Amkor believes that its future success is highly dependent upon our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees.  As part of our effort to attract and motivate employees, Amkor is committed to providing competitive and comprehensive benefits that are designed to enable our employees and their families to live healthier and more secure lives.  Additionally, Amkor has implemented various retention programs to incentivize and retain high-performing employees.  We regularly evaluate such retention programs and our compensation practices generally to ensure they remain competitive and are aligned with local market practices.  We look to promote our management-level employees from within Amkor, and we believe that we have been successful in this effort.  Factory locations also maintain training and development programs that enable the continued learning and growth of our employees, and senior management regularly meets to share and implement best practices among our various facilities. 
Amkor also uses human capital initiatives to support our broad geographic footprint.  For career development and advancement, we may provide employees with the opportunity to move between factories, often in support of new factories or the introduction of new packaging offerings.  We believe that these initiatives are efficient for training new local employees and allow existing employees to continue to develop in their careers.
We believe that our efforts to motivate, retain and support the growth of qualified employees is reflected in the long average tenure of many of our key employees.  
As of December 31, 2024, Amkor employed 28,300 employees, of whom approximately 96%, 3% and 1% resided in the Asia-Pacific region, Europe and the United States, respectively.  Our global workforce spans 12 countries, reflecting various cultures, backgrounds, ages, genders and ethnicities.  Our employees in France, Germany, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and the United States are not represented by any union.  Certain employees at our factories in China, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Portugal and Vietnam are members of a union, and we operate subject to collective bargaining agreements that we have entered into with these unions.  We believe that our relations with our employees are good, and we have not experienced a work stoppage in any of our factories.
