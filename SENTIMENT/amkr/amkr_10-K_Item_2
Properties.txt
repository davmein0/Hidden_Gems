Land is leased.
(2)
As a result of foreign ownership restrictions in the Philippines, the land is leased.  A portion of the land we lease is owned by realty companies in which we own a 40% interest.
During 2024, we acquired land for the Arizona Facility.  We anticipate beginning construction of the new facility in the second half of 2025.
Our executive offices, which are leased, are located in Tempe, Arizona and Singapore.  We believe that our existing properties are in good condition and suitable for the conduct of our business and that the productive capacity of such properties is substantially being utilized or we have plans to utilize it.
