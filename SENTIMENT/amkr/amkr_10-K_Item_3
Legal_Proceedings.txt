    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
This section includes comparisons of certain 2024 financial information to the same information for 2023.  For discussion of 2023 results in comparison with 2022 results refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 16, 2024. 
Overview
Amkor is the world’s largest US headquartered OSAT (outsourced semiconductor assembly and test) service provider.  We are an industry leader in developing and commercializing advanced packaging and test technologies, which we believe provide substantial value to our customers.  Our primary financial objective is profitable sales growth.  To achieve this goal, we are focused on leveraging our leadership position in services for advanced technologies, providing our customers with a geographically diverse manufacturing footprint, growing within the industry secular growth markets of HPC, automotive, IoT and mobile communications, selectively growing our scale and scope through strategic investments and optimizing utilization of existing assets.  
We believe that demand for advanced packaging services will continue to grow as our customers and leading electronics OEMs strive for smaller device geometries, higher levels of integration and performance and lower power consumption.  We intend to continue to leverage our investments in advanced technology to meet the demand for these services in high growth markets.
High performance computing supporting artificial intelligence and increasing demand for improved networking speed and storage within data centers, cloud computing, PCs and laptops, are driving demand for more semiconductors and advanced packaging in the computing end market.  Increasing semiconductor content in automobiles is driving increased demand for advanced packaging to enable the proliferation of safety features such as ADAS and radar and digital cockpit features such as infotainment displays and telematics.  The IoT wearables within our consumer end market are evolving in multiple applications, such as hearables, watches and augmented reality and virtual reality devices.

Integration of multiple functions into small form factors, such as processors, sensors and connectivity devices, relies on innovation in advanced packaging.  Within our communications end market, we have a strong position across multiple device functionalities within premium and high tier smartphones.  We are collaborating with industry leaders as smartphones transition to include artificial intelligence and drive semiconductor growth through integration of a broad range of applications, enhanced features and higher performance requirements to support increased data processing.  
Our broad geographic footprint, including our manufacturing presence in multiple countries across Asia, in Portugal and our headquarters in the United States, is a key differentiator and positions us well to support evolving global supply chains, including initiatives to regionalize supply chains.  We began delivering advanced packages from the Vietnam Facility in the third quarter of 2024.  In addition, we are progressing plans to build an advanced packaging and test facility in Arizona and were awarded up to $407 million in direct funding by Commerce pursuant to the CHIPS Act to support the facility, conditioned on, among other things, the achievement of certain construction and production milestones.  We acquired the land for the Arizona Facility in 2024 and expect to begin construction in the second half of 2025.  We believe our broad geographic footprint provides customers with multiple options to mitigate risk and diversify their supply chains.  
Another key factor in our success is the optimization of asset utilization.  We build and utilize manufacturing lines which support multiple customers, and we increase factory utilization through sophisticated planning processes and intensive efficiency improvement activities.
Our customers include most of the world’s largest semiconductor companies, and over the last five decades we have developed long-standing relationships with many of these companies.  We believe that our production excellence, including high quality, reliability and predictability, has been a key factor in our success in attracting and retaining customers.  
As a supplier in the semiconductor industry, our business is cyclical and impacted by broad economic factors.  Historical trends indicate there has been a strong correlation between worldwide gross domestic product levels, consumer spending and semiconductor industry cycles.  The semiconductor industry has experienced significant and sometimes prolonged 
37
Table of Contents
cyclical upturns and downturns in the past.  We cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any correction, economic slowdown, recession or subsequent economic recovery. 
We operate in a capital-intensive industry.  Servicing our current and future customers requires that we incur significant operating expenses and continue to make significant capital expenditures, which are generally made in advance of expected revenues and without firm customer commitments.  We fund our operations, including capital expenditures and debt service requirements, with cash flows from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, borrowings under available credit facilities and proceeds from any additional financing.  Maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity is important to our business and depends on, among other considerations, the performance of our business, our capital expenditure levels, our ability to repay debt out of our operating cash flows or proceeds from debt or equity financings and our investment strategy.  As of December 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1,133.6 million and $513.0 million, respectively. 
Our net sales, gross profit, operating income, cash flows, liquidity and capital resources have historically fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter due to many factors, including the seasonality of our business, the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and other factors discussed in Part 1, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.  We will continue to make prudent investments, and we will closely manage capacity expansion and control costs in response to any changes in market conditions.
2024 Financial Summary
Our net sales decreased $185.4 million or 2.9% to $6,317.7 million in 2024 from $6,503.1 million in 2023.  The decrease was primarily due to lower sales in our automotive and industrial and communications end markets, partially offset by growth in the computing and consumer end markets.
Gross margin increased to 14.8% in 2024 compared to 14.5% in 2023.  The increase was primarily due to the extension of the estimated useful life of our test equipment from five years to seven years and net favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements, offset by the decrease in net sales and resulting lower factory utilization.
Operating income margin decreased to 6.9% in 2024 from 7.2% in 2023.  The decrease in our operating income margin was primarily due to increased employee compensation costs and costs incurred during start-up at the Vietnam Facility, partially offset by the increase in our gross margin discussed above and a reduction in bad debt expense.
In 2024, our capital expenditures totaled $743.8 million, or 11.8% of net sales, compared to $749.5 million, or 11.5% of net sales in 2023.  Our spending was primarily focused on investments in advanced packaging and test equipment. 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,088.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $1,270.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.  This decrease was primarily due to changes in working capital and lower operating profits.   
In November 2024, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.08269 per share, a 5% increase from the rate set in November 2023.  The Board of Directors also approved a special cash dividend of $0.40546 per share.  In 2024, we paid total cash dividends of $178.6 million.

The $185.4 million decrease in net sales in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to lower sales in our automotive and industrial and communications end markets, partially offset by growth in the computing and consumer end markets.  The automotive and industrial end market decreased 16% in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by elevated customer inventories and weaker demand.  The communications end market decreased 7% in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to lower supported content mix in premium tier smartphones.  The computing and consumer end markets grew 16% and 10%, respectively, in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by strong demand for ARM-based PCs, AI devices and IoT wearables.

Our cost of sales consists principally of materials, labor, depreciation and manufacturing overhead.  Since a substantial portion of the costs at our factories is fixed, there tends to be a strong relationship between our revenue levels and gross margin.  Accordingly, relatively modest increases or decreases in revenue can have a significant effect on margin and on labor and other manufacturing costs as a percentage of revenue, depending on product mix, utilization, foreign currency exchange rate movements and seasonality.  We have expanded our business in advanced packaging, which tends to have higher material costs than our other products.  As we continue to increase production of these higher material cost products, there could be an impact on our profitability, depending on overall utilization.
While gross profit decreased for 2024 compared to 2023, gross margin increased primarily due to the extension of the estimated useful life of our test equipment from five years to seven years and net favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements, offset by the decrease in net sales and resulting lower factory utilization.

Research and development activities are focused on developing new packaging and test services and improving the efficiency and capabilities of our existing production processes.  The costs related to our technology and product development projects are included in research and development expense until the project moves into production.  Once production begins, the costs relating to production become part of the cost of sales, including ongoing depreciation for the equipment previously held for research and development activities.  
Research and development expenses decreased in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to the utilization mix of assets shared with manufacturing and projects moving into production, partially offset by new development projects in packaging technologies.

Income tax expense, which includes foreign withholding taxes and minimum taxes, reflects the applicable tax rates in effect in the various countries where our income is earned and is subject to volatility depending on the relative mix of earnings in each location. 
The effective tax rate is below the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to lower tax rates applicable to our operations in some foreign jurisdictions where we earn income.  The effective tax rate in 2022 includes a $17.8 million tax benefit from the recognition of deferred tax assets we expect to utilize in future years.  
During 2024, 2023 and 2022, our subsidiaries in Korea and Singapore operated under various conditional reduced tax rates.  Beginning in 2024, our subsidiary in Vietnam also operated under a conditional reduced tax rate.  As these conditional reduced tax rates expire, income earned in these jurisdictions will be subject to higher statutory income tax rates, which may cause our effective tax rate to increase.  In addition, the conditional reduced tax rates granted to certain operations are expected to be adversely impacted by the enactment of the Pillar Two Model Rules effective in 2025.  We believe the short-term impact will result in an increase to the overall effective tax rate of approximately 2 to 3 percentage points, before any discrete tax items, depending on the amount and relative mix of earnings in each location, among other factors.  
See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information about our income tax expense.
Liquidity 
We assess our liquidity based on our current expectations regarding sales and operating expenses, capital spending, dividend payments, stock and debt repurchases, debt service requirements, lease obligations and other funding needs.  Based on this assessment, we believe that our cash flow from operating activities, together with existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and availability under our credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividend payments, debt service, debt repurchases and other financial requirements for at least the next 12 months.  
Our liquidity is affected by, among other factors, volatility in the global economy and credit markets, the performance of our business, our capital expenditure levels, other uses of our cash including any dividends and purchases of stock or debt under any repurchase program, any acquisitions, joint ventures or other investments and our ability to either repay debt out of operating cash flow or refinance it at or prior to maturity with the proceeds from debt or equity offerings.  There can be no assurance that we will generate the necessary net income or operating cash flows, or be able to borrow sufficient funds, to meet the funding needs of our business beyond the next 12 months due to a variety of factors, including the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and other factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
Our primary source of cash and the source of funds for our operations are cash flows from operations, current cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, borrowings under available credit facilities and proceeds from any additional debt or equity financings.  Please refer to Note 6 and Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information on our investments and borrowings, respectively.
As of December 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1,646.5 million.  Included in our cash and short-term investments balances as of December 31, 2024, is $1,407.9 million held offshore by our foreign subsidiaries.  We have the ability to access cash held offshore by our foreign subsidiaries primarily through the repayment of intercompany debt obligations.  If we were to distribute this offshore cash to the United States as dividends 
41
Table of Contents
from our foreign subsidiaries, the dividends generally would not be subject to U.S. federal income tax, but the distributions may be subject to foreign withholding and state income taxes.  For the year ended December 31, 2024, we estimate that repatriation of this foreign cash and short-term investments would generate withholding taxes and state income taxes of approximately $48 million.  
For certain accounts receivable, we use non-recourse factoring arrangements with third party financial institutions to manage our working capital and cash flows.  Under these arrangements, we sell receivables to a financial institution for cash at a discount to the face amount.  Available capacity under these arrangements is dependent on the level of our trade accounts receivable eligible to be sold, the financial institutions’ willingness to purchase such receivables and the limits provided by the financial institutions.  These factoring arrangements can be reduced or eliminated at any time due to market conditions and changes in the creditworthiness of customers.  For the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we sold accounts receivable totaling $158.6 million and $253.9 million, net of discounts and fees of $0.4 million and $1.3 million, respectively.
We operate in a capital-intensive industry.  Servicing our current and future customers may require that we incur significant operating expenses and make significant investments in equipment and facilities, which are generally made in advance of the related revenues and without firm customer commitments. 
In December 2024, we signed a Direct Funding Agreement with the U.S. Department of Commerce for the award of up to $407 million in government incentives pursuant to the CHIPS Act, and no funds have been received to date.  The award requires us to achieve construction and production milestones over the next several years.  In addition, we receive a 25% investment tax credit on qualified investments in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing under the CHIPS Act.  For additional information, please refer to Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
The maximum borrowing capacity under our $600.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (“2022 Singapore Revolver”) is limited to a base amount equal to the lesser of: (1) $600.0 million; or (2) $250.0 million plus a variable amount equal to 37.5% of our consolidated accounts receivable balance.  As of December 31, 2024, we had availability of $600.0 million.  As of December 31, 2024, our foreign subsidiaries also had $60.0 million available to be borrowed under term loan credit facilities.  For additional information regarding the 2022 Singapore Revolver, please refer to Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.  
As of December 31, 2024, we had debt of $1,159.5 million, with $236.0 million payable within 12 months.  As of December 31, 2024, the interest payment obligations, based on stated coupon rates for fixed rate debt and interest rates applicable at December 31, 2024 for variable rate debt, were $134.0 million during the remaining term of the debt.  Interest payment obligations payable within 12 months is $49.9 million.  We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of December 31, 2024, and we expect to remain in compliance with these covenants for at least the next 12 months.  For additional information regarding our debt arrangements, please refer to Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 
Certain of our debt agreements have restrictions on dividend payments and the repurchase of stock and subordinated securities.  These restrictions are determined in part by our covenant compliance and on calculations based upon cumulative net income and do not currently have a material impact on our ability to make dividend payments or stock repurchases.  
The debt of Amkor Technology, Inc. is structurally subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future debt and other liabilities of our subsidiaries.  From time to time, Amkor Technology, Inc., Amkor Technology Taiwan Ltd. (“ATT”), Amkor Advanced Technology Taiwan, Inc. (“AATT”) and Amkor Technology Singapore Holding Pte. Ltd. (“ATSH”) guarantee certain debt of our subsidiaries.
In order to reduce our debt and future cash interest payments, we may from time to time repurchase or redeem our outstanding senior notes for cash or exchange shares of our common stock for our outstanding senior notes.  Any such transaction may be made in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, and would be subject to the terms of our indentures and other debt agreements, market conditions and other factors.
We lease certain machinery and equipment, office space and manufacturing facilities.  As of December 31, 2024, our total remaining operating lease obligations and finance lease obligations were $98.5 million and $204.4 million, 
42
Table of Contents
respectively, with $30.9 million and $65.7 million payable within 12 months, respectively.  The lease obligations represent our future minimum lease payments including interest payments.  For additional information regarding our leases, please refer to Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 
We had off-balance sheet purchase obligations for capital expenditures, long-term supply contracts and other contractual commitments.  As of December 31, 2024, the purchase obligations were $476.8 million, with $425.1 million payable within 12 months.
Capital Returns
In November 2022, we announced our intention to return 40 percent to 50 percent of cumulative free cash flow generated over time, beginning 2022.  This return may be in the form of dividends and stock repurchases, subject to a variety of factors, including strategic investments, other capital allocation priorities and Board of Directors’ approval.
In 2024, we paid total cash dividends of $178.6 million, and we currently anticipate that we will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future.  However, the payment, amount and timing of future dividends remain within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, debt restrictions and other factors.
Capital Resources
We make significant capital expenditures in order to service the demand of our customers.  In 2024, our capital expenditures totaled $743.8 million or approximately 11.8% of net sales, which are primarily focused on investments in advanced packaging and test equipment.
We expect that our 2025 capital expenditures will be approximately $850 million, approximately 5% to 10% of which we expect to spend on the construction of the Arizona Facility.  Ultimately, the amount of our 2025 capital expenditures will depend on several factors including, among others, the timing and implementation of any capital projects under review, including the commencement of construction for the Arizona Facility, the performance of our business, economic and market conditions, the cash needs and investment opportunities for the business, the need for additional capacity to service anticipated customer demand, equipment lead times and the availability of cash flows from operations or financing.  The primary sources of funds for our capital expenditures are cash flows from operations, current cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, borrowings under available credit facilities and proceeds from any additional debt or equity financings.  Please refer to Note 6 and Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information on our investments and borrowings, respectively.

In addition, we are subject to risks associated with our capital expenditures, including those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the caption “We make substantial investments in equipment and facilities to support the demand of our customers, which may materially and adversely affect our business if the demand of our customers does not develop as we expect or is adversely affected.”

Operating activities:
  Our cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 decreased by $181.2 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to changes in working capital and lower operating profits.  
Investing activities:
  Our cash flow used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 decreased by $151.6 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to lower net payments for short-term investment activity.  
Financing activities:
  The net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was primarily due to the payments of our dividends, payments of finance lease obligations and net debt repayments.  
We provide the following supplemental data to assist our investors and analysts in understanding our liquidity and capital resources.  We define “free cash flow” as net cash provided by operating activities less payments for property, plant and equipment, plus proceeds from the sale of, insurance recovery for and grants for property, plant and equipment, if applicable.  Free cash flow is not defined by U.S. GAAP.  We believe free cash flow to be relevant and useful information to our investors because it provides them with additional information in assessing our liquidity, capital resources and financial operating results.  Our management uses free cash flow in evaluating our liquidity, our ability to service debt, our ability to fund capital expenditures and our ability to pay dividends and the amount of dividends to be paid.  However, free cash flow has certain limitations, including that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures since other, non-discretionary expenditures, such as mandatory debt service, are not deducted from the measure.  The amount of mandatory versus discretionary expenditures can vary significantly between periods.  This measure should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, other measures of liquidity or financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, such as net cash provided by operating activities.  Furthermore, our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

Contingencies, Indemnifications and Guarantees
Please refer to Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a discussion of contingencies related to litigation and other legal matters. 
Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates
We have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations.  A summary of our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements appears in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.  Our preparation of this Form 10-K requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates, including the impact of any deterioration in the global business and economic environment.
We believe the following critical accounting estimates and policies, which have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Table of Contents
Revenue Recognition.
  We recognize revenue, net of sales, use, value-added and other similar taxes, as a performance obligation is satisfied in an amount reflecting the consideration to which we expect to be entitled.  We apply a five-step approach in determining the amount and timing of revenue to be recognized: (1) identifying the contract with a customer; (2) identifying the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determining the transaction price; (4) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognizing revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied.  Substantially all of our revenue is recognized as services are rendered. 
Our packaging and test services are our performance obligations to our customers.  Our packaging services include wafer bump, probe and assembly.  We provide packaging and test services to our customers either individually or as part of a combined offering.  In a combined offering, we account for the individual services separately if they are determined to be distinct.  We determine a service to be distinct if it is separately identifiable from other services in the combined offering and if a customer can benefit from the unique service on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer.
The consideration, including variable consideration, is allocated between the distinct services in a combined offering based upon the stand-alone selling prices of the individual services.  Our services involve a high degree of specialization which are unique based on the design and purpose of the customer’s wafers.  Accordingly, our negotiated pricing reflects the customized nature of our services and represents a customer-specific stand-alone selling price.  We recognize revenue as services are rendered, which generally occurs over the course of two to three weeks.  Services are generally billed at completion of each individual packaging or test service or in some instances at the completion of all services in a combined offering. 
We recognize revenue over time as services are rendered because our services create or enhance the customer’s wafer.  We utilize an input method (cost incurred plus estimated margin) to determine the amount of revenue to recognize for in-process, but incomplete, customer orders at a reporting date.  During the period of providing our services, we generally do not control or take ownership of customers’ wafers, nor do we include the cost of the wafer in our cost calculations.  We believe that a cost-based input method is the most appropriate manner to measure how we satisfy our performance obligations to customers because the effort and costs incurred to package and/or test customer wafers are not linear over the duration of these services.
Shipping and handling costs are accounted for as a cost to fulfill our performance obligations to customers.  Accordingly, we record customer payments of shipping and handling costs as a component of net sales, and the costs incurred for shipping and handling are then charged to cost of sales.  
Income Taxes.
  We operate in and file income tax returns in various U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions which are subject to examination by tax authorities.  The tax returns for years where the statute of limitations remains open in all jurisdictions in which we do business are subject to change upon examination.  We believe that we have estimated and provided adequate accruals for potential additional taxes and related interest expense that may ultimately result from such examinations.  We believe that any additional taxes or related interest over the amounts accrued will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  However, resolution of these matters involves uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that the outcomes will be favorable.  In addition, changes in the mix of income from our foreign subsidiaries, expiration of conditional reduced tax rates or changes in tax laws or regulations could result in increased tax expense and effective tax rates in the future.
Additionally, we monitor on an ongoing basis our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets and whether there is a need for a related valuation allowance.  In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets in the jurisdictions from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and results of recent operations.  With the exception of a certain foreign jurisdiction and select U.S. and foreign carryforwards, we consider it more likely than not that we will have sufficient taxable income to allow us to realize these deferred tax assets.  However, in the event taxable income falls short of current expectations, we may need to establish a valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets.  We have valuation allowances on certain U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards expected to expire unused and on select deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions.  Such valuation allowances are released as the related tax benefits are realized or when sufficient evidence exists to conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized.

Valuation of Inventory.
  We order raw materials based on customers’ forecasted demand.  If our customers change their forecasted requirements and we are unable to cancel our raw materials order, or if our vendors require that we order a minimum quantity that exceeds the current forecasted demand, we will experience a build-up in raw material inventory.  We will either seek to recover the cost of the materials from our customers or utilize the inventory in production.  However, we may not be successful in recovering the cost from our customers or be able to use the inventory in production and, accordingly, if we believe that it is probable that we will not be able to recover such costs, we reduce the carrying value of our inventory.  Additionally, we reduce the carrying value of our inventories by the cost of inventory we estimate is excess and obsolete based on the age of our inventories.  When a determination is made that the inventory will not be utilized in production or is not saleable, it is written off.  The forecast of demand and the evaluation of inventory recoverability require estimates and judgment.  Although we make an effort to ensure forecasted demand and estimates of inventory are accurate, any unanticipated changes could have a material effect on our financial condition and result of operations. 
Inventories consist of raw materials and purchased components and are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value.  Cost is principally determined by standard cost or the weighted moving average method, both of which approximate actual cost.  For inventory valued using the standard cost method, we review and set our standard costs as needed, but at a minimum on a quarterly basis.
Valuation of Long-lived Assets.
  We review long-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment and goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  Factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following:
•
significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results;
•
significant changes in the manner of our use of the asset;
•
significant negative industry or economic trends; and
•
our market capitalization relative to net book value.
Recoverability of a long-lived asset group to be held and used in operations is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group.  If such asset group is considered to be impaired, the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value.  Long-lived assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less the costs of disposal.  
We review goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist.  Impairment losses are recorded when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value.

Item 7A.
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
Market Risk Sensitivity
We are exposed to market risks, primarily related to foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.  In the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage the exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values and changes in interest rates.
Foreign Currency Risk
The U.S. dollar is our reporting and functional currency for our subsidiaries, except for our Japan operations, where the Japanese yen is the functional currency.  In order to reduce our exposure to foreign currency gains and losses, we use natural hedging techniques and forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk.
46
Table of Contents

We have foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.  We performed a sensitivity analysis of our foreign currency exposure as of December 31, 2024, to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates for all foreign denominated assets and liabilities.  Assuming that all foreign currencies appreciated 10% against the U.S. dollar and taking into account our foreign currency forward contracts, our income before taxes as of December 31, 2024 would have been approximately $11 million lower, due to the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities. 
In addition, we have foreign currency exchange rate exposure on our results of operations.  For the year ended December 31, 2024, approximately 90% of our net sales were denominated in U.S. dollars.  Our remaining net sales were principally denominated in Japanese yen.  For the year ended December 31, 2024, approximately 60% of our cost of sales and operating expenses were denominated in U.S. dollars and were largely for raw materials and costs associated with property, plant and equipment.  The remaining portion of our cost of sales and operating expenses was principally denominated in the Asian currencies where our production facilities are located and largely consisted of labor.  To the extent that the U.S. dollar weakens against these Asian-based currencies, similar foreign currency denominated income and expenses in the future will result in higher sales, higher cost of sales and operating expenses, with cost of sales and operating expenses having the greater impact on our financial results.  Similarly, our sales, cost of sales and operating expenses will decrease if the U.S. dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies.  We performed a sensitivity analysis of our foreign currency exposure as of December 31, 2024 to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates for all foreign denominated sales and operating expenses.  Assuming that all foreign currencies appreciated 10% against the U.S. dollar, our operating income for the year ended December 31, 2024 would have been approximately $148 million lower.
There are inherent limitations in the sensitivity analysis presented, primarily the assumption that foreign exchange rate movements across multiple jurisdictions would change instantaneously in an equal fashion.  As a result, the analysis is unable to reflect the potential effects of more complex market or other changes that could arise which may positively or negatively affect our results of operations.
Our Consolidated Financial Statements are impacted by changes in exchange rates at the entity where the local currency is the functional currency.  To mitigate this impact, we started to hedge certain net investment positions in foreign subsidiaries by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that are designated as hedges of net investments beginning in April 2024.  The effect of foreign exchange rate translation for these entities, inclusive of our foreign currency forward contracts, was a loss of $8.8 million and $3.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and was recognized as an adjustment to equity through other comprehensive income (loss).
Interest Rate Risk
We have interest rate risk with respect to our available-for-sale debt investments.  Our investment portfolio consists of various security types and maturities, with our portfolio primarily having maturities of one year or less.  Our primary objective with our investment portfolio is to invest available cash while preserving capital and meeting liquidity needs.  These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase.  Due to the relatively short-term nature of our investment portfolio, we believe that an immediate increase in interest rates will not have a material impact on the fair value of our available-for-sale debt investments.  For information regarding our available-for-sale debt investments, see Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
In addition, we have interest rate risk with respect to our debt.  Our fixed and variable rate debt includes foreign borrowings, revolving credit facilities and senior notes.  Changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variable rate portions of our debt portfolio.  A change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the fair value of the debt instrument but has no impact on interest expense or cash flows.  A change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but will not have a material impact on the fair value of the instrument.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Amkor Technology, Inc.
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Amkor Technology, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 appearing under Item 8 (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).  We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the COSO.  
Basis for Opinions
The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.  Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.  Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.  Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
50
Table of Contents
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.  The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Accounting for Income Taxes 
As described in Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded income tax expense of $75.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, and net deferred tax assets of $55.9 million and unrecognized tax benefits of $36.3 million as of December 31, 2024.  Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method.  Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis as well as for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.  Management monitors on an ongoing basis its ability to utilize deferred tax assets and whether there is a need for a related valuation allowance.  In evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets in the jurisdictions from which they arise, management considers all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and recent results of operations.  The Company operates in and files income tax returns in various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, which are subject to examination by tax authorities.  Years open to examination contain matters that could be subject to differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations related to the amount and/or timing of income, deductions and tax credits. 
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to accounting for income taxes is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in determining the income tax provision and other tax positions.  This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit evidence relating to income taxes.  The audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the audit evidence obtained.
51
Table of Contents
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.  These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to accounting for income taxes, including the controls addressing the completeness and accuracy of the data utilized.  These procedures also included, among others (i) testing the income tax provision calculation and underlying data, including the effective tax rate reconciliation, significant return to provision adjustments, and permanent and temporary differences, (ii) evaluating management’s assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets on a jurisdictional basis, (iii) evaluating the identification of reserves for unrecognized tax benefits and the reasonableness of the “more likely than not” determination considering the jurisdictions, court decisions, legislative actions, statute of limitations, and developments in tax examinations, and (iv) using professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of management’s judgment and estimates, including application of foreign and domestic tax laws and regulations.

Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Description of Business
Amkor is the world’s largest U.S. headquartered OSAT (outsourced semiconductor assembly and test) service provider.  Since its founding in 1968, Amkor has pioneered the outsourcing of IC packaging and test services and is a strategic manufacturing partner for the world’s leading semiconductor companies, foundries, and electronics OEMs.  Amkor provides turnkey manufacturing services for the communication, computing, automotive and industrial and consumer markets, including smartphones, data centers, artificial intelligence, electric vehicles and wearables.  Amkor’s operational base includes production facilities, research and development centers and sales and support offices located in key electronics manufacturing regions in Asia, Europe and the United States.  Amkor has built a leading position by:
•
Designing and developing innovative packaging and test technologies focused on advanced packaging solutions in high growth markets, including artificial intelligence;
•
Building expertise in high-volume manufacturing processes and developing a reputation for high quality and solid execution; 
•
Cultivating long-standing relationships with our customers and industry partners;
•
Focusing on strategic end markets that offer solid growth potential;
•
Providing a geographically diverse operating base with manufacturing facilities in multiple countries across Asia and in Europe; and
•
Developing a competitive cost structure through disciplined capital investment.
Basis of Presentation
Our Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Amkor Technology, Inc. and its subsidiaries.  Our Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the elimination of all significant inter-company accounts and transactions.  Our investments in variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary are consolidated.  We reflect the remaining portion of variable interest entities and foreign subsidiaries that are not wholly owned as noncontrolling interests.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.  On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, income taxes, inventory and long-lived assets.  These estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events, historical experience, actions that we may undertake in the future and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.  As a result, actual results could differ materially from these estimates and assumptions, including the impact of any deterioration in the global business and economic environment.
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities
We have variable interests in certain Philippine realty corporations in which we have a 
40
% ownership.  We lease land and buildings in the Philippines from these entities and we are the primary beneficiary of these arrangements.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the combined book value of the assets and liabilities associated with these Philippine realty corporations included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet were $
17.3
 million and $
0.1
 million, respectively, for each period.  The impact of consolidating these variable interest entities on our Consolidated Statements of Income was not significant, and other than our lease payments, we have not provided any significant assistance or other financial support to these variable interest entities for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022.  The creditors of the Philippine realty corporations have no recourse to our general credit.

AMKOR TECHNOLOGY, INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
Foreign Currency Translation
The U.S. dollar is the functional currency of our subsidiaries other than our Japan operations.  The foreign currency asset and liability amounts at these subsidiaries are remeasured into U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates, except for nonmonetary items which are remeasured at historical rates.  Foreign currency income and expenses are remeasured at daily exchange rates, except for expenses related to balance sheet amounts which are remeasured at historical exchange rates.  Exchange gains and losses arising from remeasurement of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are included in other (income) expense, net in the period in which they occur.
The Japanese yen is the functional currency of our Japan operations.  The asset and liability amounts of our Japan operations are translated into U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates.  Income and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars at the daily exchange rate.  The resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the stockholders’ equity section of the balance sheet.  Assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are remeasured into the functional currency prior to translation into U.S. dollars, and the resulting transaction exchange gains or losses are included in other (income) expense, net in the period in which they occur.
Risks and Concentrations
The semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change, competitive pricing pressures and cyclical market patterns.  Our financial results are affected by a wide variety of factors, including general economic conditions worldwide, economic conditions specific to the semiconductor industry, the timely implementation of new package and test technologies, the ability to safeguard patents and intellectual property in a rapidly evolving market and reliance on materials and equipment suppliers.  In addition, the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns at various times.  Our profitability and ability to generate cash from operations is principally dependent upon demand for semiconductors, the utilization of our capacity, semiconductor package mix, the average selling price of our services, our ability to manage our capital expenditures and our ability to control our costs including labor, material, overhead and financing costs. 
A significant portion of our revenues is concentrated with a small group of customers (Note 18).  Direct sales to our two largest customers accounted for 
30.8
% and 
10.2
% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2024. 

The loss of a significant customer, a business combination among customers, a reduction in orders or decrease in price from a significant customer or disruption in any of our significant strategic partnerships or other commercial arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Financial instruments, for which we are subject to credit risk, consist principally of accounts receivable and cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.  With respect to accounts receivable, we mitigate our credit risk by selling primarily to well-established companies, performing ongoing credit evaluations and making frequent contact with customers.  In addition, we may utilize non-recourse factoring when considered appropriate.  We have historically mitigated our credit risk with respect to cash and cash equivalents through diversification of our holdings into various high quality money market funds and bank deposit accounts.  Our short-term investments are principally investments in debt securities with maximum duration of twenty-four months and range from AAA to BB rated financial instruments.  Our short-term investments are primarily in corporate bonds, direct obligations of the U.S. Government or its agencies, asset-backed securities and commercial paper.  At December 31, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents were primarily maintained in various U.S. and foreign bank operating and time deposit accounts and invested in various available-for-sale debt investments.  See Note 6 for further discussion regarding our available-for-sale debt investments.
Contingencies and Litigation
We may be subject to certain legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims, as discussed in Note 17.  We accrue for a loss contingency, including legal proceedings, lawsuits, pending claims and other legal matters, when we conclude that the likelihood of a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  When the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts, and no amount in the range constitutes a better estimate than any other amount, we 
60
Table of Contents
AMKOR TECHNOLOGY, INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
accrue for the amount at the low end of the range.  We adjust our accruals from time to time as we receive additional information, but the loss we incur may be significantly greater than or less than the amount we have accrued.  We disclose loss contingencies if we believe they are material and there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred.  Attorney fees related to legal matters are expensed as incurred.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
We consider all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.  Our cash and cash equivalents are primarily maintained in various U.S. and foreign bank operating and time deposit accounts and invested in various available-for-sale debt investments.  See Note 6 for further discussion regarding our available-for-sale debt investments.
Restricted Cash
Restricted cash, non-current, mainly consists of collateral to fulfill utility requirements.
Investments
Generally, we classify our short-term investments in fixed income securities as available-for-sale debt investments.  All of our available-for-sale debt investments as of December 31, 2024 are available to fund current operations and are recorded at fair value (Note 6).  Unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale debt investments are included as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.  Realized gains and losses on our available-for-sale debt investments and declines in value judged to be an impairment are included in other (income) expense, net.  The cost of short-term investments matured or sold is based on the average cost method.
We evaluate on an ongoing basis the market conditions, trends of earnings, financial condition, credit ratings, any underlying collateral and other key measures for our short-term investments in determining if and when a decline in value below the adjusted cost of our available-for-sale debt investments is an impairment.  An impairment is considered if (i) we have the intent to sell the security, (ii) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis or (iii) we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security.  If impairment is considered on condition (i) or (ii) above, the entire difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the debt security is recognized in earnings.  If impairment is considered based on condition (iii), the amount representing credit losses will be recognized in earnings and as an allowance for credit losses.  The amount relating to all other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income.
Inventories
Inventories consist of raw materials and purchased components and are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value.  Cost is principally determined by standard cost or the weighted moving average method, both of which approximate actual cost.  We review and set our standard costs as needed, but at a minimum on a quarterly basis.  We reduce the carrying value of our inventories for the cost of inventory we estimate is excess and obsolete based on the age of our inventories.  When a determination is made that the inventory will not be utilized in production or is not saleable, it is written-off.
Other Current Assets
Other current assets consist principally of prepaid assets.

Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost.  
Depreciation is calculated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of depreciable assets which are as follows:
Buildings and improvements
10
 to 
40
 years
Machinery and equipment
2
 to 
7
 years
Software and computer equipment
3
 to 
5
 years
Furniture, fixtures and other equipment
4
 to 
10
 years
We periodically assess the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment.  Based on our assessment of test equipment and its increased interchangeability enabling broader and longer use, we extended the estimated useful lives of test equipment from 
five years
 to 
seven years
 as of January 1, 2024.  See Note 8 for further discussion of the estimated useful lives assessment.
Cost and accumulated depreciation for property retired or disposed of are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is included in earnings.  Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
We review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  Recoverability of a long-lived asset group to be held and used in operations is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group.  If such asset group is considered to be impaired, the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value.  Long-lived assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less the costs of disposal.
Grant Accounting
From time to time, we may receive grants from governmental agencies.  We recognize grants in our financial statements when there is reasonable assurance that we will comply with conditions attached to the grants and the grants will be received.  Government grants are recognized in earnings on a systematic basis over the periods in which the entity incurs costs for which the grants are intended to compensate.
In 2024, we acquired approximately 
56
 acres of land related to the Arizona Facility with a total fair value of $
36.9
 million.  In connection with this acquisition, we paid $
4.2
 million with the remaining amount obtained as a tangible non-monetary grant subject to the construction and operation of the Arizona Facility.  We initially recorded the grant as a deferred liability in other non-current liabilities, and subsequently it will be reclassified on a net basis against construction and operation costs.
In August 2022, the U.S. government enacted the CHIPS Act, which provides funding for manufacturing grants and research investments and establishes a 25% investment tax credit for certain investments in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing.  In 2024, we recorded $
1.4
 million of investment tax credits, which reduced the carrying amounts of the qualifying property, plant and equipment in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  These investment tax credits are recorded either as a reduction of current income taxes payable or as other assets.  In December 2024, Commerce awarded us up to $
407
 million in direct funding pursuant to the CHIPS Act for the Arizona Facility.  This award requires us to achieve construction and production milestones and restrict us from undertaking certain activities.  As of December 31, 2024, no funding amounts have been received.
Leases
We lease certain machinery and equipment, office space, and manufacturing facilities.  Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet, and we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  We combine lease components (e.g., fixed payments including rent, real estate taxes and 
62

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
insurance costs) with the non-lease components (e.g., common-area maintenance costs) for all asset classes.  We use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date to determine the lease liability.  Our leases have remaining lease terms ranging from less than 
one year
 to 
81
 years.  For purposes of calculating our lease liabilities, our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise those options.  Certain leases also include options or obligations to purchase the leased property.  Total 
long-term finance lease liabilities
 as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were $
122.7
 million and $
47.8
 million, respectively, and are included in other non-current liabilities.
Goodwill
Goodwill is recorded when the cost of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired.  We review goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist.  Impairment losses are recorded when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value.  The balance of goodwill in our Consolidated Balance Sheets reflects adjustments for foreign currency translation.
Other Assets
Other assets consist principally of deferred tax assets, refundable security deposits and advanced payments to vendors.
Derivatives
We have foreign exchange risk related to monetary asset and liability positions at certain subsidiaries.  To mitigate the impacts of these exposures, we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts, generally settled monthly.  We do not apply hedge accounting to these derivatives.  The derivatives are recorded at the fair value either in other current assets or accrued expenses, with the associated gains and losses charged to 
other (income) expense, net
 in the period in which they occur.  Gains and losses recognized on these derivatives are classified as operating activities and are included within other, net in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
We hedge certain net investment positions in foreign subsidiaries.  To accomplish this, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts, generally settled monthly, that are designated as hedges of net investments.  The difference between the forward rate and the spot rate of the net investment hedge forward contracts is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and subsequently reported in other (income) expense, net on a straight-line basis over the life of the forward contracts.  These gains and losses are classified as operating activities and are included within other, net in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  Changes in the fair value of the forward contracts are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) within foreign currency translation.
See Note 15 for further discussion about the derivatives.
Fair Value Measurements
We apply fair value accounting for assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring or nonrecurring basis.  We define fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
  See Note 16 for further discussion of fair value measurements.

Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue, net of sales, use, value-added and other similar taxes, as a performance obligation is satisfied in an amount reflecting the consideration to which we expect to be entitled.  We apply a five-step approach in determining the amount and timing of revenue to be recognized: (1) identifying the contract with a customer; (2) identifying the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determining the transaction price; (4) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognizing revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied.  Substantially all of our revenue is recognized as services are rendered. 
Our packaging and test services are our performance obligations to our customers.  Our packaging services include wafer bump, probe and assembly.  We provide packaging and test services to our customers either individually or as part of a combined offering.  In a combined offering, we account for the individual services separately if they are determined to be distinct.  We determine a service to be distinct if it is separately identifiable from other services in the combined offering and if a customer can benefit from the unique service on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer.
The consideration, including variable consideration, is allocated between the distinct services in a combined offering based upon the stand-alone selling prices of the individual services.  Our services involve a high degree of specialization which are unique based on the design and purpose of the customer’s wafers.  Accordingly, our negotiated pricing reflects the customized nature of our services and represents a customer-specific stand-alone selling price.  We recognize revenue as services are rendered, which generally occurs over the course of two to three weeks.  Services are generally billed at completion of each individual packaging or test service or in some instances at the completion of all services in a combined offering. 
We recognize revenue over time as services are rendered because our services create or enhance the customer’s wafer.  We utilize an input method (cost incurred plus estimated margin) to determine the amount of revenue to recognize for in-process, but incomplete, customer orders at a reporting date.  During the period of providing our services, we generally do not control or take ownership of customers’ wafers, nor do we include the cost of the wafer in our cost calculations.  We believe that a cost-based input method is the most appropriate manner to measure how we satisfy our performance obligations to customers because the effort and costs incurred to package and/or test customer wafers are not linear over the duration of these services.
Shipping and handling costs are accounted for as a cost to fulfill our performance obligations to customers.  Accordingly, we record customer payments of shipping and handling costs as a component of net sales, and the costs incurred for shipping and handling are then charged to cost of sales.
Unbilled receivables are revenues that have been recognized for performance obligations that have been satisfied, or partially satisfied, in advance of billing the customer.  Revenue may be recognized in advance of billing as our contracts provide us with an unconditional right to consideration for work that is performed.  Total unbilled receivables as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $
210.1
 million and $
260.8
 million, respectively.  These amounts are included in accounts receivable, net of allowances in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
At times, we receive cash payments from customers in advance of our performance.  In such cases, we record deferred revenue until the performance obligation is satisfied, which represents a contract liability and is included in accrued expenses and other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.  These contract liabilities are classified as either current or long-term based on the timing of when we expect to recognize revenue.  Contract liabilities were $
95.6
 million and $
135.5
 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.  As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the short-term portion of the liability was $
59.7
 million and $
71.1
 million, respectively.  The remainder of the December 31, 2024 contract liability balance is expected to be recognized in revenue over the next 
1
-
5
 years.  Revenue recognized during the year that was included in the contract liability balance at the beginning of the period was $
66.0
 million, $
66.9
 million, and $
101.2
 million, for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Research and Development Costs
Research and development expenses include costs attributable to the conduct of research and development programs primarily related to the development of new package designs or technologies and improving the efficiency and capabilities of our existing production processes.  Such costs include labor, materials, supplies, depreciation and maintenance of research equipment, services provided by outside contractors and the allocable portions of facility costs such as rent, utilities, insurance, repairs and maintenance, depreciation and general support services.  Costs associated with research and development are expensed as incurred.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method.  Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis as well as for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.  Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.  A valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized.
We monitor on an ongoing basis our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets and whether there is a need for a related valuation allowance.  In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets in the jurisdictions from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and recent results of operations.  With the exception of a certain foreign jurisdiction and select U.S. and foreign carryforwards, we consider it more likely than not that we will have sufficient taxable income to allow us to realize these deferred tax assets.  However, in the event taxable income falls short of current expectations, we may need to establish a valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets.
We recognize in our Consolidated Financial Statements the impact of an income tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position.  Related interest and penalties are classified as income taxes in the financial statements.
  See Note 4 for further discussion regarding unrecognized income tax benefits.
Recently Issued Standards
In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-09,
 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures 
(“ASU 2023-09”).  ASU 2023-09 requires disclosure of additional income tax information, primarily related to effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid.  ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024.  Early adoption is permitted.  Adoption of this ASU should be applied on a prospective basis, but retrospective application is permitted.  The new standard will result in enhanced disclosures in our financial statements.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, 
Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses 
(“ASU 2024-03”), which was subsequently amended and clarified.  ASU 2024-03 requires disaggregation of key expense categories such as inventory purchases, employee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset amortization in the financial statements.  ASU 2024-03 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027.  Early adoption is permitted.  Adoption of this ASU should be applied either prospectively after the effective date or retrospectively to any or all periods presented in the financial statements.  We are currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on our financial statements, which is expected to result in enhanced disclosures.

Share-Based Compensation Plans 
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized share-based compensation of $
18.4
 million, $
8.3
 million and $
13.6
 million, respectively, primarily in selling, general and administrative expenses.  The amount of compensation expense to be recognized is adjusted for an estimated forfeiture rate which is based on historical data.  The corresponding deferred income tax benefits are $
2.4
 million, $
0.7
 million and $
1.7
 million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
Equity Incentive Plans
Second Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan.  
The Second Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (as amended, the “2007 Plan”) provided for the grant of the following types of incentive awards: (i) stock options; (ii) restricted stock; (iii) restricted stock units; (iv) stock appreciation rights; (v) performance units and performance shares; and (vi) other stock or cash awards.  Those eligible for awards included employees, directors and consultants who provide services to Amkor and its subsidiaries.  There were originally 
17.0
 million shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under the 2007 Plan.  No awards have been or will be granted under the 2007 Plan after the effective date of the 2021 Plan (as defined below), but all outstanding awards under the 2007 Plan will continue in full force and effect, subject to their original terms.
2021 Equity Incentive Plan.  
On May 18, 2021, at our 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the “2021 Annual Meeting”), our stockholders approved the Amkor Technology, Inc. 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (as amended, the “2021 Plan”) to replace the 2007 Plan.  The 2021 Plan provides for the grant of the following types of incentive awards: (i) stock options; (ii) restricted stock; (iii) restricted stock units; (iv) stock appreciation rights; (v) performance units and performance shares; and (vi) other stock or cash awards.  Those eligible for awards include employees, directors and consultants who provide services to Amkor and its subsidiaries.  The number of shares authorized and available for issuance under the 2021 Plan is 
23,100,000
 shares, reduced for certain awards granted under the 2007 Plan after December 31, 2020, but before May 18, 2021.  There were originally 
22.8
 million shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under the 2021 Plan, and at December 31, 2024, there were 
19.4
 million shares available for grant under the 2021 Plan.
Stock options
Stock options are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of the stock at the date of grant.  Substantially all of the options granted are exercisable pursuant to a 
one
 to 
four year
 vesting schedule, and the term of the options granted is no longer than 
ten years
.  Upon option exercise, we may issue new shares of common or treasury stock.
In order to calculate the fair value of stock options at the date of grant, we use the Black-Scholes option pricing model.  Expected volatilities are based on historical performance of our stock.  We also use historical data to estimate the timing and amount of option exercises and forfeitures within the valuation model.  The expected term of the options is based on evaluations of historical and expected future employee exercise behavior and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.  The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.  The dividend yield is based on the annualized declared quarterly dividend rate divided by our closing stock price at the date of the grant.  There have been no stock options granted since 2021.

Restricted stock units
From time to time, and pursuant to the 2021 Plan, we grant time-vested restricted stock units (“RSUs”) to our non-employee directors and certain employees and performance-vested restricted stock units (“PSUs”) to certain employees.  RSUs granted prior to 2024 generally vest in 
four
 equal installments over a 
four-year
 period such that 
100
% of the RSUs will become vested on the fourth anniversary of the award, subject to the recipient’s continued employment with us on the applicable vesting dates.  The general vesting period for RSUs granted since the start of 2024 decreased to 
three years
.  In some circumstances, we have granted RSUs subject to different vesting conditions, including RSUs that vest in a single installment or on a ratable schedule.  Provided that the RSUs have not been forfeited earlier, they will generally vest upon the recipient’s retirement, death or disability, or upon a change in control of Amkor, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable award agreement.  The value of the RSUs is determined based on the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of the grant, reduced by the present value of dividends or dividend equivalent rights expected to be paid on our common stock prior to vesting, and is recognized ratably over the vesting period. 
PSUs granted prior to 2024 generally vest in 
one
 installment after a 
two-year
 period such that any earned PSUs will become vested within 
90
 days of the second anniversary of the award, subject to the recipient’s continued employment with us on the applicable vesting date.  Generally for these PSUs, the number of shares of our common stock to be received at vesting will range from 
0
% to 
200
% of the target grant amount based on Cumulative Basic EPS (as defined in the applicable award agreement) over a 
two-year
 performance measurement period.  In some circumstances, we have granted PSUs subject to different vesting conditions, including PSUs that vest in full upon the achievement of performance goals other than Cumulative Basic EPS.
In 2024, we granted PSUs that were divided between PSUs based on earnings per share in each of 2024, 2025 and 2026 (“EPS PSUs”), and PSUs based on relative total shareholder return (“rTSR PSUs”) as compared to the components of the PHLX Semiconductor Index (the “SOX”) over a 
three-year
 period, with half of the awards as EPS PSUs and half as rTSR PSUs.  EPS PSUs will vest in 
three
 installments over a 
three-year
 period such that any earned PSUs will become vested within 
90
 days of each year ending 2024, 2025 and 2026, subject to the recipient’s continued employment with us on the applicable vesting dates.  For EPS PSUs, the number of shares of our common stock to be received at vesting will range from 
0
% to 
225
% of the target grant amount.  The rTSR PSUs will vest in 
one
 installment after a 
three-year
 period and the number of shares of our common stock to be received at vesting will range from 
0
% to 
150
% of the target grant amount based on rTSR performance over the 
three-year
 performance period.
Provided the PSUs have not been forfeited earlier, the PSUs will generally vest upon the recipient’s retirement, death or disability, or upon a change of control of Amkor, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable award agreement.  For the PSUs granted prior to 2024 and the EPS PSUs, the value is initially determined based on the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of the grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be

paid on our common stock prior to vesting.  For the rTSR PSUs, we estimated the grant-date fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation model, using the following weighted-average assumptions: risk-free interest rate of 
4.33
% and annualized volatility of 
46.77
%.  We recognize the grant date fair value of the PSUs as compensation expense ratably over the vesting period.

In 2022, we reversed $
17.8
 million of valuation allowance recorded against U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards previously projected to expire unused due to the limitations to utilize the credits under current tax law.  Realization of these carryforwards is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income to overcome the foreign tax credit limitation provisions.  Although utilization of these carryforwards is not assured, in light of our current earnings and recent

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
estimates of future taxable income, management believes sufficient positive evidence exists to conclude that the respective valuation allowances are no longer needed, resulting in the reversal of these valuation allowances.
As a result of certain capital investments, export commitments and employment levels, income from operations in Korea, Singapore and Vietnam was subject to reduced income tax rates and, in some cases, was exempt from income taxes. 

The most significant tax rate impact is in Singapore where we have been granted a conditional reduced tax rate that expires at the end of 2028.  We recognized $
33.2
 million, $
18.6
 million and $
84.5
 million in tax benefits as a result of the conditional reduced tax rates in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  The benefit of the conditional reduced tax rates on diluted earnings per share was approximately $

We monitor on an ongoing basis our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets and whether there is a need for a related valuation allowance.  In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets in the jurisdictions from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and recent results of operations.

Distributions of cash to the U.S. as dividends generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax.  We have not provided foreign withholding taxes or state income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, over which we have sufficient influence to control the distribution of such earnings and have determined that substantially all such earnings have been reinvested indefinitely.  These earnings could become subject to foreign withholding tax if they are remitted as dividends.  For the year ended December 31, 2024, we estimate that repatriation of these foreign earnings would generate withholding taxes and state income taxes of approximately $
160
 million.  
We operate in and file income tax returns in various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions which are subject to examination by tax authorities.  We have tax returns that are open to examination in various jurisdictions for tax years 2013-2024.  The open years contain matters that could be subject to differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations related to the amount and/or timing of income, deductions and tax credits.  There can be no assurance that the outcome of examinations will be favorable.  Our unrecognized tax benefits are subject to change as examinations of specific tax years are completed in the respective jurisdictions.  In certain circumstances where we elect to appeal the results of an 
71

examination, we may be required to make tax assessment payments to proceed with the administrative appeal process.  Current examinations include 2017-2021 Malaysia income tax returns and 2021 Philippine income tax return.

The net increase in our unrecognized tax benefits was $
4.8
 million from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024.  The increase was primarily related to income attribution.  At December 31, 2024, $
32.7
 million of our gross unrecognized tax benefits would reduce our effective tax rate, if recognized.  It is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefits primarily related to income attribution will decrease in the next 12 months by up to $
6.6
 million due to the lapse of statutes of limitations in foreign jurisdictions.
The liability related to our unrecognized tax benefits, before interest and penalties, was $
21.9
 million as of December 31, 2024 and is reported as a component of other non-current liabilities.  The unrecognized tax benefits presented in the table above also include positions that have reduced deferred tax assets by $
14.4
 million.  The balance of accrued and unpaid interest and penalties was $
4.5
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and is included as a component of other non-current liabilities in connection with our unrecognized tax benefits.

Earnings Per Share 
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net income attributable to Amkor common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  The weighted-average number of common shares outstanding is reduced for treasury stock.
Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period.  Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options, PSUs, RSUs and unvested restricted shares.

Factoring of Accounts Receivable
For certain accounts receivable, we use non-recourse factoring arrangements with third-party financial institutions to manage our working capital and cash flows.  Under these arrangements, we sell receivables to a financial institution for cash at a discount to the face amount.  As part of the factoring arrangements, we perform certain collection and administrative functions for the receivables sold.  For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we sold accounts receivable totaling $

Compliance with Debt Covenants
The debt of Amkor Technology, Inc. is structurally subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future debt and other liabilities of our subsidiaries.  From time to time, Amkor Technology, Inc., ATT, AATT and ATSH guarantee certain debt of our subsidiaries.  The agreements governing our indebtedness contain affirmative and negative covenants which restrict our ability to pay dividends and could restrict our operations.  These restrictions are determined in part by calculations based upon cumulative net income and do not currently have a material impact on our ability to make dividend payments or stock repurchases.  
We were in compliance with all debt covenants at December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Pension and Severance Plans 
Korean Severance Plan
Our subsidiary in Korea maintains an unfunded severance plan that covers certain employees that were employed prior to August 1, 2015.  To the extent eligible employees are terminated, our subsidiary in Korea would be required to make lump-sum severance payments on behalf of these eligible employees for service provided prior to August 1, 2015.  Factors used to determine severance benefits include employees’ length of service, seniority and rate of pay.  The employees’ length of service and seniority are fixed as of July 31, 2015.  The employees’ rate of pay is adjusted to the rate of pay at the time of termination.  Accrued severance benefits are estimated assuming all eligible employees were to terminate their employment at the balance sheet date.  Our contributions to the National Pension Plan of the Republic of Korea are deducted from accrued severance benefit liabilities.  On August 1, 2015, our subsidiary in Korea began sponsoring a defined benefit pension plan and a defined contribution plan.  Existing employees at that time were given the option of choosing either a defined benefit pension plan or a defined contribution plan for their future benefits and new employees since that date are enrolled in a defined contribution plan. 
The changes to the balance of our accrued severance plan obligations are as follows:

5
 million of obligations from our Korean severance plan to a defined contribution plan, which is expected to be funded during the first quarter of 2025.

The measurement date for determining the Plans’ assets and benefit obligations is December 31, each year.  Discount rates are generally derived from yield curves constructed from high-quality corporate or foreign government bonds, for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts. 
The expected rate of return assumption is based on weighted-average expected returns for each asset class.  Expected returns reflect a combination of historical performance analysis and the forward-looking views of the financial markets and include input from our actuaries.  We have no control over the direction of our investments in our defined benefit plans in Taiwan as the local Labor Standards Law Fund mandates such contributions into a cash account balance at the Bank of Taiwan.  Our defined benefit pension plan in Malaysia is a non-funded plan, and as such, no asset exists related to this plan.  Our investment strategies for our defined benefit plans in Japan, Korea and the Philippines are based on long-term, sustained asset growth through low to medium risk investments.  
The current rate of return assumption targets are based on asset allocation strategies as follows:

The accounts earn a minimum guaranteed rate of return and are invested in a mix of cash, domestic and foreign equity securities and domestic and foreign debt securities.  
We expect to make contributions of approximately $
10
 million during 2025.  We closely monitor the funded status of the Plans with respect to legislative requirements.  We intend to make at least the minimum contribution required by law each year.

 million due to the impact of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, which includes the forward costs, and the related hedged items.  For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the derivatives not designated as hedging instruments resulted in a net loss of $
38.6
 million and $
60.2
 million, respectively, which were partially offset by the foreign currency gains associated with the underlying net liabilities.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, a gain of $
4.4
 million was recognized in other (income) expense, net for the difference between the forward rate and the spot rate of the net investment hedge.  For the year ended December 31, 2024, a gain of $
1.0
 million was recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) for the changes in fair value of the net investment hedge.  There was no activity related to net investment hedges for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.

Fair Value Measurements 
The accounting framework for determining fair value includes a hierarchy for ranking the quality and reliability of the information used to measure fair value, which enables the reader of the financial statements to assess the inputs used to develop those measurements.  The fair value hierarchy consists of three tiers as follows: Level 1, defined as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2, defined as inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.  For our Level 2 short-term investments, we consider factors such as actual trade data, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes, and other similar data obtained from quoted market prices and independent pricing vendors to determine the fair value of these assets and liabilities.
The fair values of cash, accounts receivable, trade accounts payable, capital expenditures payable, and certain other current assets and accrued expenses approximate carrying values because of their short-term nature.  The carrying value of certain other non-current assets and liabilities approximates fair value.  Our assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis include restricted cash money market funds and short-term investments, including investments classified as cash equivalents.  Cash equivalent money market funds and restricted cash money market funds are invested in U.S. money market funds and various U.S. and foreign bank operating and time deposit accounts, which are due on demand or carry a maturity date of less than three months when purchased.  No restrictions have been imposed on us regarding withdrawal of balances with respect to our cash equivalents as a result of liquidity or other credit market issues affecting the money market funds we invest in or the counterparty financial institutions holding our deposits.  
Our derivative financial instruments are valued using quoted market prices for similar assets.  Counterparties to these derivative contracts are highly rated financial institutions. 
We also measure certain assets and liabilities, including property, plant and equipment and goodwill, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.  
We measure the fair value of our debt for disclosure purposes.  
The following table presents the fair value of our debt:

The estimated fair value of our senior notes is based primarily on quoted market prices reported on or near the respective balance sheet dates.  The estimated fair value of our revolving credit facilities and term loans is calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis, which utilizes market-based assumptions including forward interest rates adjusted for credit risk.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
We are involved in claims and legal proceedings and may become involved in other legal matters arising in the ordinary course of our business.  We evaluate these claims and legal matters on a case-by-case basis to make a determination as to the impact, if any, on our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.  Although the outcome of these matters is uncertain, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these claims and proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact to us.  Our evaluation of the potential impact of these claims and legal proceedings on our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could change in the future.

Business Segments, Customer Concentrations and Geographic Information 
We operate as a single operating segment as managed by our Chief Executive Officer, who is considered our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”).  The CODM bears the ultimate responsibility for, and is actively engaged in, the allocation of resources and the evaluation of our operating and financial results.  We have concluded that we have a single operating segment based on the following:
•
We are managed under a functionally-based organizational structure with the head of each function reporting directly to the CODM;
•
Our CODM assesses performance, including resource allocation, trend identification and variance analysis, based on consolidated operating performance and financial results based on net income;
•
Our CODM allocates resources and makes other operating decisions based on specific customer business opportunities; and
•
We have an integrated process for the design, development and manufacturing services we provide to all of our customers.  We also have centralized sales and administrative functions.

Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports to the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, based on the definition of “disclosure controls and procedures” in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures.
We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024, and concluded those disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of that date.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).  Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.
Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the framework established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”).  Based on the results of this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Item 9B.
Other Information
During the three months ended December 31, 2024, no director or officer of the Company 
adopted
 or 
terminated
 a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,” as such terms are defined in paragraphs (a) and (c), respectively, of Item 408 of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
On February 20, 2025, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of the Company amended and restated the Restated Bylaws of the Company (as amended and restated, the “Bylaws”), effective February 20, 2025.  The changes to the Bylaws include the following:
•
Sections 1.1 and 1.2 were amended to clarify that annual meetings and special meetings of the Company’s stockholders may be held in whole or in part by means of remote communication.
•
Sections 1.4 and 1.5 were amended to clarify and further enhance procedural mechanics and informational requirements in connection with stockholder nominations of directors and submissions of stockholder proposals pursuant to the advance notice provisions of the Bylaws, including updates to reflect the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s adoption of “universal proxy” rules as set forth in Rule 14a-19 (“Rule 14a-19”) under the Exchange Act.  The amended advance notice provisions now require, among other things, that (a) stockholders seeking to nominate directors pursuant to Rule 14a-19 comply with the requirements of such rule and certify such compliance prior to the applicable meeting, (b) nominating stockholders and their nominee(s) disclose their respective holdings of, and arrangements relating to, shares of the Company, including any agreements, plans or proposals that would be required to be disclosed on Schedule 13D under the Exchange Act, (c) any Proposing Person(s) (as defined in the Bylaws) provide in the required notice additional background information, disclosures, and representations with respect to such Proposing Person(s), any proposed director nominees, and any proposed business, and (d) the Proposing Person(s) update such notice, if necessary, so that it remains true and correct closer to the meeting date.
•
Section 1.9 was amended to provide that any stockholder soliciting proxies from other stockholders must use a proxy card color other than white, which will be reserved for the exclusive use by the Board.
•
Section 2.7 was amended to clarify that the Board may elect one of its members to serve as chairman, and that the Board may appoint, in its discretion, a vice chairman.
•
Section 6.1 was amended to clarify that the term “officer,” as used in the indemnification provisions of Article VI of the Bylaws, shall refer exclusively to officers appointed by the Board pursuant to Article IV of the Bylaws, or, for entities other than the Company, to officers appointed by the equivalent governing body of such entity.
•
Section 8.1 was amended to provide that the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the exclusive forum for any actions against the Company arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.  The amended Section 8.1 also provides that stockholders who file a Foreign Action (as defined in the Bylaws) that falls within the scope of the Company’s forum selection clause are deemed to have consented, for certain actions to enforce the Company’s forum selection clause, to (a) the personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery and (b) having service of process made upon such stockholder’s counsel in the Foreign Action.
In addition, certain other ministerial, modernizing, clarifying and conforming changes were made to the Bylaws.  The foregoing summary of the changes effectuated by the amendment and restatement of the Bylaws does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Bylaws, a copy of which is included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(2)  Consists of the 2007 Plan and the 2021 Plan.
(3)  Includes 1.6 million shares of common stock subject to RSUs and PSUs, which entitle each holder to one share of common stock for each unit that vests over the holder’s period of continued service or based on the achievement of certain performance criteria.
(4)  Represents the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2021 Plan, as adjusted to account for full-value awards, which reduce the shares of common stock available for future issuance at a fungible ratio of 1:1.5 for each full-value award previously awarded.  The 2007 Plan terminated on the date of the 2021 Annual Meeting, and, accordingly, there were no shares available for future grants under the 2007 Plan as of December 31, 2024.  However, if an award under the 2021 Plan or under the 2007 Plan is forfeited, terminated, canceled, expires or is paid in cash, the shares subject to such award, to the extent of the forfeiture, termination, cancellation, expiration or cash payment, may be added back to the shares available for issuance under the 2021 Plan on a 1:1 basis for options and stock appreciation rights and on a 1.5:1 basis for all other equity awards.
The 2021 Plan, which was approved by our stockholders at the 2021 Annual Meeting, superseded and replaced the 2007 Plan.  As of December 31, 2024, a total of 19.4 million shares were available for issuance under the 2021 Plan.  Shares available for issuance under our 2021 Plan can be granted pursuant to stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, stock appreciation rights, PSUs and performance shares.
