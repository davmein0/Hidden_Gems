 TFS FINANCIAL CORPORATION
TFS Financial Corporation (“we,” “us,” or “our”) was organized in 1997 as the mid-tier stock holding company for the Association. We completed our initial public stock offering in 2007 and issued 100,199,618 shares of common stock, or 30.16% of our post-offering outstanding common stock, to subscribers in the offering. Additionally, at the time of the public offering, 5,000,000 shares of our common stock, or 1.50% of our outstanding shares, were issued to the newly formed charitable foundation, Third Federal Foundation. Third Federal Savings, MHC, our mutual holding company parent, held and continues to hold, the remainder of our outstanding common stock (227,119,132 shares). Net proceeds from our initial public stock offering were approximately $886 million and reflected the costs we incurred in completing the offering as well as a $106.5 million loan to the ESOP related to its acquisition of shares in the initial public stock offering.
Our ownership of the Association remains our primary business activity. We also operate Third Capital, Inc. as a wholly-owned subsidiary. See 
THIRD CAPITAL, INC.
 below.
As the holding company of the Association, we are authorized to pursue other business activities permitted by applicable laws and regulations for savings and loan holding companies, which include making equity investments and the acquisition of banking and financial services companies.
Our cash flow depends primarily on earnings from the investment in the Association, and any dividends we receive from the Association and Third Capital, Inc. All of our officers are also officers of the Association. In addition, we use the services of the support staff of the Association from time to time. We may hire additional associates, as needed, to the extent we expand our business in the future.
THIRD CAPITAL, INC.
Third Capital, Inc. is a Delaware corporation that was organized in 1998 as our wholly-owned subsidiary. At September 30, 2024, Third Capital, Inc. had consolidated assets of $9.2 million, and for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, Third Capital, Inc. had consolidated net income of $0.2 million. Third Capital, Inc. has no separate operations other than as the holding company for its operating subsidiaries, and as a minority investor or partner in other entities. As of September 30, 2024, the only remaining entity in which Third Capital, Inc. has an investment in is Third Cap Associates, Inc., an Ohio corporation that owns 49% and 60% of two title agencies that provide escrow and settlement services in the States of Ohio, Florida and New Jersey, primarily to customers of the Association. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, Third Cap Associates, Inc. recorded net income of $0.2 million. 
THIRD FEDERAL SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATION OF CLEVELAND
General
The Association is a federally chartered savings and loan association headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, that was organized in 1938. In 1997, the Association reorganized into its current two-tier mutual holding company structure. The Association’s principal business consists of originating and servicing residential real estate mortgage loans and attracting retail savings deposits.
The Association’s primary business strategy is to originate mortgage loans with interest rates that are competitive with those of similar products offered by other financial institutions in its markets. Similarly, the Association offers checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts and certificate of deposit accounts, each bearing interest rates that are competitive with similar products offered by other financial institutions in its markets. The Association expects to continue to pursue this business philosophy. While this strategy does not enable the Association to earn the highest rates of interest on loans that it offers or to pay the lowest rates on its deposit accounts, the Association believes that this strategy is the primary reason for its successful growth in the past and will continue to be a successful strategy in the future.
The Association attracts retail deposits from the general public in the areas surrounding its main office and its branch offices. It also utilizes its internet website, direct mail solicitation and its customer service call center to generate loan applications and attract retail deposits. Longer-term brokered CDs and advances from the FHLB of Cincinnati as well as shorter-term brokered CDs and advances from the FHLB of Cincinnati, hedged to longer effective durations by interest rate exchange contracts, are also used as cost-effective funding alternatives. In addition to residential real estate mortgage loans, the Association originates residential construction loans to individuals for the construction of their personal residences by a qualified builder. The Association also offers home equity loans and lines of credit subject to certain property and credit performance conditions. The Association retains in its portfolio a large portion of the loans that it originates. The Association also purchases residential real estate mortgage loans through a correspondent lending partnership. Loans that the Association sells consist primarily of long-term, fixed-rate residential real estate mortgage loans. The Association currently retains the servicing rights on all loans that it sells. The Association’s revenues are derived primarily from interest on loans and, to a lesser 
5
Table of Contents

extent, interest on interest-earning deposits in other financial institutions, deposits maintained at the FRS, federal funds sold, investment securities, including mortgage-backed securities and dividends from FHLB of Cincinnati stock. The Association also generates revenues from fees, gains on loan sales and service charges. The Association’s primary sources of funds are deposits, borrowings, principal and interest payments on loans and securities and proceeds from loan sales.
The Association’s website address is 
www.thirdfederal.com
. Filings of the Company made with the SEC are available, without charge, on the Association’s website. Information on that website is not and should not be considered a part of this document.
Market Area
The Association conducts its operations from its main office in Cleveland, Ohio, and from 37 additional, full-service branches and two loan production offices located throughout the states of Ohio and Florida. In Ohio, the Association maintains 21 full-service offices located in the northeast Ohio counties of Cuyahoga, Lake, Lorain, Medina and Summit, one regional loan production office located in the central Ohio (Columbus, Ohio) and one regional loan production office located in the southern Ohio county of Butler (Cincinnati, Ohio). In Florida, the Association maintains 16 full-service branches located in the counties of Pasco, Pinellas, Hillsborough, Sarasota, Lee, Collier, Palm Beach and Broward. 
The Association also provides savings and loan products in states outside of its core markets of Ohio, Florida, Kentucky and Indiana using its customer service call center and its internet site. The Association also purchases first mortgage loans from its correspondent lending partner, in Ohio, Indiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Pennsylvania and Michigan. Savings products are available in all 50 states, while first mortgage loans, home equity lines of credit, home equity loans and bridge loans are offered in up to 27 states and the District of Columbia. 
Competition
The Association faces intense competition in its market areas both in making loans and attracting deposits. Its market areas have a high concentration of financial institutions, including large money centers and regional banks, community banks and credit unions, and it faces additional competition for deposits from money market funds, brokerage firms, mutual funds and insurance companies. Some of its competitors offer products and services that the Association currently does not offer, such as commercial business loans, trust services and private banking.
The majority of the Association’s deposits are held in its offices located in Cuyahoga County, Ohio. As of June 30, 2024 (the latest date for which information is publicly available), the Association had $5.72 billion of deposits in Cuyahoga County, and ranked fifth among all financial institutions with offices in the county in terms of deposits, with a market share of 5.40%. As of that date, the Association had $7.35 billion of deposits in the State of Ohio, and ranked tenth among all financial institutions in the state in terms of deposits, with a market share of 1.37%. As of June 30, 2024 (the latest date for which information is publicly available), the Association had $2.83 billion of deposits in the State of Florida, and ranked 34th among all financial institutions in terms of deposits, with a market share of 0.34%. This market share data excludes deposits held by credit unions, whose deposits are not insured by the FDIC.
 Many financial institutions, including institutions that compete in our markets, have targeted retail deposit gathering as a more attractive funding source than borrowings, and have become more active and more competitive in their deposit product pricing. The combination of reduced demand for borrowed funds and more competition with respect to rates paid to depositors has created an increasingly difficult marketplace for attracting deposits, which could adversely affect future operating results.
From October 2023 through August 2024 (the latest date for which information is publicly available), per data furnished by MarketTrac
®
, the Association had the second largest market share of conventional purchase mortgage loans originated in Cuyahoga County, Ohio. For the same period, it also had the third largest market share of conventional purchase mortgage loans originated in the seven northeast Ohio counties which comprise the Cleveland and Akron metropolitan statistical areas. In addition, based on the same statistics, the Association has consistently been one of the twenty-five largest lenders in both Franklin County (Columbus, Ohio) and Hamilton County (Cincinnati, Ohio) since it entered those markets in 1999.
The Association’s primary strategy for increasing and retaining its customer base is to offer competitive deposit and loan rates and other product features, delivered with exceptional customer service, in each of the markets it serves.
We rely on the reputation that has been built during the Association’s 86-year history of serving its customers and the communities in which it operates, the Association’s high capital levels, and the Association's extensive liquidity alternatives which, in combination, serve to maintain and nurture customer and marketplace confidence. At September 30, 2024, our ratio of shareholders’ equity to total assets was 10.9%. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, the Association's liquidity ratio averaged 5.95% (which we compute as the sum of cash and cash equivalents plus unpledged investment securities for which 
6
Table of Contents

ready markets exist, divided by total average assets). See Item 
7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Liquidity and Capital Resources
.
We continue to utilize a multi-faceted approach to support our efforts to instill customer and marketplace confidence. First, we provide thorough and timely information to all of our associates so as to prepare them for their day-to-day interactions with customers and other individuals who are not part of the Company. We believe that it is important that our customers and others sense the comfort level and confidence of our associates throughout their dealings. Second, we encourage our management team to maintain a presence and to be available in our branches and other areas of customer contact, so as to provide more opportunities for informal contact and interaction with our customers and community members. Third, our CEO remains accessible to both local and national media, as a spokesman for our institution as well as an observer and interpreter of financial marketplace situations and events. Fourth, we periodically include advertisements in local newspapers and online which display our strong capital levels and history of service. We also continue to emphasize our traditional tagline—“STRONG * STABLE * SAFE”—in our advertisements, website, online presence and branch displays. Finally, for customers who adhere to the old adage of trust but verify, we refer them to the safety/security rankings of a nationally recognized, independent rating organization that specializes in the evaluation of financial institutions, which has awarded the Association its highest rating for more than one hundred consecutive quarters.
Lending Activities
The Company’s principal lending activity is the origination of up to 30-year fixed-rate and adjustable-rate, first mortgage loans to purchase or refinance residential real estate. Also, the Company offers home equity loans and lines of credit and originates residential construction loans to individuals (for the construction of their personal residences by a qualified builder). The Company lends in 27 states and the District of Columbia and, through a correspondent lending partnership, we purchase first mortgages in six of those states. At September 30, 2024, fixed-rate and adjustable-rate, first mortgage residential real estate loans totaled $11.43 billion, or 74.5% of our loan portfolio, home equity lines of credit totaled $3.32 billion, or 21.7% of our loan portfolio, home equity loans and bridge loans totaled $560.9 million, or 3.7% of our loan portfolio, and residential construction loans totaled $21.7 million, or 0.2% of our loan portfolio. At September 30, 2024, adjustable-rate, residential real estate, first mortgage loans totaled $4.38 billion and comprised 28.5% of our loan portfolio. Refer to Item

The following table provides the amortized cost and an analysis of our real estate loans held for investment disaggregated by refreshed FICO score, year of origination and portfolio at September 30, 2024. The Company treats the FICO score information as demonstrating that underwriting guidelines reduce risk rather than as a credit quality indicator utilized in the evaluation of credit risk. Revolving loans reported at amortized cost include home equity lines of credit currently in their draw period. Revolving loans converted to term are home equity lines of credit that are in repayment. Home equity loans and bridge loans are segregated by origination year.

Residential Real Estate Mortgage Loans.
 The Company’s primary lending activity is the origination of residential real estate mortgage loans. A comparison of 2024 data to the corresponding 2023 data can be found in Item 
7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation
. The Company currently offers fixed-rate conventional mortgage loans with terms of 30 years or less that are fully amortizing with monthly loan payments, and adjustable-rate mortgage loans that amortize over a period of up to 30 years, provide an initial fixed interest rate for three or five years and then adjust annually, subject to rate reset options as discussed later in this section. At September 30, 2024, there were no “interest only” residential real estate mortgage loans held in the Company's portfolio. 
The Company generally originates or purchases both fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgage loans in amounts up to 2 million dollars, for owner occupied, one- to four-family homes in most of our lending markets. The loans originated or purchased for dollar amounts on the higher end of the range are commonly referred to as “jumbo loans.” The Company generally underwrites jumbo loans in a manner similar to conforming loans. Jumbo loans are not uncommon in the Company’s market areas. 
The Company offers “Smart Rate” adjustable-rate mortgage loan products secured by residential properties with interest rates that are fixed for an initial period of three or five years, after which the interest rate generally resets every year based upon a contractual spread or margin linked to the Prime Rate as published in the Wall Street Journal. As part of a loan retention program, these adjustable-rate loans provide the borrower with an attractive rate reset option, which allows the borrower to re-lock the rate an unlimited number of times at the Company’s then current lending rates, for another three or five years (which must be the same as the original lock period), generally for a fee. Re-lock eligibility is subject to a satisfactory payment performance history by the borrower (current at the time of re-lock, and no foreclosures or bankruptcies since the Smart Rate application was taken). In addition to a satisfactory payment history, re-lock eligibility requires that the property continues to be the borrower's primary residence. The loan term cannot be extended in connection with a re-lock, nor can new funds be advanced. All interest rate caps and floors remain as originated. "Smart Rate" adjustable-rate mortgage loans represent 99.6% of the adjustable-rate mortgage loan portfolio, with the difference representing the remaining balance of legacy adjustable-rate mortgage loan products with slightly different interest rate reset terms. Many of the borrowers who select adjustable-rate mortgage loans have shorter-term credit needs than those who select long-term, fixed-rate mortgage loans. Adjustable-rate mortgage loans generally present different credit risks than fixed-rate mortgage loans primarily because the underlying debt service payments of the borrowers increase as interest rates increase, thereby increasing the potential for default. All of the Company’s adjustable-rate mortgage loans are subject to periodic and lifetime limitations on interest rate changes. All adjustable-rate mortgage loans have initial and periodic caps of two percentage points on interest rate changes, with a cap of six percentage points for the life of the loan. The Company has never offered “Option ARM” loans, where borrowers can pay less than the interest owed on their loan, resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan.
The Company has always considered the promotion of home ownership a primary goal. In that regard, it has historically offered affordable housing programs in all of its market areas. These programs are targeted toward low- and moderate-income home buyers. The Company’s philosophy has been to provide borrowers the opportunity for home ownership within their financial means. During fiscal 2016, the Company began to market its Home Ready mortgage loan product for low- and moderate-income homeowners. Third Federal’s Home Ready product is designed to be saleable to Fannie Mae under its Home Ready program, although not all Home Ready loans are sold. Previously, the Company’s primary affordable housing program was referred to as "Home Today". The vast majority of loans originated under the Home Today program had higher risk characteristics than our Core residential real estate mortgage loan, but the Company attempted to mitigate that higher risk through the use of private mortgage insurance and continued pre- and post-purchase counseling. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had $40.9 million of loans outstanding that were originated through its Home Today program, most of which were originated prior to 2009. At September 30, 2024, of the loans that were originated under the Home Today program, 4.5% were delinquent 30 days or more compared to 0.2% for the portfolio of Core loans as of that date. At September 30, 2024, $0.7 million, or 1.7%, of loans originated under the Home Today program were delinquent 90 days and over and $3.7 million of

Home Today loans were non-accruing loans, representing 10.93% of total non-accruing loans as of that date. See 
Delinquent Loans 
and
 Non-performing Assets and Modified Loans
 for discussions of the asset quality of this portion of the Company’s loan portfolio.
The Company currently retains the servicing rights on all loans sold in order to generate fee income and reinforce its commitment to customer service. One- to four-family residential mortgage real estate loans that have been sold were underwritten generally to Fannie Mae guidelines. At the time of the closing of these loans, the Company owns the loans and subsequently sells them to Fannie Mae and others providing normal and customary representations and warranties, including representations and warranties related to compliance, generally with Fannie Mae underwriting standards. At the time of sale, the loans are free from encumbrances except for the mortgages filed by the Company which, with other underwriting documents, are subsequently assigned and delivered to Fannie Mae and others. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized servicing fees, net of amortization, related to these servicing rights of $4.3 million and $4.5 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the principal balance of loans serviced for others totaled $1.97 billion and $1.93 billion, respectively. At September 30, 2024, substantially all of the loans serviced for Fannie Mae and others were performing in accordance with their contractual terms and management believes that it had no material repurchase obligations associated with these loans at that date. However, at September 30, 2024, a reserve of $0.4 million has been maintained to cover potential losses on repurchases or reimbursements that may arise in connection with representations and warranties made at time of sale.
The Company requires title insurance on all of its residential real estate mortgage loans. The Company also requires that borrowers maintain fire and extended coverage casualty insurance (and, if appropriate, flood insurance up to $250 thousand) in an amount at least equal to the lesser of the loan balance or the replacement cost of the improvements. A majority of its residential real estate mortgage loans have a mortgage escrow account from which disbursements are made for real estate taxes and to a lesser extent for hazard insurance and flood insurance. The Company does not conduct environmental testing on residential real estate mortgage loans unless specific concerns for hazards are identified by the appraiser used in connection with the origination of the loan.
For home purchase loans with LTV ratios at origination in excess of 85% but equal to or less than 90%, the Company generally requires private mortgage insurance. LTV ratios in excess of 85% are not available for refinance transactions except for Home Ready loans. The Home Ready product requires private mortgage insurance on purchase transactions between 80.01% and 97% LTV and refinance transactions between 80.01% and 95% LTV. Beginning in fiscal year 2020, the Company offered a loan product allowing up to 95% LTV with no mortgage insurance for superior credit borrowers. This program involved loans originated with higher interest rates than the Company's other residential real estate loans, and to qualify for this program the loan applicant must satisfy more stringent underwriting criteria (credit score, income qualification, and other criteria). During fiscal year 2024, this program was suspended and as of September 30, 2024, the Company had $369.0 million of loans outstanding that were originated through this high LTV program.
Home Equity Loans and Home Equity Lines of Credit
.
 The Company offers home equity loans and home equity lines of credit, which are primarily secured by a second mortgage on residences. The home equity product is offered in 27 states and the District of Columbia. Home equity lines of credit originated since 2013 require amortizing loan payments during the draw period. These offers were, and are, subject to certain property and credit performance conditions which, among other items, related to CLTV, geography, borrower income verification, minimum credit scores and draw period duration. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, home equity loans totaled $560.9 million, or 3.7%, and $331.0 million, or 2.2%, respectively, of total loans receivable (which included $12.6 million and $9.5 million of bridge loans), and home equity lines of credit totaled $3.32 billion, or 21.7%, and $2.70 billion, or 17.8%, respectively, of total loans receivable (which included $59.5 million and $68.8 million, respectively, of home equity lines of credit which were in the amortization period and no longer eligible to be drawn upon). Additionally, at September 30, 2024 and 2023, the undrawn amounts of home equity lines of credit totaled $5.22 billion and $4.70 billion, respectively. A bridge loan permits a borrower to utilize the existing equity in their current home to fund the purchase of a new home before the current home is sold. Bridge loans are originated for a one-year term, with no prepayment penalties. These loans have fixed interest rates, and are currently limited to a combined 80% LTV ratio (first and second mortgage liens). The Company charges a closing fee with respect to bridge loans. 
The Company originates its home equity loans and home equity lines of credit without application fees (except for bridge loans) or borrower-paid closing costs. Home equity loans are offered with variable and fixed interest rates, are fully amortizing and have terms of up to 30 years. The Company’s home equity lines of credit are offered with adjustable rates of interest indexed to the Prime Rate, as reported in 
The Wall Street Journal

No other individual state has a committed or drawn balance greater than 10% of our total equity lending portfolio and 5% of total loans.
(2)
Mean CLTV percent at origination for all home equity lines of credit is based on the committed amount.
(3)
Current Mean CLTV is based on best available first mortgage and property values as of September 30, 2024. Property values are estimated using HPI data published by the FHFA. Current Mean CLTV percent for home equity lines of credit in the draw period is calculated using the committed amount. Current Mean CLTV on home equity lines of credit in the repayment period is calculated using the principal balance.
The principal balance of home equity lines of credit in the draw period that have a current mean CLTV over 80% or unknown is $9.2 million, or 0.3%, at September 30, 2024. In recognition of previous past weakness in the housing market, we continue to conduct an expanded loan level evaluation of our home equity lines of credit which are delinquent 90 days or more.
At September 30, 2024, 25.6% of the home equity lending portfolio was either in a first lien position (13.2%), in a subordinate (second) lien position behind a first lien that we held (10.3%) or behind a first lien that was held by a loan that we originated, sold and now service for others (2.1%). At September 30, 2024, 12.5% of the home equity line of credit portfolio in the draw period were making only the minimum payment on the outstanding line balance. Minimum payments include both a principal and interest component.
Construction Loans.
 The Company originates construction loans to individuals for the construction of their personal single-family residence by a qualified builder (construction/permanent loans). The Company’s construction/permanent loans generally provide for disbursements to the builder or sub-contractors during the construction phase as work progresses. During the construction phase, the borrower only pays interest on the drawn balance. Upon completion of construction, the loan converts to a permanent amortizing loan without the expense of a second closing. The Company offers construction/permanent loans with fixed or adjustable rates, and a current maximum loan-to-completed-appraised value ratio of 85%. At September 30, 2024, construction loans totaled $21.7 million, or 0.2% of total loans receivable. At September 30, 2024, the unadvanced portion of these construction loans totaled $11.7 million. Construction financing generally involves greater credit risk than long-term financing on improved, owner-occupied real estate.
Loan Originations, Purchases, Sales, Participations and Servicing.
 Lending activities are primarily conducted by the Company’s loan personnel (all of whom are non-commissioned associates) operating at our main and branch office locations and at our loan production offices. All loans that the Company originates are underwritten pursuant to its policies and procedures, which, for real estate loans, are consistent with the ability to repay guidance provided by the CFPB. The majority of long-term, fixed-rate loans are originated using Fannie Mae processing and underwriting guidelines. Loans originated with the intent to hold for investment, all adjustable-rate loans and some fixed-rate loans are originated using guidelines that are similar, but not identical to Fannie Mae processing and underwriting guidelines. The Company originates both adjustable-rate and fixed-rate loans and advertises extensively throughout its market area. Its ability to originate fixed- or adjustable-rate loans is dependent upon the relative consumer demand for such loans, which is affected by current market interest rates as well as anticipated future market interest rates. The Company’s loan origination and sales activity may be adversely affected by a rising interest rate environment or economic recession, which typically results in decreased loan demand. The Company’s residential real estate mortgage loan originations are generated by its in-house loan representatives, by direct mail solicitations, by referrals 
13
Table of Contents

from existing or past customers, by referrals from local builders and real estate brokers, from calls to its telephone call center and from the internet. The Company also purchases first mortgage loans through a correspondent lending partnership.
The Company determines whether to sell or securitize the loans that it originates, after evaluating current and projected market interest rates, its interest rate risk objectives, its liquidity needs and other factors. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold, or committed to sell, to Fannie Mae, in either whole loan or security form, $247.4 million of long-term, fixed-rate residential real estate mortgage loans, all on a servicing retained basis. The Company has also previously sold to private parties, non-agency eligible, adjustable-rate loans on a servicing retained basis. Those sales evidenced the saleability of our loans that are not originated in accordance with agency specified procedures, including adjustable-rate loans. As described in Item 
7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation
 - 
Controlling Our Interest Rate Risk Exposure
, only a portion of the Company's first mortgage loan originations and purchases are eligible for securitization and sale in Fannie Mae mortgage backed security form. The balance of loans held for sale was $17.8 million at September 30, 2024.
In fiscal year 2022, the Company began purchasing first mortgage loans originated through a correspondent lending partnership. These loans are underwritten by the correspondent lender with generally the same standards as our originated portfolio using Fannie Mae processing and underwriting guidelines. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, we purchased approximately $132.1 million of residential mortgage loans originated by our correspondent lending partner in Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and South Carolina. The Company also has a program to originate loans with the intent to sell using risk-based pricing and loan level price adjustments. The program is marketed under the name Mortgage Passport and is considered a division of the Association. Both purchase and refinance products are offered through Mortgage Passport in 20 states and the District of Columbia, excluding Ohio and Florida. The impact to the Company from the program to date is considered immaterial and therefore no breakout is provided.
Historically, the Company has retained the servicing rights on all residential real estate mortgage loans that it has sold. At September 30, 2024, the Company serviced loans owned by others with a principal balance of $1.97 billion. Loan servicing includes collecting and remitting loan payments, accounting for principal and interest, contacting delinquent borrowers, supervising foreclosures and property dispositions in the event of unremedied defaults, making certain insurance and tax payments on behalf of the borrowers and generally administering the loans. The Company retains a portion of the interest paid by the borrower on the loans it services as consideration for its servicing activities. 
Loan Approval Procedures and Authority
.
 The Company’s lending activities follow written underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by its Board of Directors. The loan approval process is intended to assess the borrower’s ability to repay the loan and the value of the property that will secure the loan. To assess the borrower’s ability to repay, the Company reviews the borrower’s employment and credit history and information on the historical and projected income and expenses of the borrower.
The Company’s policies and loan approval limits are established by its Board of Directors. The Company’s Board of Directors has delegated authority to its Executive Committee (consisting of the Company’s CEO and two directors) to review and assign lending authorities to certain individuals of the Company to consider and approve loans within their designated authority. Residential real estate mortgage loans and construction loans require the approval of one individual with designated underwriting authority.
The Company requires independent third-party valuations of real property. Appraisals are performed by independent licensed/certified appraisers.

Total loans seriously delinquent (i.e. delinquent 90 days or more) were 0.09% of total net loans at both September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. The percentage of loans seriously delinquent to total net loans increased in the residential Core portfolio from 0.05% to 0.06% year to year. Such loans in the residential Home Today portfolio remained at 0.01%. Home equity loans and lines of credit portfolio remained at 0.03%. 
Although delinquencies remain at or near historic lows, recent economic trends and higher interest rates have led to increased delinquencies. Interest rates on home equity lines of credit are tied to the prime rate of interest which remains elevated, resulting in higher and less affordable monthly payments for some borrowers.
Non-performing Assets and Modified Loans
.
 Within 15 days of a borrower’s delinquency, per the Company's collection procedures, it attempts personal, direct contact with the borrower to determine the reason for the delinquency, to ensure that the borrower correctly understands the terms of the loan and to emphasize the importance of making payments on or before the due date. If necessary, subsequent late charges and delinquent notices are issued and the borrower’s account will be monitored on a regular basis thereafter. The Company also mails system-generated reminder notices on a monthly basis. When a loan is more than 30 days past due, the Company attempts to contact the borrower and develop a plan of repayment. By the 90

. 
Loans are placed in non-accrual status when they are contractually 90 days or more past due or if collection of principal or interest in full is in doubt. Loans modified that were in non-accrual status prior to modification and loans with forbearance plans that were subsequently modified, are reported in non-accrual status for a minimum of six months after modification. Loans with a partial charge-off remain in non-accrual until, at a minimum, the loss is recovered. Additionally, home equity loans and lines of credit which are subordinate to a first mortgage lien where the customer is severely delinquent (greater than 90 days past due) and loans in Chapter 7 bankruptcy status where all borrowers have filed, and not reaffirmed or been dismissed, are placed in non-accrual status.

Of the $7.7 million of modified loans during the fiscal year, $3.1 million are less than 90 days past due but included with non-accrual loans for a minimum period of six months from the modification date due to their non-accrual status or forbearance plan prior to modification, because of a prior partial charge-off or because all borrowers have filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not reaffirmed or dismissed. As of September 30, 2024, $1.9 million are included in non-accrual loans that are 90 days or more past due. 
We continue to modify loans to work with borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty to keep their homes and to preserve neighborhoods. Loan modifications may include interest rate reductions, term extensions (generally including capitalization of delinquent amounts), significant payment delays (including forbearance plans, partial payments and repayment of delinquent amounts), other, or a combination thereof.

Collateral-Dependent Loans.
 A loan is considered collateral-dependent when, based on current information and events, the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the sale of the collateral or foreclosure is probable. For discussion on collateral-dependent measurement, refer to Note

The amortized cost of collateral-dependent loans includes loans that have returned to accrual status when contractual payments became less than 90 days past due. These loans continue to be individually evaluated based on collateral until, at a minimum, contractual payments are less than 30 days past due. Also, the amortized cost of non-accrual loans includes loans that are not included in the amortized cost of collateral-dependent loans because they are included in loans collectively evaluated for credit losses.

Real Estate Owned
.
 Real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned until sold. When property is acquired, it is recorded at the estimated fair market value at the date of foreclosure, less estimated costs to sell, establishing a new cost basis. Estimated fair value generally represents the sale price a buyer would be willing to pay on the basis of current market conditions. Subsequent to acquisition, real estate owned is carried at the lower of the cost basis or estimated fair market value, less estimated costs to sell. Increases in the fair market value are recognized through income not exceeding the valuation allowance. Holding costs and declines in estimated fair market value result in charges to expense after acquisition. At September 30, 2024, we had $0.2 million in real estate owned.
Classification of Assets.
 Our policies, consistent with regulatory guidelines, provide for the classification of loans and other assets that are considered to be of lesser quality as substandard, doubtful, or loss assets. An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current payment capacity of the borrower or the collateral pledged has a defined weakness that jeopardizes the liquidation of the debt. Substandard assets include those assets characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable or improbable. Assets (or portions of assets) classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets is not warranted. Assets that do not expose us to risk sufficient to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories, but which possess potential weaknesses that deserve management's attention and may result in further deterioration in their repayment prospects and/or the Company's credit position, are required to be designated as special mention.
When assets meet the classification criteria for either substandard or doubtful, they exhibit similar risk characteristics that result in expected credit losses through the model outputs or qualitative factors. As a result of the allowance analysis, a portion of the credit loss allowance is allocated to such assets. The allowance for credit losses is the amount estimated by management to represent the lifetime losses in our loan portfolio and off-balance sheet commitments. When we classify a problem asset as loss, we charge-off that portion of the asset that is uncollectible. Our determinations as to the classification of our assets and the amount of our credit loss allowances are subject to review by the Company's primary federal regulator, the OCC, which can require that we establish additional credit loss allowances. We regularly review our asset portfolio to determine whether any assets require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. On the basis of our review of assets at September 30, 2024, the amortized cost of classified assets consists of substandard assets of $42.8 million, including $0.2 million of real estate owned, and $7.1 million of assets designated special mention. As of September 30, 2024, there were no individual assets with balances exceeding $1.0 million that were classified as substandard. Substandard assets at September 30, 2024 include $13.9 million of loans 90 or more days past due and $28.7 million of loans less than 90 days past due displaying a weakness sufficient to warrant an adverse classification. Of the $28.7 million of loans less than 90 days past due, $3.1 million were modified during the year. 
Allowance for Credit Losses
.
 We provide for credit losses based on a life of loan methodology. Accordingly, all credit losses are charged to, and all recoveries are credited to, the related allowance. Additions to the allowance for credit losses are provided by charges to income based on various factors which, in our judgment, deserve current recognition in estimating lifetime credit losses. We regularly review the loan portfolio and off-balance sheet exposures and make provisions (or releases) for losses in order to maintain the allowance for credit losses in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our allowance for credit losses is a GVA on our portfolio made up of:
(1)
quantitative GVAs for loans, which are general allowances for credit losses for each loan type based on historical loan loss experience; 
(2)
quantitative GVAs for off-balance sheet credit exposures, which are comprised of expected lifetime losses on unfunded loan commitments to extend credit where the obligations are not unconditionally cancellable; and
17
Table of Contents

(3)
qualitative GVAs, which are adjustments to the quantitative GVAs, maintained to cover uncertainties that affect the estimate of expected credit losses for each loan type.
On October 1, 2023, the IVA established for any loans dependent on cash flows, such as performing TDRs, was eliminated with the adoption of ASU 2022-02. Subsequently, all non-collateral dependent modifications have an allowance estimated through the lifetime loss model. The qualitative GVAs expand our ability to identify and estimate probable losses and are based on our evaluation of the following factors, some of which are consistent with factors that impact the determination of quantitative GVAs. For example, delinquency statistics (both current and historical) are used in developing the quantitative GVAs while the trending of the delinquency statistics is considered and evaluated in the determination of the qualitative GVAs. Factors impacting the determination of qualitative GVAs include, among other:
•
changes in lending policies and procedures including underwriting standards, collection, charge-off or recovery practices;
•
management's view of changes in national, regional, and local economic and business conditions and trends including treasury yields, housing market factors and trends, such as the status of loans in foreclosure, real estate in judgment and real estate owned, and unemployment statistics and trends and how it aligns with economic modeling forecasts;
•
changes in the nature and volume of the portfolios including home equity lines of credit nearing the end of the draw period and adjustable-rate mortgage loans nearing a rate reset;
•
changes in the experience, ability or depth of lending management;
•
changes in the volume or severity of past due loans, volume of non-accrual loans, or the volume and severity of adversely classified loans including the trending of delinquency statistics (both current and historical), historical loan loss experience and trends, the frequency and magnitude of loan modifications, and uncertainty surrounding borrowers’ ability to recover from temporary hardships for which short-term loan restructurings are granted;
•
changes in the quality of the loan review system;
•
changes in the value of the underlying collateral including asset disposition loss statistics (both current and historical) and the trending of those statistics, and additional charge-offs and recoveries on individually reviewed loans;
•
existence of any concentrations of credit; 
•
effect of other external factors such as competition, market interest rate changes or legal and regulatory requirements including market conditions and regulatory directives that impact the entire financial services industry; and
•
limitations within our models to predict life of loan net losses.
Home equity loans and lines of credit generally have higher credit risk than traditional residential mortgage loans. These loans and credit lines are usually in a second lien position and when combined with the first mortgage, result in generally higher overall loan-to-value ratios. In a stressed housing market with high delinquencies and decreasing housing prices, these higher loan-to-value ratios represent a greater risk of loss to the Company. A borrower with more equity in the property has a vested interest in keeping the loan current when compared to a borrower with little or no equity in the property. In light of the past weakness in the housing market and uncertainty with respect to future employment levels and economic prospects, we conduct an expanded loan level evaluation of our home equity loans and lines of credit, including bridge loans used to aid borrowers in buying a new home before selling their old one, which are delinquent 90 days or more. This expanded evaluation is in addition to our traditional evaluation procedures. We have established an allowance for our unfunded commitments on this portfolio, which is recorded in other liabilities. Our home equity loans and lines of credit portfolio continues to comprise a significant portion of our gross charge-offs. At September 30, 2024, we had an amortized cost of $3.93 billion in home equity loans and home equity lines of credit outstanding, of which $4.4 million, or 0.1%, were delinquent 90 days or more.
The allowance for credit losses is evaluated based upon the combined total of the quantitative and qualitative GVAs. Periodically, the carrying value of loans and factors impacting our credit loss analysis are evaluated and the allowance is adjusted accordingly. While we use the best information available to make evaluations, future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on unforeseen changes in loan quality and economic conditions.

We continue to evaluate loans becoming delinquent for potential losses and record provisions for the estimate of those losses. We reported net recoveries in each quarter for the past five years, primarily due to improvements in the values of properties used to secure loans that were fully or partially charged off after the 2008 collapse of the housing market. Charge-offs are recognized on loans identified as collateral-dependent and subject to individual review when the collateral value does not sufficiently support full repayment of the obligation. Recoveries are recognized on previously charged-off loans as borrowers perform their repayment of the obligations or as loans with improved collateral positions reach final resolution. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, recoveries exceeded loan charge-offs by $4.7 million. Subject to changes in the economic environment, a moderate level of charge-offs are expected as delinquent loans are resolved in the future and uncollected balances are charged against the allowance.
Allocation of Allowance for Credit Losses.
 The following table sets forth the allowance for credit losses allocated by loan category, the percent of allowance in each category to the total allowance on loans, and the percent of loans in each category to total loans at the dates indicated. The allowance for credit losses allocated to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses in any particular category and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in other categories. This table does not include allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments, which are primarily related to undrawn home equity lines of credit.

During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, the total allowance for credit losses decreased to $97.8 million, from $104.8 million at September 30, 2023. The total allowance for credit losses is comprised of the asset portion, which is applied to the loan portfolio and the liability portion, which is applied to off-balance sheet exposures, primarily related to undrawn equity exposures. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 the asset and liability portions of the total allowance decreased to $70.0 million from $77.3 million and increased to $27.8 million from $27.5 million, respectively. We recorded a $1.5 million net release for credit losses for the year, consisting of a $1.8 million release from credit losses on loans and a $0.3 million reclassification to credit losses on off-balance sheet exposures. 
Because many variables are considered in determining the appropriate level of general valuation allowances, directional changes in individual considerations do not always align with the directional change in the balance of a particular component of the general valuation allowance. Changes in the allowance for credit losses on loan balances during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, were primarily related to the adoption of ASU 2022-02 at October 1, 2023, which eliminated the Individual Valuation Allowance (IVA) that was established for TDRs dependent on cash flows, and decreases in the Core

portfolio balances primarily due to aging. This was offset by the net impact of increases in the equity portfolios primarily due to new growth and a decrease in total net recovery qualitative factors. 
The amortized cost of the residential Core portfolio decreased 5.7%, or $694.1 million, and its total allowance decreased 19.8%, or $11.0 million, as of September 30, 2024, compared to September 30, 2023. The amortized cost of the home equity loans and lines of credit portfolio increased 28.0%, or $859.7 million, and its total allowance increased 22.5% to $28.2 million from $23.0 million at September 30, 2023. As we are no longer originating loans under our Home Today program, there is an expected net recovery position for this portfolio which was $2.7 million at September 30, 2024, and $1.2 million at September 30, 2023. Under the CECL methodology, the life of loan concept allows for qualitative adjustments for the expected future recoveries of previously charged-off loans, which is driving the allowance balance for the Home Today loans negative.

of the
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 for more information.
The allowance for credit losses represents the estimate of lifetime loss in our loan portfolio and unfunded loan commitments. Our analysis for evaluating the adequacy of and the appropriateness of our allowance for credit losses is continually refined as relevant information, relating to past events, current conditions and supportable forecasts become available. During the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, no material changes were made to the allowance for credit losses other than the adoption of ASU 2022-02.
Investments
The Association’s Board of Directors is responsible for establishing and overseeing the Association’s investment policy. The investment policy is reviewed at least annually by management and any changes to the policy are recommended to the Board of Directors, or a committee thereof, and are subject to its approval. This policy dictates that investment decisions be made based on the safety of the investment, liquidity requirements, potential returns, the ability to provide collateral for pledging requirements, and consistency with our interest rate risk management strategy. The Association’s Investment Committee, which consists of the Association's CFO, CAO and other members of management, oversees the Association's investing activities and strategies. The portfolio manager is responsible for making securities portfolio decisions in accordance with established policies. The portfolio manager has the authority to purchase and sell securities within specific guidelines established in the investment policy, but historically the portfolio manager has executed purchases only after extensive discussions with other Investment Committee members. All transactions are formally reviewed by the Investment Committee at least quarterly. Any investment which, subsequent to its purchase, fails to meet the guidelines of the policy is reported to the Investment Committee, who decides whether to hold or sell the investment.
The Association’s investment policy requires that the Association invest primarily in debt securities issued by the U.S. Government, agencies of the U.S. Government, and government-sponsored entities, which include Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The policy also permits investments in mortgage-backed securities, including pass-through securities issued and guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae as well as collateralized mortgage obligations and real estate mortgage investment conduits issued or backed by securities issued by these governmental agencies and government-sponsored entities. The investment policy also permits investments in asset-backed securities, banker’s acceptances, money market funds, term federal funds, repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements.
The Association’s investment policy does not permit investment in municipal bonds, corporate debt obligations, preferred or common stock of government agencies or equity securities other than the Association's required investment in the common stock of the FHLB of Cincinnati. As of September 30, 2024, we held no asset-backed securities or securities with sub-prime credit risk exposure, nor did we hold any banker’s acceptances, term federal funds, repurchase agreements or reverse repurchase agreements. As a federal savings association, the Association is not permitted to invest in equity securities. This general restriction does not apply to the Company. The Association’s investment policy permits the use of interest rate agreements (caps, floors and collars) and interest rate exchange contracts (swaps) in managing our interest rate risk exposure. The use of financial futures, however, is prohibited without specific approval from its Board of Directors.
FASB ASC 320, “Investments-Debt and Equity Securities,” requires that, at the time of purchase, we designate a security as held to maturity, available for sale, or trading, depending on our ability and intent. Securities designated as available- for- sale are reported at fair value, while securities designated as held to maturity are reported at amortized cost. As a result of previous guidance from the Company's primary regulator that indicated that the Company's reported balance of liquid assets could not include any investment security not classified as available-for-sale, all investment securities held by the Company are classified as available for sale. We do not have a trading portfolio.

Table of Contents

The fair value of our investment portfolio at September 30, 2024, consisted of $2.9 million in fixed-rate securities guaranteed by Fannie Mae, $449.4 million of REMICs collateralized only by securities guaranteed by Fannie Mae, $1.1 million of securities guaranteed by Freddie Mac and $72.8 million of U.S. Government obligations. 
U.S. Government Obligations.
 While U.S. Government securities generally provide lower yields than other investment options authorized in the Association's and Company's investment policies, we maintain these investments, to the extent appropriate, for liquidity purposes, as collateral for borrowings and interest rate exchange contracts (swaps) and as an interest rate risk hedge in the event of significant mortgage loan prepayments.
Mortgage-Backed Securities.
 We purchase mortgage-backed securities insured or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae. We invest in mortgage-backed securities to achieve positive interest rate spreads with minimal administrative expense, and to lower our credit risk as a result of the guarantees provided by Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae. The U.S. Treasury Department has established financing agreements to ensure that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac meet their obligations to holders of mortgage-backed securities that they have issued or guaranteed.
Mortgage-backed securities are created by the pooling of mortgages and the issuance of a security with an interest rate that is less than the interest rate on the underlying mortgages. Mortgage-backed securities typically represent a participation interest in a pool of single-family or multi-family mortgages, although we invest primarily in mortgage-backed securities backed by one- to four-family mortgages. The issuers of such securities (generally Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) pool and resell the participation interests in the form of securities to investors such as the Association, and guarantee the payment of principal and interest to investors. Mortgage-backed securities generally yield less than the loans that underlie such securities because of the cost of payment guarantees and credit enhancements. However, mortgage-backed securities are more liquid than individual mortgage loans since there is an active trading market for such securities. While there has been significant disruption in the demand for private issuer mortgage-backed securities, the U.S. Treasury support for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guarantees has maintained an orderly market for the mortgage-backed securities the Company typically purchases. In addition, mortgage-backed securities may be used to collateralize our specific liabilities and obligations. Investments in mortgage-backed securities involve a risk that the timing of actual payments will be earlier or later than the timing estimated when the mortgage-backed security was purchased, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such interests, thereby affecting the net yield on our securities. We periodically review current prepayment speeds to determine whether prepayment estimates require modifications that could cause amortization or accretion adjustments.
REMICs are types of debt securities issued by a special-purpose entity that aggregates pools of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities and creates different classes of securities with varying maturities and amortization schedules, as well as a residual interest, with each class possessing different risk characteristics. The cash flows from the underlying collateral are generally divided into “tranches” or classes that have descending priorities with respect to the distribution of principal and interest cash flows, while cash flows on pass-through mortgage-backed securities are distributed pro rata to all security holders.
Sources of Funds
General.
 Deposits traditionally have been the primary source of funds for the Association’s lending and investment activities. The Association also borrows, primarily from the FHLB of Cincinnati, to supplement cash flow, to lengthen the maturities of liabilities for interest rate risk management purposes and to manage its cost of funds. Additional sources of funds are borrowings from the FRB-Cleveland Discount Window, scheduled loan payments, maturing investments, loan prepayments, collateralized wholesale borrowings, Fed Fund purchases, income on other earning assets, the proceeds from loan sales, and brokered deposits. As a result of favorable market conditions, proceeds from loan sales increased during fiscal year 2024 which contributed to the retirement of some FHLB of Cincinnati borrowings.
Deposits.
 The Association obtains deposits primarily from the areas in which its branch offices are located, as well as from its customer service call center, its internet website, and from brokered deposits. It relies on its competitive pricing, convenient locations, and customer service to attract and retain its non-brokered deposits. It offers a variety of retail deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms. Its retail deposit accounts consist of savings accounts, money market accounts, checking accounts, CDs, individual retirement accounts, and other qualified plan accounts. 
Interest rates paid, maturity terms, service fees, and withdrawal penalties are established on a periodic basis. Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on current operating strategies and market interest rates, liquidity requirements, interest rates paid by competitors, and our deposit growth goals.
At September 30, 2024, deposits totaled $10.20 billion. Checking accounts totaled $829.9 million (including $746.4 million of interest-bearing checking accounts) and savings accounts totaled $1.32 billion (including $1.25 billion of higher yield savings accounts and MMKs). At September 30, 2024, the Association had a total of $8.02 billion in CDs (including $1.22 
22
Table of Contents

billion of brokered CDs), of which $4.95 billion had remaining maturities of one year or less. Based on historical experience and its current pricing strategy, management believes the Association will retain a large portion of these balances upon maturity.

Borrowings.
 At September 30, 2024, the Association had $4.79 billion of borrowings outstanding, consisting of $4.77 billion from the FHLB of Cincinnati and $21.3 million of accrued interest. Borrowings from the FHLB of Cincinnati are secured by the Association’s investment in the common stock of the FHLB of Cincinnati as well as by a blanket pledge of its mortgage portfolio not otherwise pledged. Our current, maximum borrowing capacity with the FHLB of Cincinnati is $6.86 billion. The Association also has the ability to purchase overnight Fed Funds up to $395.0 million through arrangements with other institutions. The ability to borrow from the FRB-Cleveland Discount Window is also available to the Association and is secured by a pledge of specific loans in the Association’s mortgage portfolio. At September 30, 2024, the Association had the capacity to borrow up to $633.1 million from the FRB-Cleveland. A maturity schedule and available borrowing capacity schedule can be found in Note

Federal Taxation
General.
 The Company and the Association are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with certain exceptions. Prior to the completion of our initial public stock offering in 2007, the Company and the Association were included as part of Third Federal Savings, MHC’s consolidated tax group. However, upon completion of the offering, the Company and the Association were no longer a part of Third Federal Savings, MHC’s consolidated tax group because Third Federal Savings, MHC no longer owned at least 80% of the common stock of the Company. As a result of the Company's stock repurchase program which reduced the number of outstanding shares of the Company, at September 30, 2024, Third Federal Savings, MHC, owned 80.91% of the common stock of the Company and the Company and the Association can, again, be a part of Third Federal Savings, MHC’s consolidated tax group. Beginning on September 30, 2007 and for each subsequent fiscal year thereafter, the Company has filed consolidated tax returns with the Association and Third Capital Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiaries. 
The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Company or its subsidiaries.
Bad Debt Reserves.
 Historically, the Third Federal Savings, MHC consolidated group used the specific charge-off method to account for bad debt deductions for income tax purposes, and the Company has used and intends to use the specific charge-off method to account for tax bad debt deductions in the future.
Taxable Distributions and Recapture.
 Prior to 1996, bad debt reserves created prior to 1988 were subject to recapture into taxable income if the Association failed to meet certain thrift asset and definitional tests or made certain distributions. Tax law changes in 1996 eliminated thrift-related recapture rules. However, under current law, pre-1988 tax bad debt reserves remain subject to recapture if the Association makes certain non-dividend distributions, repurchases any of its common stock, pays dividends in excess of earnings and profits, or fails to qualify as a bank for tax purposes.
At September 30, 2024, the total federal pre-base year bad debt reserve of the Association was approximately $105.0 million.
State Taxation
Following its initial public stock offering in 2007, the Company converted from a qualified passive investment company domiciled in the State of Delaware to a qualified holding company in Ohio. The Third Federal Savings, MHC consolidated group is subject to the Ohio Financial Institutions Tax. The Financial Institutions Tax is based on total equity capital apportioned to Ohio using a single gross receipts factor. Ohio equity capital is taxed at a three-tiered rate of 0.8% on the first

$200 million, 0.4% on amounts greater than $200 million and less than or equal to $1.3 billion, and 0.25% on amounts greater than $1.3 billion. 
SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
General
The Company is a savings and loan holding company, and is required to file certain reports with, is subject to examination by, and otherwise must comply with the rules and regulations of, the FRS. The Company is also subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC under the federal securities laws.
The Association is a federal savings association that is currently examined and supervised by the OCC and the CFPB, and is subject to examination by the FDIC under certain circumstances. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC’s deposit insurance fund and depositors. Under this system of federal regulation, financial institutions are periodically examined to ensure that they satisfy applicable standards with respect to their capital adequacy, assets, management, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market risk. Following completion of its examination, the federal agency critiques the institution’s operations and assigns its rating (known as an institution’s CAMELS rating). Under federal law, an institution may not disclose its CAMELS rating to the public. The Association also is a member of and owns stock in the FHLB of Cincinnati, which is one of the eleven regional banks in the FHLB System. The OCC will examine the Association and prepare reports for the consideration of the Association’s Board of Directors on any operating deficiencies. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over the Association with respect to consumer protection laws and regulations. The Association’s relationship with its depositors and borrowers also is regulated to a great extent by federal law and, to a much lesser extent, state law, especially in matters concerning the ownership of deposit accounts and the form and content of the Association’s mortgage documents.
Any change in these laws or regulations, whether by the FDIC, OCC, FRS, CFPB or Congress, could have a material impact on the Company, the Association, and their operations.
Certain statutes and regulations that are applicable to the Association and the Company are described below. This description of statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete explanation of such statutes and regulations and their effects on the Association and the Company, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual statutes and regulations.
Federal Banking Regulation
Business Activities.
 A federal savings association derives its lending and investment powers from the HOLA, and federal regulations. Under these laws and regulations, the Association may invest in mortgage loans secured by residential real estate without limitations as a percentage of assets, and may invest in non-residential real estate loans up to 400% of capital in the aggregate. The Association may also invest in commercial business loans up to 20% of assets in the aggregate and consumer loans up to 35% of assets in the aggregate, and in certain types of debt securities and certain other assets. The Association may also establish subsidiaries that may engage in certain activities not otherwise permissible for a federal savings association, including real estate investment and securities and insurance brokerage.
A federal savings association may elect to exercise national bank powers without converting to a national bank charter. Among other things, the election allows a federal savings association to engage in commercial and commercial real estate lending without the aggregate limits applicable to federal savings associations. By exercising the election, the federal savings association also becomes subject to many of the same duties, restrictions, liabilities, conditions and limitations applicable to national banks, some of which are more restrictive than those applicable to federal savings associations. A federal savings association making the election retains its federal savings association charter and continues to be treated as a federal savings association for purposes of corporate governance. The election is available to federal savings associations that had total consolidated assets of $20 billion or less as of December 31, 2017. The Association has not exercised the election as of September 30, 2024.
Capital Requirements.
 Federal regulations require FDIC insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio, a total capital to risk-based assets ratio, and a Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio.
The capital standards require the maintenance of common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, 6% and 8%, respectively, and a leverage ratio of at least 4% Tier 1 capital. Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders’ equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual 
25
Table of Contents

preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for credit losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of AOCI, up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available for sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available for sale-securities). The Association exercised its opt-out election during 2015. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations.
In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one to four- family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans, and a risk weight of between 0% to 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors.
Federal savings associations must also meet a statutory “tangible capital” standard of 1.5% of total adjusted assets. Tangible capital is generally defined as Tier 1 capital for this purpose.
In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% in addition to the minimum capital requirements. At September 30, 2024, the Association exceeded the fully phased in regulatory requirement for the "capital conservation buffer." In assessing an institution’s capital adequacy, the OCC takes into consideration not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where deemed necessary. As presented in Note
 3. REGULATORY MATTERS 
of the
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
, at September 30, 2024, the Association exceeded all regulatory capital requirements to be considered “Well Capitalized.”
Loans-to-One Borrower.
 Generally, a federal savings association may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be loaned, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if the loan is secured by readily marketable collateral, which generally does not include real estate. As of September 30, 2024, the Association was in compliance with the loans-to-one borrower limitations.
Qualified Thrift Lender Test.
 As a federal savings association, the Association must satisfy the qualified thrift lender test. Under the QTL test, the Association must maintain at least 65% of its “portfolio assets” in “qualified thrift investments” (primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including mortgage-backed securities) in at least nine months of the most recent 12-month period. “Portfolio assets” generally means total assets of a federal savings association, less the sum of specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, and the value of property used in the conduct of the federal savings association’s business. 
The Association also may satisfy the QTL test by qualifying as a “domestic building and loan association” as defined in the Internal Revenue Code.
A federal savings association that fails the QTL test must operate under specified restrictions. Under the DFA, non-compliance with the QTL test may subject the Association to agency enforcement action for a violation of law. At September 30, 2024, the Association satisfied the QTL test.
Capital Distributions.
 Federal regulations govern capital distributions by a federal savings association, which include cash dividends, stock repurchases and other transactions charged to the capital account. A federal savings association must file an application with the OCC for approval of a capital distribution if:
•
the total capital distributions for the applicable calendar year exceed the sum of the association’s net income for that year to date plus the association’s retained net income for the preceding two years;
•
the association would not be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution;
•
the distribution would violate any applicable statute, regulation, agreement or condition imposed by a regulator; or
•
the association is not eligible for expedited treatment of its filings.
26
Table of Contents

Regardless of whether an application is required, every federal savings association that is a subsidiary of a holding company must still file a notice with the FRS at least 30 days before the board of directors declares a dividend or approves a capital distribution.
The OCC and the FRS have established similar criteria for approving an application or notice, and may disapprove an application or notice if:
•
the association would be undercapitalized following the distribution;
•
the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns; or
•
the capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation or agreement.
In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that an insured depository institution may not make any capital distribution if the institution would be undercapitalized after the distribution.
The Association, in compliance with the preceding requirements, did not pay a cash dividend to the Company during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, paid a $40 million cash dividend to the Company during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, and a $56 million cash dividend to the Company during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. There were no dividends paid to the Company by Third Capital, the Company's other wholly owned subsidiary, during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 or 2022.
The Company's eighth stock repurchase program, for the repurchase of 10,000,000 shares of its common stock, was announced on October 27, 2016, and began on January 6, 2017. As of September 30, 2024, 5,191,951 shares remain to be purchased under the program. 
Under current FRS regulations, Third Federal Savings, MHC is required to obtain the approval of its members (depositors and certain loan customers of the Association) every 12 months to enable Third Federal Savings, MHC to waive its right to receive dividends on the Company’s common stock that Third Federal Savings, MHC owns. Starting in 2014, Third Federal Savings, MHC has received this approval of its members at every meeting held. Third Federal Savings, MHC has the approval to waive the receipt of dividends up to an aggregate of $1.13 per share on the common stock of the Company for the 12 months following the special meeting of members held on July 9, 2024. Third Federal Savings, MHC waived its right to receive a $0.2825 per share dividend payment on September 24, 2024. As a result of the 2023, 2022, and 2021 approvals, Third Federal Savings, MHC previously waived its right to receive an aggregate of $1.13 per share on common stock for the periods ended June 30, 2024, June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022.
Liquidity.
 A federal savings association is required to identify, measure, monitor and control its funding and liquidity risk and maintain a sufficient amount of liquid assets to ensure its safe and sound operation. The Association maintains a liquid asset portfolio comprised of federal agency and enterprise securities that are collateralized by mortgage loans, in addition to cash and cash equivalents, to maintain sufficient liquidity to fund business operations.
Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws.
 All federal savings associations have a responsibility under the CRA and federal regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. In connection with its examination of a federal savings association, the OCC is required to assess the association’s record of compliance with the CRA. A federal savings association’s failure to comply with the provisions of the CRA could, at a minimum, result in denial of certain corporate applications such as branches, mergers, minority stock offerings or second-step conversion, or in restrictions on its activities. 
In July 2024, the Association received a rating of "Satisfactory" from the OCC for the exam during for the period of January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2022.
On October 24, 2023, the FDIC, the FRS and the OCC released a final rule revising the framework used to evaluate banks' records of community reinvestment under the CRA. Under the revised framework, banks with assets of at least $2 billion, such as the Association, are considered large banks and will have their retail lending, retail services and products, community development financing, and community development services subject to periodic evaluation. Depending on a large bank's geographic concentrations of lending, the evaluation of retail lending may include assessment areas in which the bank extends loans but does not operate any deposit-taking facilities, in addition to assessment areas in which the bank has deposit-taking facilities. Under the rule as written, provisions of the final rule would apply beginning January 1, 2026, and the remaining provisions would apply beginning January 1, 2027, but in March 2024, a federal district court issued a preliminary injunction of the regulations. The Association is evaluating the impact of the final rule.

In addition, the ECOA and FHA prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. The failure to comply with ECOA and FHA could result in enforcement actions by the OCC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and/or the Department of Justice.
Transactions with Affiliates.
 A federal savings association’s authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and its implementing Regulation W. An affiliate includes a company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with an insured depository institution such as the Association. Third Federal Savings, MHC and the Company are affiliates of the Association. In general, specified covered transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates are subject to certain quantitative and collateral requirements. In this regard, covered transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates are limited to 10% of the institution’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus for transactions with any one affiliate and 20% of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus for transactions in the aggregate with all affiliates. Collateral in specified amounts ranging from 100% to 130% of the amount of the transaction must be provided by affiliates in order to receive loans from the insured depository institution. In addition, federal regulations prohibit a federal savings association from lending to any of its affiliates that are engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and from purchasing the securities of any affiliate, other than a subsidiary. Finally, transactions with affiliates must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices, not involve low-quality assets and be on terms that are substantially the same or at least as favorable to the institution as comparable transactions with non-affiliates. Federal savings associations are required to maintain detailed records of all transactions with affiliates.
Extensions of Credit to Insiders.
 The Association’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% shareholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O of the FRS. Among other things, these provisions require that extensions of credit to insiders:
(i)
subject to certain exceptions for loan programs made available to all employees, be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and
(ii)
do not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the Association’s capital.
In addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by the Association’s Board of Directors.
Enforcement.
 The OCC has primary enforcement responsibility over federal savings associations and has the authority to bring enforcement actions against all “institution-affiliated parties,” a term that includes shareholders who participate in the affairs of the association, as well as attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in violations of law or regulation, breaches of fiduciary duty, or unsafe or unsound practices. Formal enforcement actions by the OCC may include issuance of a capital directive, formal agreement, or cease and desist order against institutions, and can also include the removal of officers and/or directors of the institution. Civil money penalties can be assessed for various types of conduct against the institution and/or its officers and directors. The maximum civil money penalties that can be assessed are generally based on the type and severity of the violation, unsafe and unsound practice or other action, and are adjusted annually for inflation. The OCC can appoint receivers and conservators for the institutions it supervises if certain circumstances are met. The FDIC also has the authority to terminate deposit insurance or to recommend to the OCC that an enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular federal savings institution. If action is not taken by the OCC, the FDIC has authority to take action under specified circumstances.
Standards for Safety and Soundness.
 Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository institutions. These standards relate to, among other things, internal controls, information systems, audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation, and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. The federal banking agencies adopted Interagency Guidelines Prescribing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement the safety and soundness standards required under federal law. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. If an institution fails to meet these standards, the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to submit a compliance plan. Failure to implement such a plan can result in further enforcement action, including the issuance of a cease and desist order and/or the imposition of civil money penalties.

Prompt Corrective Action Regulations
.
 Under the prompt corrective action regulations, the OCC is required and authorized to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized federal savings associations. For this purpose, a federal savings association is placed in one of the following five categories based on its capital:
•
well capitalized (at least 5% leverage capital, 8% Tier 1 risk-based capital, 10% total risk-based capital, and 6.5% common equity Tier 1 capital ratios, and is not subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive or prompt corrective action directive issued under certain statutes and regulations, to maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure);
•
adequately capitalized (at least 4% leverage capital, 6% Tier 1 risk-based capital, 8% total risk-based capital and 4.5% common equity Tier 1 capital ratios);
•
undercapitalized (less than 4% leverage capital, 6% Tier 1 risk-based capital, 8% total risk-based capital, or 4.5% common equity Tier 1 capital ratios);
•
significantly undercapitalized (less than 3% leverage capital, 4% Tier 1 risk-based capital, 6% total risk-based capital or 3% common equity Tier 1 capital ratios); and
•
critically undercapitalized (less than or equal to 2% tangible capital to total assets).
Generally, the OCC is required to appoint a receiver or conservator for a federal savings association that is “critically undercapitalized” within specific time frames. The regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the OCC within 45 days of the date a federal savings association receives notice that it is “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” The criteria for an acceptable capital restoration plan include, among other things, the establishment of the methodology and assumptions for attaining adequately capitalized status on an annual basis, procedures for ensuring compliance with restrictions imposed by applicable federal regulations, the identification of the types and levels of activities the federal savings association will engage in while the capital restoration plan is in effect, and assurances that the capital restoration plan will not appreciably increase the current risk profile of the federal savings association. Any holding company for a federal savings association required to submit a capital restoration plan must guarantee the lesser of an amount equal to 5% of the federal savings association’s assets at the time it was notified or deemed to be undercapitalized by the OCC, or the amount necessary to restore the federal savings association to adequately capitalized status. This guarantee remains in place until the OCC notifies the federal savings association that it has maintained adequately capitalized status for each of four consecutive calendar quarters, and the OCC has the authority to require payment and collect payment under the guarantee. Failure by a holding company to provide the required guarantee will result in certain operating restrictions on the federal savings association, such as restrictions on the ability to declare and pay dividends, pay executive compensation and management fees, and increase assets or expand operations. The OCC may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against undercapitalized federal savings associations, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors.
As of September 30, 2024, the Association exceeded all regulatory requirements to be considered “Well Capitalized” as presented in the table below (dollar amounts in thousands).

Insurance of Deposit Accounts.
 The DIF of the FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured depository institutions such as the Association. Deposit accounts in the Association are insured by the FDIC, generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor for each account ownership category. As of September 30, 2024, 96.1% of our $8.98 billion retail deposit base consists of accounts structured under the FDIC insured limit of $250,000.
The FDIC charges insured depository institutions assessments to maintain the DIF. The FDIC bases its assessments on each institution’s total assets less Tier 1 capital, with an assessment schedule based on perceived risk to the DIF. Institutions with over $10 billion of total assets, such as the Association, are classified for assessment purposes as "Large Institutions". Such Large Institutions are generally subject to a pricing system that includes a separate “scorecard” methodology designed to measure risk to the DIF. The assessment range for Large Institutions (inclusive of adjustments specified by the FDIC) is 2.5 to 42 basis points.
On November 16, 2023, the FDIC approved a final rule to implement a special assessment on certain banking organizations with financial institution subsidiaries with more than $5 billion in assets, in order to recover the costs associated 
29
Table of Contents

with protecting uninsured depositors following the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in March 2023. The special assessment will be collected beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2024 at an annual rate of approximately 13.4 basis points for an anticipated total of eight quarterly periods and is subject to periodic adjustments. The assessment base is equal to uninsured deposits reported as of December 31, 2022, adjusted to exclude the first $5 billion. Because the Association's uninsured deposits at the measurement date were below $5 billion, the Association was not subject to this special assessment.
Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. The Association does not believe that it is taking, or is subject to, any action, condition or violation that could lead to termination of its deposit insurance.
Brokered Deposits.
 The FDIA and FDIC regulations generally limit the ability of an insured depository institution to accept, renew or roll-over any brokered deposit unless the institution's capital category is "well capitalized" or, upon application to and a waiver from the FDIC, "adequately capitalized." Less-than-well-capitalized banks are also subject to restrictions on the interest rates that they may pay on deposits. The characterization of deposits as "brokered" may result in the imposition of higher deposit assessments on such deposits. As mandated by the Economic Growth Act, the FDIC's brokered deposit regulations provide a limited exception for reciprocal deposits for banks that are well managed and well capitalized (or adequately capitalized and have obtained a waiver from the FDIC as mentioned above). Under the limited exception, qualified banks are eligible for exemption from treatment as "brokered" deposits up to $5 billion, or 20% of the institution's total liabilities in reciprocal deposits.
Cyber Security.
 The federal banking agencies recently adopted rules providing for new notification requirements for banking organizations and their service providers for significant cybersecurity incidents. Specifically, the new rules require a banking organization to notify its primary federal regulator as soon as possible, and not later than 36 hours after it is determined that a "computer-security incident" rising to the level of a "notification incident" has occurred. Notification is required for incidents that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the viability of a banking organization's operations, its ability to deliver banking products and services, or the stability of the financial sector. Service providers are required under the rule to notify affected banking organization customers as soon as possible when the provider determines that it has experienced a computer-security incident that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the banking organization's customers for four or more hours.
Prohibitions Against Tying Arrangements
.
 Federal savings associations are prohibited, subject to some exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution.
Federal Home Loan Bank System.
 The Association is a member of the FHLB System, which consists of 11 regional FHLBs. The FHLB System provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. As a member of the FHLB of Cincinnati, the Association is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB.
As of September 30, 2024, outstanding borrowings (including accrued interest) from the FHLB of Cincinnati were $4.79 billion and the Association was in compliance with the stock investment requirement.
Other Regulations
Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by the Association are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. The Association’s operations are also subject to federal laws and regulations applicable to credit transactions, such as the:
•
Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;
•
Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;
•
Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, requiring that borrowers for mortgage loans for one- to four-family residential real estate receive various disclosures, including good faith estimates of settlement costs, lender servicing and escrow account practices, and prohibiting certain practices that increase the cost of settlement services;
•
Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit;
•
Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies;
•
Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; and
30
Table of Contents

•
Implementing regulations of the relevant federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws that have supervisory authority over the Association.
The operations of the Association also are subject to:
•
The Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records;
•
The Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services;
•
The Check Clearing for the 21
st
 Century Act (also known as “Check 21”), which gives “substitute checks,” such as digital check images and copies made from those images, the same legal standing as the original paper check;

Loans defined as a "qualified mortgage" must be made to a borrower whose total monthly debt-to-income ratio does not exceed 43%, as well as the verification and documentation of the income and financial resources relied upon to qualify the borrower on the loan. Upon the loan being underwritten based on a fully amortizing payment schedule and maximum interest rate during the first five years, as well as meeting the other qualifications above, the loan is determined to be a "qualified mortgage" and therefore presumed to have complied with the ability-to-repay standard under the DFA.
Holding Company Regulation
General
.
 Third Federal Savings, MHC, and the Company are non-diversified savings and loan holding companies within the meaning of the HOLA. As such, Third Federal Savings, MHC and the Company are registered with the FRS and subject to FRS regulations, examinations, supervision and reporting requirements. In addition, the FRS has enforcement authority over Third Federal Savings, MHC and the Company. Among other things, this authority permits the FRS to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the Association. As federal corporations, Third Federal Savings, MHC and the Company are generally not subject to state business organization laws.
Permitted Activities
.
 Pursuant to Section 10(o) of the HOLA and FRS regulations, a mutual holding company, such as Third Federal Savings, MHC and its mid-tier holding company, the Company, may, with appropriate regulatory approval, engage in the following activities:
(i)
investing in the stock of a savings association;
(ii)
acquiring a mutual association through the merger of such association into a savings association subsidiary of the Company or an interim savings association subsidiary of the Company;
(iii)
merging with or acquiring another holding company, one of whose subsidiaries is a savings association;
(iv)
investing in a corporation, the capital stock of which is available for purchase by a savings association under federal law or under the law of any state where the subsidiary savings association has its home offices;
(v)
furnishing or performing management services for a savings association subsidiary of such company;
(vi)
holding, managing or liquidating assets owned or acquired from a savings association subsidiary of such company;
(vii)
holding or managing properties used or occupied by a savings association subsidiary of such company;
(viii)
acting as trustee under deeds of trust;
(ix)
any other activity:

(B) in which multiple savings and loan holding companies were authorized (by regulation) to directly engage on March 5, 1987;
(x)      if the savings and loan holding company meets the criteria to qualify as a financial holding company, any activity permissible for financial holding companies under Section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act, including securities and insurance underwriting; and
(xi)     purchasing, holding, or disposing of stock acquired in connection with a qualified stock issuance if the purchase of such stock by such savings and loan holding company is approved by the FRS. If a mutual holding company acquires or merges with another holding company, the holding company acquired or the holding company resulting from such merger or acquisition may only invest in assets and engage in activities listed in (i) through (x) above, and has a period of two years to cease any nonconforming activities and divest any nonconforming investments.
The HOLA prohibits a savings and loan holding company, such as the Company, from directly or indirectly acquiring more than 5% of a class of voting securities of, or acquiring "control" as defined in FRS regulations of, another savings institution or savings and loan holding company, without prior written approval of the FRS. It also prohibits the acquisition or retention of, with certain exceptions, more than 5% of a non-subsidiary company engaged in activities other than those permitted by the HOLA or acquiring or retaining control of an institution that is not federally insured. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions, the FRS must consider the financial and managerial resources, future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the DIF, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors.
The FRS is prohibited from approving any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings institutions in more than one state, subject to two exceptions:
(i)
the approval of interstate supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies; and
(ii)
the acquisition of a savings institution in another state if the laws of the state of the target savings institution specifically permit such acquisition.
Capital. 
Consolidated regulatory capital requirements identical to those applicable to the subsidiary depository institutions, including the capital conservation buffer, apply to savings and loan holding companies. We are in compliance with the holding company consolidated capital requirements and the capital conservation buffer as of September 30, 2024.
Dividends

and Repurchases.
 The FRS has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares of common stock by bank holding companies that it has made applicable to savings and loan holding companies as well. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization's capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for prior regulatory review of capital distributions in certain circumstances such as where the company's net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend, the proposed dividend is not covered by earnings for the period for which it is being paid or the company's overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company's capital needs and overall financial condition. The guidance also provides for prior consultation with supervisory staff for material increases in the amount of a company's common stock dividend. The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary depository institution becomes undercapitalized. The policy statement also provides for regulatory review prior to a holding company redeeming or repurchasing regulatory capital instruments when the holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock that would result in a net reduction as of the end of a quarter in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of the Company to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions.
Source of Strength.
 The DFA extended the “source of strength” doctrine, which had traditionally been applicable to bank holding companies, to savings and loan holding companies. FRS regulations require that all savings and loan holding companies serve as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress.
Waivers of Dividends by Third Federal Savings, MHC
.
 Federal regulations require Third Federal Savings, MHC to notify the FRS of any proposed waiver of its receipt of dividends from the Company. In addition, a majority of the mutual holding company’s members eligible to vote must approve a dividend waiver by a mutual holding company within 12 months prior to the declaration of the dividend being waived. Third Federal Savings, MHC received the approval of its members (depositors and certain loan customers of the Association) with respect to the waiver of dividends, and subsequently received the non-objection of the FRB-Cleveland, to waive dividends aggregating up to $1.13 per share on the common stock of the

Company for the 12 months following the special meeting of members held on July 9, 2024. Third Federal Savings, MHC has received the approval of its members every calendar year beginning in 2014.
Conversion of Third Federal Savings, MHC to Stock Form
.
 Federal regulations permit Third Federal Savings, MHC to convert from the mutual form of organization to the capital stock form of organization (a “Conversion Transaction”). In a Conversion Transaction, a new stock holding company would be formed as the successor to the Company, Third Federal Savings, MHC’s corporate existence would end, and certain depositors of the Association would receive the right to subscribe for additional shares of common stock of the new holding company. In a Conversion Transaction, each share of common stock held by stockholders other than Third Federal Savings, MHC (“Minority Stockholders”) would be automatically converted into a number of shares of common stock of the new holding company determined pursuant to an exchange ratio that ensures that Minority Stockholders own the same percentage of common stock in the new holding company as they owned in the Company immediately prior to the Conversion Transaction. Under a provision of the DFA applicable to Third Federal Savings, MHC, Minority Stockholders should not be diluted because of any dividends waived by Third Federal Savings, MHC (and waived dividends should not be considered in determining an appropriate exchange ratio), in the event Third Federal Savings, MHC converts to stock form. Any such Conversion Transaction would require various member and stockholder approvals, as well as regulatory approval.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related regulations address, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. We have prepared policies, procedures and systems designed to ensure compliance with this law and related regulations.
Human Capital Resources
At September 30, 2024, we employed 919 associates, nearly all of whom are full-time and of which approximately 74% are women. At September 30, 2023, we employed 995 associates. As a financial institution, approximately 43% of our associates are employed at our branch and loan production offices, and another 15% are employed at our customer care call center. The success of our business is highly dependent on our associates, who provide value to our customers and communities through their dedication to our mission, helping customers achieve the American dream of home ownership and financial security. Our workplace culture is grounded in a set of core values – love (a genuine concern for others), trust, respect, a commitment to excellence and a little bit of fun – which is lived out daily in our work. We seek to hire well-qualified associates who are also a good fit for our value system. Our selection and promotion processes are without bias and include the active recruitment of minorities and women. 
Associate retention helps us operate efficiently and achieve one of our business objectives, which is being a low-cost provider. Our voluntary turnover rate, at 5.5% for the twelve months ending September 30, 2024, excluding retirements, remains one of the lowest in the industry. At September 30, 2024, 39% of our current associates had been with us for fifteen years or more. We believe our commitment to living out our core values, actively prioritizing concern for our associates’ well-being, supporting our associates’ career goals, offering competitive wages and providing valuable fringe benefits aids in retention of our top-performing associates. In addition, nearly all of our associates are stockholders of the Company through participation in our Associate Stock Ownership Plan, which aligns associate and stockholder interests by providing stock ownership on a tax-deferred basis at no investment cost to our associates.
We encourage and support the growth and development of our associates and, wherever possible, seek to fill positions by promotion and transfer from within the organization. Continual learning and career development is advanced through quarterly performance and development conversations between associates and their managers, internally developed training programs, customized corporate training engagements and educational reimbursement programs. Reimbursement is available to associates enrolled in pre-approved degree or certification programs at accredited institutions that teach skills or knowledge relevant to our business, in compliance with Section 127 of the Internal Revenue Code, and for seminars, conferences, and other training events associates attend in connection with their job duties. 
On an ongoing basis, we further promote the health and wellness of our associates by strongly encouraging work-life balance, offering flexible work schedules, keeping the associate portion of health care premiums to a minimum and sponsoring various wellness programs, whereby associates are compensated for incorporating healthy habits into their daily routines.
