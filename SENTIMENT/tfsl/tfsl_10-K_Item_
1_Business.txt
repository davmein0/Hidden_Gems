Actual loan losses may be significantly more than the allowances we have established, which would have a materially adverse effect on our financial results.
Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
Total assets increased $172.8 million, or 1.0%, to $17.09 billion at September 30, 2024, from $16.92 billion at September 30, 2023. This increase was mainly due to new loan originations exceeding the total of loan sales and principal repayments.
Cash and cash equivalents decreased $3.0 million, or 0.6%, to $463.7 million at September 30, 2024, from $466.7 million at September 30, 2023. Cash is managed to maintain the level of liquidity described later in the

Investment securities increased as $141.7 million in principal repayments were exceeded by the combined effect of $133.5 million in purchases and a $26.1 million decrease in net losses that occurred during the year ended September 30, 2024. There were no sales of investment securities during the year ended September 30, 2024.
Loans held for sale increased $14.5 million, or 439.4%, to $17.8 million at September 30, 2024 from $3.3 million at September 30, 2023 due to an increase in both loans committed to forward sales and loans identified for future sale.
Loans held for investment, net of deferred loan fees and allowance for credit losses, increased $156.3 million, or 1.0%, to $15.32 billion at September 30, 2024, from $15.17 billion at September 30, 2023, as new originations and additional draws on existing accounts exceeded loan sales and repayments. There was an $854.8 million increase in the balance of home equity loans and lines of credit during the year ended September 30, 2024, while residential mortgage loans decreased $698.6 million, or 5.8%, to $11.43 billion at September 30, 2024. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, $157.4 million of three- and five-year “Smart Rate” loans were originated, and $696.8 million of 10-, 15-, and 30-year fixed-rate first mortgage loans were originated or purchased. Of the total $854.2 million in first mortgage loans originated and purchased for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, 7% were refinance transactions and 93% were purchases, while 18% were adjustable-rate mortgages and 82% were fixed-rate mortgages. Fixed-rate loans with terms of 10 years or less accounted for 1% of total first mortgage loan originations and purchases. 
Commitments originated for home equity lines of credit and equity and bridge loans were $2.28 billion for the year ended September 30, 2024, compared to $1.70 billion for the year ended September 30, 2023. At September 30, 2024, pending commitments to originate new home equity lines of credit were $98.2 million and equity and bridge loans were $74.4 million. Refer to the

The amount of FHLB stock owned decreased $18.6 million, or 7.5%, to $228.5 million at September 30, 2024, from $247.1 million at September 30, 2023. FHLB stock ownership requirements dictate the amount of stock owned at any given time.
Total bank owned life insurance contracts increased $5.9 million, to $318.0 million at September 30, 2024, from $312.1 million at September 30, 2023, primarily due to changes in cash surrender value.
Deposits increased $745.3 million, or 7.9%, to $10.20 billion at September 30, 2024, from $9.45 billion at September 30, 2023. The increase in deposits resulted primarily from a $1.37 billion increase in CDs, partially offset by a $469.9 million decrease in savings accounts (consisting of an $153.4 million decrease in money market accounts in the state of Florida and a $332.8 million decrease in our high yield savings accounts) and a $153.5 million decrease in interest-bearing checking accounts. The balance of brokered CDs at September 30, 2024, was $1.22 billion, which is an increase of $54.7 million from the balance of $1.16 billion at September 30, 2023. Based on FDIC insurance limits by ownership structure, the total uninsured deposits were $349.3 million and $322.5 million at September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.
Borrowed funds decreased $480.8 million, or 9.1%, to $4.79 billion at September 30, 2024, from $5.27 billion at September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to borrowings paid off at maturity. The total balance of borrowed funds at September 30, 2024, all from the FHLB, included $40.0 million of overnight advances, $1.81 billion of term advances with a weighted average maturity of approximately 2.0 years, and $2.93 billion of short-term advances aligned with interest rate swap contracts. Interest rate swaps have been used to extend the duration of short-term borrowings at inception by paying a fixed rate of interest and receiving a variable rate. Refer to the

Borrowers' advances for insurance and taxes decreased by $10.8 million, or 9%, to $113.6 million at September 30, 2024, 
from $124.4 million at September 30, 2023. This change is consistent with decreases in our residential mortgage loan portfolio.
Accrued expenses and other liabilities decreased by $15.1 million to $97.8 million at September 30, 2024 from $112.9 million at September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to a $13.2 million deferred tax decrease.

Total shareholders’ equity decreased $64.7 million, or 3.4%, to $1.86 billion at September 30, 2024, from $1.93 billion at September 30, 2023. Activity reflects $79.6 million of net income in the current year, reduced by dividends of $59.0 million and a positive $7.9 million change related to a change in accounting principle. Other changes include a $100.8 million net negative change in accumulated other comprehensive income, primarily related to changes in market values due to fluctuations in market interest rates and maturities of swap contracts, and $7.6 million of positive change related to activity in the Company's stock compensation and employee stock ownership plans. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, no shares were repurchased. The Company's eighth stock repurchase program allows for a total of 10,000,000 shares to be repurchased, with 5,191,951 shares remaining to be repurchased at September 30, 2024. As a result of a mutual member vote, Third Federal Savings and Loan Association of Cleveland, MHC, the mutual holding company that owns approximately 81% of the outstanding stock of the Company, was able to waive receipt of its share of each dividend paid.

Analysis of Net Interest Income
Net interest income represents the difference between the income we earn on our interest-earning assets and the expense we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income depends on the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the rates earned on such assets and the rates paid on such liabilities.
Average balances and yields
.
 The following table sets forth average balances, average yields and costs, and certain other information at and for the fiscal years indicated. No tax-equivalent yield adjustments were made, as the effects thereof were not material. Average balances are derived from daily average balances. Non-accrual loans are included in the computation of loan average balances, but only cash payments received on those loans during the period presented are reflected in the yield. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, deferred expenses, discounts and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or interest expense.

Rate/Volume Analysis.
 The following table presents the effects of changing rates (yields) and volumes (average balances) on our net interest income for the fiscal years indicated. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The net column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately, based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.

Comparison of Operating Results for the Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
General.
 Net income of $79.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2024, increased $4.3 million, compared to $75.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2023. The change was primarily due to lower non-interest expenses and an increase in non-interest income, offset by a decrease in net interest income.
Interest and Dividend Income.
 Interest and dividend income increased $122.2 million, or 20%, to $734.1 million during the year ended September 30, 2024, compared to $611.9 million during the prior year. Interest income on loans increased $98.1 million, or 17%, to $663.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2024, compared to $565.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily attributed to a 50 basis point increase in yield on loans and a $550.2 million increase in the average balance of loans to $15.21 billion for the current year compared to $14.66 billion during the prior year. 
Interest income on interest bearing cash equivalents increased $12.9 million, or 77% to $29.7 million during the current year compared to $16.8 million during the prior year. The increase was attributed to a 68 basis point increase in the average yield, and a $193.1 million increase in the average balance of the interest-bearing cash equivalents to $549.6 million for the current year compared to $356.5 million during the prior year. Additionally, dividend income from FHLB Stock increased $7.4 million, or 49% to $22.5 million in the current year from $15.1 million during the prior year. The increase was attributed mainly to a 268 basis point increase in the average yield on FHLB stock. 
Interest Expense.
 Interest expense increased $127.2 million, or 39%, to $455.6 million during the current year, compared to $328.4 million during the year ended September 30, 2023. The increase primarily resulted from an increase in interest expense on deposits and borrowed funds.
Interest expense on CDs increased $126.8 million, or 88%, to $270.2 million during the year ended September 30, 2024, compared to $143.4 million during the year ended September 30, 2023. The increase was attributed primarily to a 127 basis point increase in the average rate paid on CDs to 3.61% during the current year, from 2.34% during the prior year. Additionally, there was a $1.37 billion, or 22%, increase in the average balance of CDs to $7.49 billion from $6.12 billion during the prior

year as customers sought higher rate products during a period of elevated interest rates. Interest expense on savings and checking accounts decreased $2.5 million and $5.7 million, respectively, to $22.2 million and $0.4 million during the year ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior year largely due to a decrease in the average balance of savings and checking accounts and a net decrease in the average rates paid on checking accounts. 
Interest expense on borrowed funds increased $8.7 million, or 6%, to $162.9 million during the year ended September 30, 2024, from $154.2 million during the year ended September 30, 2023. The increase was attributed to a combination of a $128.6 million, or 3%, decrease in the average balance of borrowed funds to $4.99 billion during the current year, from $5.11 billion during the prior year, and a 26 basis point increase in the average rate paid for these funds to 3.27% during the year ended September 30, 2024, from 3.01% for the year ended September 30, 2023.

Net Interest Income
.
 Net interest income decreased $5.1 million, or 2%, to $278.5 million during the year ended September 30, 2024, from $283.6 million during the year ended September 30, 2023. The decrease consisted of a $127.2 million increase in interest expense, offset by a $122.2 million increase in interest income. Average interest-earning assets increased during the current year by $785.3 million, or 5%, when compared to the year ended September 30, 2023. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $745.0 million. The average yield on interest earning assets increased 55 basis points to 4.44% from 3.89%, compared to a 74 basis point increase in the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities to 3.06% in the current year from 2.32% in the prior year. The interest rate spread was 1.38% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.57% at September 30, 2023. The net interest margin was 1.69% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, and 1.80% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in our interest rate spread and net interest margin is primarily due to the impact of a prolonged period of historically low interest rate environment followed by a rapid and meaningful rise in interest rates, that started in March 2022, along with an extended period of yield curve inversion.

Provision (Release) for Credit Losses
.
 We recorded a release of the allowance for credit losses of $1.5 million during each of the years ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. As delinquencies in the portfolio are resolved through pay-off, short sale or foreclosure, or management determines the collateral is not sufficient to satisfy the loan, uncollected balances have been charged against the allowance for credit losses previously provided. Recoveries of amounts charged against the allowance for credit losses occur when collateral values increase and homes are sold or when borrowers repay the amounts previously charged-off. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, we recorded net recoveries of $4.7 million, as compared to net recoveries of $6.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2023. Credit loss provisions (releases) are recorded with the objective of aligning our allowance for credit loss balances with our current estimates of loss in the portfolio. Refer to the

Non-Interest Income.
 Non-interest income increased $3.3 million, or 15%, to $24.7 million during the year ended September 30, 2024, compared to $21.4 million during the year ended September 30, 2023. The increase in non-interest income was primarily due to increases in net gain on sale of loans of $2.2 million during the year ended September 30, 2024. Loans sold, or committed to be sold, during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, were $247.4 million compared to loan sales of $77.2 million during the year ended September 30, 2023. 
Non-Interest Expense.
 Non-interest expense decreased $8.8 million, or 4%, to $204.3 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, compared to $213.1 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. This decrease resulted primarily from a $5.0 million and $5.6 million decrease in salary and employee benefits and marketing expenses, respectively, due to cost containment measures implemented as a result of the challenging interest rate environment. 
Income Tax Expense.
 The provision for income taxes was $20.7 million during the year ended September 30, 2024, compared to $18.1 million during the year ended September 30, 2023. The provision for the current year included $18.8 million of federal income tax provision and $1.9 million of state income tax provision. The provision for the year ended September 30, 2023, included $17.3 million of federal income tax provision and $0.8 million of state income tax provision. Our combined effective tax rate was 20.7% during the year ended September 30, 2024, and 19.4% during the year ended September 30, 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short-term nature. Our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows, loan repayments, advances from the FHLB of Cincinnati, borrowings from the FRB-Cleveland 
59
Table of Contents

Discount Window, overnight Fed Funds through various arrangements with other institutions, proceeds from brokered CDs transactions, principal repayments and maturities of securities, and sales of loans.
In addition to the primary sources of funds described above, we have the ability to obtain funds through the use of collateralized borrowings in the wholesale markets, and from sales of securities. Also, debt issuance by the Company and access to the equity capital markets via a supplemental minority stock offering or a full conversion (second-step) transaction remain as other potential sources of liquidity, although these channels generally require up to nine months of lead time.
While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by interest rates, economic conditions and competition. The Association’s Investment Committee is responsible for establishing and monitoring our liquidity targets and strategies in order to ensure that sufficient liquidity exists for meeting the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawals of our customers as well as unanticipated contingencies. We generally seek to maintain a minimum liquidity ratio of 5% (which we compute as the sum of cash and cash equivalents plus unencumbered investment securities for which ready markets exist, divided by total average assets). For the year ended September 30, 2024, the liquidity ratio averaged 5.95% for the Association. We believe that we had sufficient sources of liquidity to satisfy our short- and long-term liquidity needs as of September 30, 2024.
We regularly adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of expected loan demand, expected deposit flows, yields available on interest-earning deposits and securities, scheduled liability maturities and the objectives of our asset/liability management program. Excess liquid assets are generally invested in interest-earning deposits and short- and intermediate-term securities.
Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. At September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled $463.7 million, which represented a decrease of 0.64% from September 30, 2023.
Investment securities classified as available for sale, which provide additional sources of liquidity, totaled $526.3 million at September 30, 2024.
During the year ended September 30, 2024, loan sales, including commitments to sell, totaled $247.4 million, which included sales to Fannie Mae consisting of $215.6 million of long-term, fixed-rate, agency-compliant, non-Home Ready first mortgage loans and $31.8 million of loans that qualified under Fannie Mae's Home Ready initiative. At September 30, 2024, $17.8 million of long-term, fixed-rate residential first mortgage loans were classified as "held for sale". 
Our cash flows are derived from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities as reported in our 
CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS
 included in the 
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
.
At September 30, 2024, we had $248.0 million in outstanding commitments to originate loans. In addition to commitments to originate loans, we had $5.22 billion in unfunded home equity lines of credit to borrowers. CDs due within one year of September 30, 2024, totaled $4.95 billion, or 48.6% of total deposits. If these deposits do not remain with us, we will be required to seek other sources of funds, including loan sales, sales of investment securities, other deposit products, including new CDs and brokered CDs, FHLB advances, borrowings from the FRB-Cleveland Discount Window or other collateralized borrowings. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the CDs due on or before September 30, 2025. We believe, however, based on past experience, that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us. Generally, we have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered.
Our primary investing activities are originating residential mortgage loans, home equity loans and lines of credit and purchasing investments. During the year ended September 30, 2024, we originated $854.2 million of residential mortgage loans, and $2.28 billion of commitments for home equity loans and lines of credit, while during the year ended September 30, 2023, we originated $1.86 billion of residential mortgage loans and $1.70 billion of commitments for home equity loans and lines of credit. We purchased $133.5 million of securities during the year ended September 30, 2024, and $144.7 million during the year ended September 30, 2023. Also, during the years ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we purchased $308.9 million and $279.2 million of long-term, fixed-rate first mortgage loans.
Financing activities consist primarily of changes in deposit accounts, changes in the balances of principal and interest owed on loans serviced for others, FHLB advances, including any collateral requirements related to interest rate swap agreements and borrowings from the FRB-Cleveland Discount Window. We experienced a net increase in total deposits of $745.3 million during the year ended September 30, 2024 compared to a net increase of $520.0 million during the year ended September 30, 2023. Deposit flows are affected by the overall level of interest rates, the interest rates and products offered by us and our local competitors, and by other factors. During the year ended September 30, 2024, there was a $54.7 million 
60
Table of Contents

increase in the balance of brokered CDs (exclusive of acquisition costs and subsequent amortization), which had a balance of $1.22 billion at September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2023, the balance of brokered CDs was $1.16 billion. Principal and interest received on loans serviced for others and owed to investors experienced a net decrease of $1.0 million to $28.8 million during the year ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net decrease of $0.1 million to $29.8 million during the year ended September 30, 2023. During the year ended September 30, 2024, we decreased our borrowed funds by $480.8 million to manage future interest costs and to actively manage our liquidity ratio.
Liquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of business management. If we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally, borrowing agreements exist with the FHLB of Cincinnati, the FRB-Cleveland Discount Window, and arrangements with other institutions to purchase overnight Fed Funds, each of which provides an additional source of funds. On December 19, 2023, the FHLB of Cincinnati, subsequent to revising their Credit Policy Manual in September 2023 to decrease the allowable borrowing limit from 50% to 40% of total assets, approved an exception to increase the Association's allowable borrowing limit to 45% of total assets. The exception requires the Association to maintain compliance with certain credit and regulatory criteria. In an effort to manage our available borrowing capacity with the FHLB, the Company has replaced a portion of its 90-day FHLB advances with like-term brokered deposits. 
On July 8, 2024, the Association received a rating of "Satisfactory" on its CRA exam covering the period ended December 31, 2022. As a result, on July 22, 2024, the Association was notified that it is now compliant with the FHFA's Community Support Regulation, has regained access to long-term advances (advances with a term greater than one year) from the FHLB of Cincinnati and is eligible for participation in the FHLB's Affordable Housing Program or other Community Investment Cash Advance programs. 
At September 30, 2024, we had $4.77 billion of FHLB of Cincinnati advances, no outstanding borrowings from the FRB-Cleveland Discount Window and no outstanding borrowings in the form of Fed Funds. Additionally, at September 30, 2024, we had $1.22 billion of brokered CDs. During the year ended September 30, 2024, we had average outstanding borrowed funds of $4.99 billion, as compared to $5.11 billion during the year ended September 30, 2023. Refer to the

for further discussion.
The Association and the Company are subject to various regulatory capital requirements, including a risk-based capital measure. The Basel III capital framework for U.S. banking organizations ("Basel III Rules") includes both a revised definition of capital and guidelines for calculating risk-weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet items to broad risk categories. 
In 2019, a final rule adopted by the federal banking agencies provided banking organizations with the option to phase in, over a three-year period, the adverse day-one regulatory capital effects of the adoption of the CECL accounting standard. In 2020, as part of its response to the impact of COVID-19, U.S. federal banking regulatory agencies issued a final rule which provides banking organizations that implement CECL during the 2020 calendar year the option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL’s effect on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology’s effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period, which the Association and Company have adopted. During the two-year delay, the Association and Company added back to CET1, 100% of the initial adoption impact of CECL plus 25% of the cumulative quarterly changes in the allowance for credit losses. 
Beginning fiscal year 2023, the cumulative transitional amounts became fixed and are being phased out of CET1 capital ratably over three years.
The Association is subject to the "capital conservation buffer" requirement level of 2.5%. The requirement limits capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a "capital conservation buffer" in addition to the minimum capital requirements. At September 30, 2024, the Association exceeded the regulatory requirement for the "capital conservation buffer" and all regulatory capital requirements to be considered "Well Capitalized".
In addition to the operational liquidity considerations described above, which are primarily those of the Association, the Company, as a separate legal entity, also monitors and manages its own, parent company-only liquidity, which provides the source of funds necessary to support all of the parent company's stand-alone operations, including its capital distribution strategies which encompass its share repurchase and dividend payment programs. The Company's primary source of liquidity is dividends received from the Association. The amount of dividends that the Association may declare and pay to the Company in any calendar year, without the receipt of prior approval from the OCC but with prior notice to the FRB-Cleveland, cannot exceed net income for the current calendar year-to-date period plus retained net income (as defined) for the preceding two calendar years, reduced by prior dividend payments made during those periods. The Company did not receive a cash dividend from the Association in December 2023. Because of its intercompany nature, this dividend payment would not have had an impact on the Company's capital ratios or its consolidated statement of condition but would have reduced the Association's 
61
Table of Contents

reported capital ratios. At September 30, 2024, the Company had, in the form of cash and a demand loan from the Association, $126.2 million of funds readily available to support its stand-alone operations. 
The Company’s eighth stock repurchase program, which authorized the repurchase of up to 10,000,000 shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock was approved by the Board of Directors on October 27, 2016, and repurchases began on January 6, 2017. There were 4,808,049 shares repurchased under that program between its start date and September 30, 2024. During the year ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock. 
The payment of dividends, support of asset growth and strategic stock repurchases are planned for the future as the focus for future capital deployment activities. Third Federal Savings, MHC has the approval of its members to waive dividends aggregating up to $1.13 per share on the common stock of the Company for the 12 months following the special meeting of members held on July 9, 2024, and subsequently received the non-objection from the FRB. 
Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices
Our consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations. Unlike industrial companies, our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature. As a result, changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than the effects of inflation.

Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
General
.
 The majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. Consequently, our most significant form of market risk has historically been interest rate risk. In general, our assets, consisting primarily of mortgage loans, have longer maturities than our liabilities, consisting primarily of deposits and advances from the FHLB of Cincinnati. As a result, a fundamental component of our business strategy is to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates. Accordingly, our Board of Directors has established risk parameter limits deemed appropriate given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives.

Additionally, our Board of Directors has authorized the formation of an Asset/Liability Management Committee comprised of key operating personnel, which is responsible for managing this risk in a manner that is consistent with the guidelines and risk limits approved by the Board of Directors.

Further, the Board has established the Director's Risk Committee, which, among other responsibilities, conducts regular oversight and review of the guidelines, policies and deliberations of the Asset/Liability Management Committee. We manage our interest rate risk in order to control the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates. Refer to the 
Overview 
section of 
Item 7 
for additional discussion on how we manage interest rate risk. 
Economic Value of Equity
.
 Using customized modeling software, the Company and Association prepare periodic estimates of the amounts by which the net present value of cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items (the institution’s economic value of equity or EVE) would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates. The simulation model uses a discounted cash flow analysis and an option-based pricing approach in measuring the interest rate sensitivity of EVE. The model estimates the economic value of each type of asset, liability and off-balance sheet contract under the assumption that instantaneous changes (measured in basis points) occur at all maturities along the United States Treasury yield curve and other relevant market interest rates. A basis point equals one, one-hundredth of one percent, and 100 basis points equals one percent. The model is tailored specifically to our organization, which, we believe, improves its predictive accuracy. Computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions, including relative levels of market interest rates, loan prepayments and deposit decay, and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results.
The manner in which actual yields, costs and consumer behavior respond to changes in market interest rates may vary from the inherent methodologies used to measure interest rate risk through changes in EVE. In this regard, our EVE estimates assume:
•
no new growth or business volumes;
•
that the composition of our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured, except for reductions to reflect mortgage loan principal repayments along with modeled prepayments and defaults, and deposit decays; and
62
Table of Contents

•
that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. 
Our simulation model possesses random patterning capabilities and accommodates extensive regression analytics applicable to the prepayment and decay profiles of our borrower and depositor portfolios. The model facilitates the generation of alternative modeling scenarios and provides us with timely decision making data that is integral to our IRR management processes. Modeling our IRR profile and measuring our IRR exposure are processes that are subject to continuous revision, refinement, modification, enhancement, back testing and validation. We continually evaluate, challenge and update the methodology and assumptions used in our IRR model, including behavioral equations that have been derived based on third-party studies of our customers' historical performance patterns. Changes to the methodology and/or assumptions used in the model will result in reported IRR profiles and reported IRR exposures that will be different, and perhaps significantly, from the results reported below.
Net Interest Income.
 In addition to EVE calculations, we use our simulation model to analyze the sensitivity of our net interest income to changes in interest rates (the institution’s NII). Net interest income is the difference between the interest income that we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest that we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. In our model, we estimate what our net interest income would be for prospective 12 and 24 month periods using customized (based on our portfolio characteristics) assumptions with respect to loan prepayment rates, default rates and deposit decay rates, and the implied forward yield curve as of the market date for assumptions related to projected interest rates. We then calculate what the estimated net interest income would be for the same period under numerous interest rate scenarios.

The simulation process is subject to continual enhancement, modification, refinement and adaptation. The Company and Association use a "ramped" assumption in preparing the NII sensitivity simulation estimates for us in its public disclosure. The "ramped" assumption calculates NII sensitivity in the event that the market interest rates used in the simulation were adjusted in incremental amounts during the 12 month measurement period.
The manner in which actual yields, costs and consumer behavior respond to changes in market interest rates may vary from the inherent methodologies used to measure interest rate risk through NII. In this regard, the interest rate risk information presented below assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although interest rate risk calculations provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and will differ from actual results. In addition to the preparation of computations as described above, we also formulate simulations based on a variety of non-linear changes in interest rates and a variety of non-constant balance sheet composition scenarios.
Other Considerations. 
The EVE and NII sensitivity analyses are similar in that they both start with the same month end balance sheet amounts, weighted average coupon and maturity. The underlying prepayment, decay and default assumptions are also the same and they both start with the same month end "markets" (Treasury and FHLB yield curves, etc.). From that similar starting point, the models follow divergent paths. EVE is a stochastic model using 150 different interest rate paths to compute market value at the account level for each of the categories on the balance sheet whereas NII uses the implied forward curve to compute interest income/expense at the account level for each of the categories on the balance sheet. 
EVE is considered as a point in time calculation with a "liquidation" view of the Company and Association where all the cash flows (including interest, principal and prepayments) are modeled and discounted using discount factors derived from the current market yield curves. It provides a long-term view and helps to define changes in equity and duration as a result of changes in interest rates. On the other hand, NII is based on balance sheet projections going one year and two years forward and assumes new business volume and pricing to calculate net interest income under different interest rate environments. NII sensitivity is calculated to determine the sensitivity of net interest income under different interest rate scenarios. With each of these models, specific policy limits have been established for the Association that are compared with the actual month end results. These limits have been approved by the Association's Board of Directors and are used as benchmarks to evaluate and moderate interest rate risk. In the event that there is a breach of policy limits that extends beyond two consecutive quarter end measurement periods, management is responsible for taking such action, similar to those described under the preceding heading of 
General
, as may be necessary in order to return the Association's interest rate risk profile to a position that is in compliance with the policy.

Accordingly, although the EVE presented in the tables above provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure as of the indicated dates, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our EVE and will differ from actual results. In addition to our core business activities, which seek to originate Smart Rate (adjustable) loans, home equity lines of credit (adjustable) and 10-year fixed-rate loans funded by borrowings from the FHLB and intermediate term CDs (including brokered CDs), and which are intended to have a favorable impact on our IRR profile, the impact of several other items and events resulted in an improvement in the Pre-Shock EVE (base valuation) of 4.54% and 9.73% at September 30, 2024, when compared to the measures at September 30, 2023, for the Company and Association, respectively. Factors contributing to the Association's improvement included decrease in market interest rates, capital actions by the Association, and changes due to business activity. While our core business activities, as described at the beginning of this paragraph, are generally intended to have a positive impact on our IRR profile, the actual impact is determined by a number of factors, including the pace of mortgage asset additions (reductions) to our balance sheet (including consideration of outstanding commitments to originate those assets), in comparison to the pace of the addition (reduction) of duration extending funding sources.

Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Under the supervision of and with the participation of the Company’s management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons 
65
Table of Contents

performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Management’s Report Regarding Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such terms are defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act of 1934. Our system of internal controls is designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements that we provide to the public are fairly presented.
Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets, (ii) provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Accordingly, absolute assurance cannot be provided that the effectiveness of the internal control systems may not become inadequate in future periods because of changes in conditions, or because the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. In making this assessment, the criteria set forth by the COSO in 
Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)
 was utilized. Management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2024, based on those criteria.
The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 302 Certifications have been filed as Exhibit 31.1 and Exhibit 31.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of TFS Financial Corporation 
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of TFS Financial Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2024, of the Company and our report dated November 21, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion 
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report Regarding Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of TFS Financial Corporation
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of condition of TFS Financial Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 21, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Allowance for Credit Losses – Refer to Notes 1 and 5 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) is management’s estimate of expected credit losses in the loan portfolio, including off-balance sheet commitments. As discussed in Notes 1 and 5 of the consolidated financial statements, the ACL is an amount which represents management’s best estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual life of the Company’s loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The ACL for the loan portfolio is comprised of quantitative general valuation allowances for credit losses based on historical loan loss, and qualitative adjustments to the quantitative general valuation allowances to cover uncertainties that affect the estimate of expected credit losses. The ACL for off-balance sheet commitments is comprised of expected lifetime losses on unfunded loan commitments to extend credit where the obligations are not unconditionally cancellable.
As of September 30, 2024, the Company’s loan portfolio totaled $15.3 billion, and the related ACL was $70.0 million. The Company’s off-balance sheet commitments totaled $5.4 billion, and the related ACL was $27.8 million. The ACL is established using relevant available information, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company utilizes loan level regression models with forecasted economic data to derive the probability of default and loss given default factors. These factors are used to calculate the loan level credit loss over a 24-month reasonable and supportable period with an immediate reversion to historical mean loss rates for the remaining life of the loans. Qualitative adjustments are then made to account for factors that management does not believe are captured in the Current Expected Credit Losses (“CECL”) quantitative models. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for the loan portfolio inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires significant estimates of current credit risks using both quantitative and qualitative analyses.

Table of Contents

Auditing certain aspects of the ACL, including the (1) model methodology, (2) model accuracy, (3) model assumptions, (4) interpretation of the results, and (5) use of qualitative adjustments, involves especially subjective and complex judgment. Given the significant judgment in determining the ACL estimate, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimate of the ACL requires a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our credit specialists.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the Allowance for Credit Losses included the following, among others: 
•
We tested the effectiveness of controls over the Company’s (1) model methodology, (2) model accuracy, (3) model assumptions, (4) interpretation of the results, and (5) use of qualitative adjustments.
•
With the assistance of our credit specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the (1) model methodology, (2) model accuracy, (3) model assumptions, and (4) interpretation of the results.
•
We evaluated trends in the total ACL for consistency with trends in loan portfolio growth and credit performance.
•
We tested the accuracy and completeness of key risk characteristics input into the model by agreeing to source information.
•
We assessed the Company’s method for determining the qualitative factor adjustments and the effect of those factors on the ACL compared with relevant credit risk factors and credit trends.

TFS FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
As of and for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022 
(Dollars in thousands unless otherwise indicated)
1. 
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Business
—TFS Financial Corporation, a federally chartered stock holding company, conducts its principal activities through its wholly owned subsidiaries. The principal line of business of the Company is retail consumer banking, including mortgage lending, deposit gathering, and other financial services. Third Federal Savings and Loan Association of Cleveland, MHC, its federally chartered mutual holding company parent, owned 
80.91
% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company at September 30, 2024.
The Company’s primary operating subsidiaries include the Association and Third Capital, Inc. The Association is a federal savings association which provides retail loan and savings products to its customers in Ohio and Florida through its 
37
 full-service branches, 
two
 loan production offices, customer service call center and internet site. The Association also provides savings products, purchase mortgages, first mortgage refinance loans, home equity lines of credit, and home equity loans in states outside of its branch footprint. The Association also acquires first mortgage loans through a correspondent lending partnership. Third Capital, Inc. was formed to hold non-thrift investments and subsidiaries. 
The accounting and reporting policies of TFS Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and to general practices within the banking industry. 
No material subsequent events have occurred requiring recognition in the consolidated financial statements or disclosure in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. 
The following is a description of the significant accounting and reporting policies which the Company follows in preparing and presenting its consolidated financial statements.
Basis of Consolidation and Reporting
—The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of TFS Financial Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Estimates
—The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
—Cash and cash equivalents consist of working cash on hand, and demand and interest-bearing deposits at other financial institutions with maturities of three months or less. For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents also includes federal funds sold, when applicable. The Company has acknowledged informal agreements with banks where it maintains deposits. Under these agreements, service fees charged to the Company are waived provided certain average compensating balances are maintained throughout each month.
Investment Securities
—Our fixed-maturity securities are accounted for on an available-for-sale basis. Securities held as available-for-sale are reported at fair value, with the corresponding unrealized gains and (losses), net of deferred income taxes, reported in AOCI. Management determines the appropriate classification of investment securities based on its intent and ability to hold at the time of purchase. Purchases of securities are accounted for on a trade-date or settlement-date basis, depending on the settlement terms.
Realized gains and (losses) on securities are computed on a specific identification basis. Realized gains and (losses) also include changes in fair value on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments. Sales of securities are accounted for on a trade-date or settlement-date basis, depending on the settlement terms.
A decline in the fair value of any available for sale security, below cost, is evaluated for credit loss. Credit loss is recognized in earnings if management intends, or will more likely than not be required, to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis of the security, then a credit loss exists and an allowance would be recognized as a credit loss expense, limited to the difference between fair value and amortized cost. Non-credit related loss is recognized in OCI, net of applicable deferred income taxes.
To determine whether a credit loss exists, the Company considers, among other things, adverse conditions related to the security, industry, geographic area, the payment schedule of the debt security and likelihood that the issuer will be able to make 
79
Table of Contents

payments that increase in the future, failure of the issuer to make scheduled payments and all available information relevant to the securities collectability, changes in ratings assigned by a rating agency, and other credit enhancements that affect the securities expected performance. 
Investment income consist of interest and accretion (net of amortization). Interest is recognized on an accrual basis using the level-yield method. Premiums and discounts are amortized using the level-yield method.
Derivative Instruments
—Derivative instruments are carried at fair value in the Company's financial statements. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are reported as a component of OCI, net of tax, and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The earnings effect of the hedging instrument will be presented in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item. AOCI will be adjusted to a balance that reflects the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedging instrument. At the inception of a hedge, the Company documents certain items, including the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, the risk management objective and the nature of the risk being hedged, a description of how effectiveness will be measured, an evaluation of hedge transaction effectiveness and the benchmark interest rate or contractually specified interest rate being hedged.
Hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when (1) a derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flow of a hedged item, (2) a derivative expires or is sold, (3) a derivative is de-designated as a hedge because it is unlikely that a forecasted transaction will occur, or (4) it is determined that designation of a derivative as a hedge is no longer appropriate. When hedge accounting is discontinued, the Company would continue to carry the derivative on the statement of condition at its fair value; however, changes in its fair value would be recorded in earnings instead of through OCI.
For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, the Company recognizes gains and (losses) on the derivative instrument in current earnings during the period of change.
Mortgage Banking Activity
—Mortgage loans originated or purchased and intended for sale in the secondary market are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value in the aggregate. Mortgage loans included in pending agency contracts to sell and securitize loans are carried at fair value. Fair value is based on quoted secondary market pricing for loan portfolios with similar characteristics and includes consideration of deferred fees (costs). Net unrealized gains or losses on loans carried at fair value are recognized in a valuation allowance by charges to income.
The Company has retained servicing on loans that are sold and initially recognizes an asset for mortgage loan servicing rights based on the fair value of the servicing rights. Residential mortgage loans represent the single class of servicing rights and are measured at the lower of cost or fair value on a recurring basis. Mortgage loan servicing rights are reported net of accumulated amortization, which is recorded in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing revenues. The Company monitors prepayments and changes amortization of mortgage servicing rights accordingly. Fair values are estimated using discounted cash flows based on current interest rates and prepayment assumptions, and impairment is monitored each quarterly reporting period. The impairment analysis is based on predominant risk characteristics of the loans serviced, such as type, fixed- and adjustable-rate loans, original terms and interest rates. The amount of impairment recognized is the amount by which the mortgage loan servicing assets exceed their fair value. 
Servicing fee income net of amortization and other loan fees collected on loans serviced for others are included in Fees and service charges, net of amortization on the 
CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME
.
Loans and Related Deferred Loan Expenses, net
—Loans originated or purchased with the intent to hold into the foreseeable future are carried at unpaid principal balances adjusted for partial charge-offs, the allowance for credit losses and net deferred loan expenses. Interest on loans is accrued and credited to income as earned. Interest on loans is not recognized in income when collectability is uncertain. 
Loan fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred and recognized as an adjustment to interest income using the level-yield method over the contractual lives of related mortgage loans, if the loans are held for investment. If the loans are held for sale, net deferred fees (costs) are generally not amortized, but rather are recognized when the related loans are sold. Equity lines of credit amortize net deferred fees (costs) on a straight-line basis generally over the draw period.
A modification granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty is defined as an agreement in which, for economic reasons related to a borrower’s financial difficulties, a more than insignificant concession is granted to the borrower that would not otherwise be available. The modifications to the payment terms of a loan may include interest rate reductions, term extensions, significant payment delays or, other, or a combination thereof.
Allowance for Credit Losses
—The allowance for credit losses represents the estimate of lifetime losses in our loan portfolio and off-balance sheet commitments. The allowance for credit losses is assessed on a quarterly basis and provisions 
80
Table of Contents

(releases) for credit losses are made accordingly. The allowance is established using relevant available information, relating to past events, current conditions and supportable economic forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Qualitative adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency status or likely recovery of previous loan charge-offs. The allowance for credit losses is increased by recoveries and decreased by charge-offs. Also, qualitative adjustments were made to reflect expected recovery of loan amounts previously charged-off, beyond what the model is able to project. 
For further discussion on the allowance for credit losses, non-accrual, and modifications, see Note
 5. LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES 
and Note 
15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES 
of the 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
.
Real Estate Owned, net
—Real estate owned, net represents real estate acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure and is initially recorded at fair value, less estimated costs to sell. Subsequent to acquisition, real estate owned is carried at the lower of cost or fair value, less estimated selling costs. Management performs periodic valuations and a valuation allowance is established by a charge to income for any excess of the carrying value over the fair value, less estimated costs to sell the property. Recoveries in fair value during the holding period are recognized until the valuation allowance is reduced to zero. Costs related to holding and maintaining the property are charged to expense.
Premises, Equipment, and Software, net
—Depreciation and amortization of premises, equipment and software is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Estimated lives are 
31.5
 years for office facilities and 
three
 to 
10
 years for equipment and software. Amortization of leasehold or building improvements is computed on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the economic useful life of the improvement or term of the lease, typically 
10
 years.
Leases
—At inception, all contracts are evaluated to determine if the arrangement contains a lease based on the terms and conditions. As a lessee, the Company recognizes leases with terms greater than one year on the 
CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CONDITION
 as lease assets (a right-of-use asset) and lease liabilities (a liability to make lease payments), measured on a discounted basis. For further discussion on leases, see Note 
8.

LEASES
.
Bank Owned Life Insurance Contracts
—Life insurance is provided under both whole and split dollar life insurance agreements. Policy premiums were prepaid and the Company will recover the premiums paid from the proceeds of the policies. The Company recognizes death benefits and growth in the cash surrender value of the policies in other non-interest income.
Goodwill
—The excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets of acquired companies is classified as goodwill and reported in Other Assets. Goodwill was $
9,732
 at September 30, 2024 and 2023. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis as of September 30. 
No
 impairment was identified as of September 30, 2024 or 2023.
Taxes on Income
—Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Additional information about policies related to income taxes is included in Note
 12. INCOME TAXES
.
Deposits
—Interest on deposits is accrued and charged to expense monthly and is paid or credited in accordance with the terms of the accounts.
Treasury Stock—
Acquisitions of treasury stock through stock repurchases are recorded at cost using the cost method of accounting. Repurchases may be made through open market purchases, block trades and in negotiated private transactions, subject to the availability of stock, general market conditions, the trading price of the stock, alternative uses for capital, and the Company’s financial performance. Repurchased shares will be available for general corporate purposes.
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)
—AOCI consists of changes in pension obligations, changes in unrealized gains (losses) on securities available for sale and cash flow hedges, each of which is net of the related income tax effects. The Company's policy is to release income tax effects from AOCI only when the entire portfolio to which the underlying transactions relate to is liquidated, sold or extinguished.
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
—The core principle of the guidance requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Three of the Company's revenue streams within scope of Topic 
81
Table of Contents

606 are the sales of REO, interchange income, and deposit account and other transaction-based service fee income. Those streams are immaterial and therefore quantitative information regarding these streams is not disclosed.
Pension Benefits
—The determination of our obligations and expense for pension benefits is dependent upon certain assumptions used in calculating such amounts. Key assumptions used in the actuarial valuations include the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Actual results could differ from the assumptions and market driven rates may fluctuate. Significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in the assumptions could materially affect future pension obligations and expense.
Share-Based Compensation
—Compensation expense for awards of equity instruments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 718 “Compensation—Stock Compensation.” All vested equity instruments are settled in stock. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur. Share-based compensation expense is included in Salaries and employee benefits in the 
CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME
. Tax benefits or deficiencies recognized for the difference between realized deductions and cumulative book compensation cost on share-based compensation awards are included in operating cash flows on the 
CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOW
. 
The grant date fair value of stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model using assumptions for the expected option term, expected stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividend yield. The simplified method is used to estimate expected term of "plain vanilla" options when the Company's historical experience does not provide a reasonable basis for the estimate.
Marketing Costs
—Marketing costs are expensed as incurred.
Earnings per Share
—Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Outstanding shares include shares sold to subscribers, shares held by the Third Federal Foundation, shares of the Employee Stock Ownership Plan which have been allocated or committed to be released for allocation to participants, and shares held by Third Federal Savings, MHC. Unvested shares awarded in the Company's share-based compensation plan are treated as participating securities for purposes of the two-class method when they contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends, but are not included in the number of shares in the computation of basic EPS. The two-class method is an earnings allocation that determines EPS for each class of common stock and participating security. 
Diluted EPS is computed using the same method as basic EPS, but the weighted-average number of shares reflects the potential dilution, if any, of unexercised stock options, unvested shares of performance share units and unvested shares of restricted stock units that could occur if stock options were exercised and performance share units and restricted stock units were issued and converted into common stock. These potentially dilutive shares would then be included in the number of weighted-average shares outstanding for the period using the treasury stock method. At September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, potentially dilutive shares include stock options, restricted stock units and performance share units issued through share-based compensation plans.

REGULATORY MATTERS
The Association is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the financial statements of the Association. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Association must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of its assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors.
Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Association to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in table below) of Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1, and Total Capital (as defined in the regulations) to Risk-Weighted Assets (as defined) and Tier 1 Capital (as defined) to Net Average Assets (as defined). The risk-based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk-weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet assets to broad risk categories. 
In 2019, a final rule adopted by the federal banking agencies provided banking organizations with the option to phase in, over a three-year period, the adverse day-one regulatory capital effects of the adoption of the CECL accounting standard. In 2020, as part of its response to the impact of COVID-19, U.S. federal banking regulatory agencies issued a final rule which provides banking organizations that implement CECL during the 2020 calendar year the option to delay for two years, an estimate of CECL’s effect on regulatory capital relative to the incurred loss methodology’s effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period, which the Association and Company have adopted. During the two-year delay, the Association and Company added back to CET1 100% of the initial adoption impact of CECL plus 25% of the cumulative quarterly changes in the allowance for credit losses. 
Beginning fiscal year 2023, the cumulative transitional amounts became fixed and are being phased out of CET1 capital ratably over three years.

At September 30, 2024, the Association exceeded all regulatory capital requirements and is considered “well capita
lized” under regulatory guidelines.
The Association operates under the capital requirements for the standardized approach of the Basel III capital framework for U.S. banking organizations (“Basel III Rules”), which limits capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a "capital conservation buffer" consisting of 2.5% in addition to the minimum capital requirements. At September 30, 2024, the Association exceeded the fully phased-in regulatory requirement for the "capital conservation buffer."
The following table summarizes the actual capital amounts and ratios of the Association as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, compared to the minimum capital adequacy requirements and the requirements for classification as a well capitalized institution.

The unrealized losses on investment securities were primarily attributable to an increase in market interest rates. The investment portfolio is comprised entirely of securities issued by U.S. government entities and agencies, which support the expectation of zero, other than temporary, loss estimates since principal and interest payments due on these securities carry the full faith and credit guaranty of the U.S. government. In addition, the U.S. Treasury Department established financing agreements in 2008 to ensure Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac meet their obligations to holders of mortgage-backed securities that they have issued or guaranteed.
Since the decline in value is primarily attributable to an increase in market interest rates and not credit quality deterioration, and because the Company has neither the intent to sell the securities nor is it more likely than not the Company will be required to sell the securities prior to recovery of the amortized cost, the Company did not record an allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2024 or September 30, 2023.

Loans held for investment are carried at amortized cost, which includes outstanding principal balance adjusted for any unamortized premiums or discounts, net of deferred fees and expenses and any applicable loans-in-process. Accrued interest is $
56,982
 and $
51,989
 as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, and is reported in accrued interest receivable on the 
CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CONDITION.
A large concentration of the Company’s lending is in Ohio and Florida. At September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the percentage of aggregate Residential Core, Home Today and Construction loans secured by properties in Ohio was 
58
% and 
57
%, respectively, and the percentage of loans secured by properties in Florida was 
17
% and 
18
%, respectively. At September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, home equity loans and lines of credit were concentrated in the states of Ohio (
24
% and 
26
%, respectively), Florida (
23
% and 
22
%, respectively), and California (
17
% as of both dates). 
Residential Core mortgage loans represent the largest portion of the residential real estate portfolio. The Company believes overall credit risk is low based on the nature, composition, collateral, products, lien position and performance of the portfolio. The portfolio does not include loan types or structures that have experienced severe performance problems at other financial institutions (sub-prime, no documentation or pay-option adjustable-rate mortgages). The portfolio contains "Smart Rate" adjustable-rate mortgage loans whereby the interest rate is locked initially for three or five years then resets annually, subject to periodic rate adjustments caps and various re-lock options available to the borrower. Although the borrower is qualified for its loan at a higher rate than the initial rate offered, the adjustable-rate feature may impact a borrower's ability to afford the higher payments upon rate reset during periods of rising interest rates while this repayment risk may be reduced in a declining or low rate environment. With limited historical loss experience compared to other types of loans in the portfolio, judgment is required by management in assessing the allowance required on adjustable-rate mortgage loans. The principal amount of adjustable-rate mortgage loans included in the Residential Core portfolio was $
4,379,132
 and $
4,760,843
 at September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.
Home Today was an affordable housing program targeted to benefit low- and moderate-income home buyers. Most loans under the program were originated prior to 2009. 
No
 new loans were originated under the Home Today program after 2016. Home Today loans have greater credit risk than traditional residential real estate mortgage loans. 
Home equity loans and lines of credit, which are comprised primarily of home equity lines of credit, represent a significant portion of the residential real estate portfolio and include monthly principal and interest payments throughout the entire term. The full credit exposure on home equity lines of credit is secured by the value of the collateral real estate at the time of origination. At September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, the amortized cost of home equity lines of credit was $
3,361,176
 and $
2,733,275
, and the amortized cost of home equity loans and bridge loans was $
565,840
 and $
334,006
.
The Company originates construction loans to individuals for the construction of their personal single-family residence by a qualified builder (construction/permanent loans). The Company’s construction/permanent loans generally provide for disbursements to the builder or sub-contractors during the construction phase as work progresses. During the construction phase, the borrower only pays interest on the drawn balance. Upon completion of construction, the loan converts to a permanent 
86
Table of Contents

amortizing loan without the expense of a second closing. The Company offers construction/permanent loans with fixed or adjustable-rates, and a current maximum loan-to-completed-appraised value ratio of 
85
%. 
Other loans are comprised of loans secured by certificate of deposit accounts, which are fully recoverable in the event of non-payment, and forgivable down payment assistance loans, which are unsecured loans used as down payment assistance to borrowers who qualify for the Company's down payment assistance programs, often managed in cooperation with partner housing agencies. The Company records a liability for the down payment assistance loans which are forgiven in equal increments over a pre-determined term, subject to residency requirements.
Loans held for sale include loans originated or purchased with the intent to sell which are generally priced in alignment with secondary market pricing and may be subject to loan level pricing adjustments. Additionally, loans originated or purchased for the held for investment portfolio may later be identified for sale and transferred to the held for sale portfolio, which may include loans originated or purchased within the parameters of programs established by Fannie Mae. During the years ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, reclassifications to the held for sale portfolio included loans that were sold during the period, including those in contracts pending settlement at the end of the period, and loans originated for the held for investment portfolio that were later identified for sale. At September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, mortgage loans held for sale totaled $
17,775
 and $
3,260
, respectively. During the years ended September 30, 2024, September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the principal balance of loans sold (including loans in contracts pending settlement when applicable) was $
247,442
, $
77,205
, and $
128,118
, respectively. During the years ended September 30, 2024, September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the amortized cost of loans classified as held for sale that were subsequently transferred to the held for investment portfolio was $
8,525
, $
8,433
 and $
22,741
, respectively.

Loans are placed in non-accrual status when they are contractually 90 days or more past due. The number of days past due is determined by the number of scheduled payments that remain unpaid, assuming a period of 30 days between each scheduled 
87
Table of Contents

payment. Loans with a partial charge-off are placed in non-accrual and will remain in non-accrual status until, at a minimum, the loss is recovered. Loans modified that were in non-accrual status prior to modification and loans with forbearance plans that were subsequently modified, are reported in non-accrual status for a minimum of six months after modification. Loans modified with a high debt-to-income ratio, per the Company's modification policy, at the time of modification are placed in non-accrual status for a minimum of 12 months. Additionally, home equity loans and lines of credit where the customer has a severely delinquent first mortgage loan (greater than 90 days past due) and loans in Chapter 7 bankruptcy status where all borrowers have filed, and not reaffirmed or been dismissed, are placed in non-accrual status.

The amortized cost of loan receivables in non-accrual status is summarized in the following table. Non-accrual with no ACL describes non-accrual loans which have no quantitative allowance, primarily because they have already been subject to collateral review and any required charge-offs have been taken, but may be included in consideration of qualitative allowance factors. There are 
no
 loans 90 or more days past due and still accruing at September 30, 2024 or September 30, 2023.

At September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, the amortized cost in non-accrual loans includes $
19,704
 and $
18,915
, which are performing according to the terms of their agreement, of which $
11,532
 and $
11,508
, are loans in Chapter 7 bankruptcy status, primarily where all borrowers have filed, and have not reaffirmed or been dismissed. At September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, real estate loans include $
10,527
 and $
9,144
, respectively, of loans that were in the process of foreclosure.
Interest on loans in accrual status is recognized in interest income as it accrues, on a daily basis. Accrued interest on loans in non-accrual status is written off by a charge to interest income and income is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received. The Company has elected not to measure an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable amounts since amounts are written off timely. Cash payments on loans in non-accrual status are applied to the oldest scheduled, unpaid payment first.
 The amount of interest income recognized on non-accrual loans was $
750
 and $
663
 for the years ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.
 Cash payments on loans with a partial charge-off are applied fully to principal, then to recovery of the charged off amount prior to interest income being recognized, except cash payments may be applied to interest capitalized in a modification when collection of remaining amounts due is considered probable. A non-accrual loan is generally returned to accrual status when contractual payments are less than 90 days past due. However, a loan may remain in non-accrual status when collectability is uncertain, such as a modification that has not met minimum payment requirements, a loan with a partial charge-off, a home equity loan or line of credit with a delinquent first mortgage greater than 90 days past due, or a loan in Chapter 7 bankruptcy status where all borrowers have filed, and have not reaffirmed or been dismissed.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES
The allowance for credit losses represents the estimate of lifetime losses in the loan portfolio and unfunded loan commitments. The allowance is estimated at each reporting date using relevant available information relating to past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company utilizes loan level regression models with forecasted economic data to derive the probability of default and loss given default factors. These factors are used to calculate the loan level credit loss over a 24-month period with an immediate reversion to historical mean loss rates for the remaining life of the loans.
The Company adopted ASU 2022-02 on October 1, 2023, which eliminated the accounting for TDRs. As such, at September 30, 2024, there was 
no
 allowance for individually reviewed TDRs (IVAs), based on the present value of cash flows, as compared to September 30, 2023, when there was $
9,546
. Effective with this adoption, losses on loans with modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties, previously identified as TDRs, will be estimated as described above, in the same manner as loans that have not been subject to such modifications.
Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Qualitative adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in 
88
Table of Contents

underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency status or likely recovery of previous loan charge-offs. Qualitative adjustments for expected changes in environmental conditions, such as changes in unemployment rates, property values or other relevant factors, are recognized when forecasted economic data used in the model differs from management's view or contains significant unobservable changes within a short period. Identifiable model limitations may also lead to qualitative adjustments, such as those made to reflect the expected recovery of loan amounts previously charged-off, beyond what the model is able to project. The qualitative adjustments resulted in a negative ending balance on the allowance for credit losses for the Home Today portfolio, where recoveries are expected to exceed charge-offs over the remaining life of that portfolio. The net qualitative adjustment at September 30, 2024, was a net reduction to the allowance for credit loses of $
5,519
, compared to a reduction of $
13,425
 at September 30, 2023. At September 30, 2024, a portion of the allowance for credit losses that had been measured qualitatively at September 30, 2023, was included in the model-driven quantitative estimate due to enhancements in data quality. Qualitative adjustments are evaluated quarterly, at a minimum, based on current facts and circumstances.
Partial or full charge-offs are recognized for the amount of credit losses on loans when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty as described by meeting the conditions below:
•
For residential mortgage loans, payments are greater than 
180
 days delinquent;
•
For home equity loans and lines of credit, and modified residential loans, payments are greater than 
90
 days delinquent;
•
For all classes of loan modifications with a high debt-to-income ratio at time of modification;
•
For all classes of loans, a sheriff sale is scheduled within 
60
 days to sell the collateral securing the loan;
•
For all classes of loans, all borrowers have been discharged of their obligation through a Chapter 7 bankruptcy;
•
For all classes of loans, within 
60
 days of notification, all borrowers obligated on the loan have filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not reaffirmed or been dismissed;
•
For all classes of loans, a borrower obligated on a loan has filed bankruptcy and the loan is greater than 
30
 days delinquent; and
•
For all classes of loans, it becomes evident that a loss is probable.
Charge-offs on residential mortgage loans, home equity loans and lines of credit, and construction loans are also recognized when triggering events, such as foreclosure actions, short sales, or deeds accepted in lieu of repayment, result in less than full repayment of the amortized cost in the loans.
For all classes of loans, a loan is considered collateral-dependent when, based on current information and events, the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the sale of the collateral or foreclosure is probable. Factors considered in determining that a loan is collateral-dependent may include the deteriorating financial condition of the borrower indicated by missed or delinquent payments, or a pending legal action, such as bankruptcy or foreclosure.

Collateral-dependent residential mortgage loans and construction loans are charged-off to the extent the amortized cost in the loan, net of anticipated mortgage insurance claims, exceeds the fair value, less estimated costs to dispose of the underlying property. Management can determine if the loan is uncollectible for reasons such as foreclosures exceeding a reasonable time frame and recommend a full charge-off. Home equity loans or lines of credit are charged-off to the extent the amortized cost in the loan plus the balance of any senior liens exceeds the fair value, less estimated costs to dispose of the underlying property, or management determines the collateral is not sufficient to satisfy the loan. A loan in any portfolio identified as collateral-dependent will continue to be reported as such until it is no longer considered collateral-dependent, is less than 
30
 days past due and does not have a prior charge-off. A loan in any portfolio that has a partial charge-off will continue to be individually evaluated for credit loss until, at a minimum, the loss has been recovered.

The home equity lines of credit converted from revolving to term loans during the years ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, totaled $
10,475
 and $
2,492
, respectively. The amount of conversions to term loans is expected to remain relatively low for several years since the length of the draw period on new originations changed from 
five
 to 
10
 years in 2016.
Residential loans are internally assigned a grade that complies with the guidelines outlined in the OCC’s Handbook for Rating Credit Risk. Pass loans are assets well protected by the current paying capacity of the borrower. Special Mention loans have a potential weakness, as evaluated based on delinquency status or nature of the product, that the Company deems to deserve management’s attention and may result in further deterioration in their repayment prospects and/or the Company’s credit position. Substandard loans are inadequately protected by the current payment capacity of the borrower or the collateral pledged with a defined weakness that jeopardizes the liquidation of the debt. Also included in Substandard are performing home equity loans and lines of credit where the customer has a severely delinquent first mortgage to which the performing home equity loan or line of credit is subordinate and all loans in Chapter 7 bankruptcy status where all borrowers have filed, and have not reaffirmed or been dismissed. Loss loans are considered uncollectible and are charged-off when identified. Loss 
92
Table of Contents

loans are of such little value that their continuance as bankable assets is not warranted even though partial recovery may be effected in the future.
Other loans are internally assigned a grade of non-performing when they become 90 days or more past due. At September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, 
no
 other loans were graded as non-performing.
MODIFICATIONS TO BORROWERS EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY
On October 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2022-02, which eliminates the accounting guidance for TDRs and enhances the disclosure requirements for certain loan modifications when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. For additional information on the adoption, refer to Note 
20. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
.
To mitigate losses, the Company works with borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty to identify solutions the borrowers can afford by entering into agreements to modify their loans. These efforts often result in modifications to the payment terms of the loan, which vary by situation and may include interest rate reductions, term extensions (generally including capitalization of delinquent amounts), significant payment delays (including forbearance, partial payments and repayment of delinquent amounts), other, or a combination thereof. The Company does not generally offer principal forgiveness as a type of modification. The Other category includes loans that were modified multiple times during the period with different concessions.
If a borrower is experiencing an income curtailment that temporarily has reduced their capacity to repay, such as loss of employment, reduction of work hours, non-paid leave or short-term disability, a temporary modification is considered. If a borrower lacks the capacity to repay the loan at the current terms due to a permanent condition, a permanent modification is considered. Loans may be modified more than once. Among other requirements, a subsequent modification may be available for a borrower upon the expiration of temporary modified terms if the borrower is unable to resume contractually scheduled loan payments. In evaluating the need for a subsequent modification, the borrower’s ability to repay is generally assessed utilizing a debt-to-income and cash flow analysis.
The following tables present the amortized cost of modifications by type during the period presented. For the year ended September 30, 2024, there were 
no
 modifications made on construction loans.

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2022-02
Prior to the adoption of ASU 2022-02 on October 1, 2023, initial concessions granted for loans restructured as TDRs include reduction of interest rate, extension of amortization period, capitalization of delinquent amounts, forbearance or other actions. Some TDRs had experienced a combination of concessions. TDRs also could occur as a result of bankruptcy proceedings. Loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy were classified as multiple restructurings if the loan's original terms had also been restructured by the Company. At September 30, 2023, $
73,172
 of TDRs individually evaluated for credit loss had adequately performed under the terms of the restructuring and were classified as Pass loans.
The amortized cost in TDRs by category, at September 30, 2023, is shown in the table below.

MORTGAGE LOAN SERVICING RIGHTS
The Company sells certain types of loans through whole loan sales and through securitizations. In each case, the Company retains a servicing interest in the loans or securitized loans. Certain assumptions and estimates are used to determine the fair value allocated to these retained interests at the date of transfer and at subsequent measurement dates. These assumptions and estimates include loan repayment rates and discount rates.
Changes in interest rates can affect the average life of loans and mortgage-backed securities and the related servicing rights. A reduction in interest rates normally results in increased prepayments, as borrowers refinance their debt in order to reduce their borrowing costs. This creates reinvestment risk, which is the risk that the Company may not be able to reinvest the proceeds of loan and securities prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates earned on the loans or securities prior to receipt of the repayment.
During 2024, 2023 and 2022, $
237,106
, $
77,206
 and $
128,118
, respectively, of mortgage loans were securitized and/or sold including accrued interest thereon. In these transactions, the Company retained residual interests in the form of mortgage loan servicing rights. 
Primary economic assumptions used to measure the value of the Company’s retained interests at the date of sale resulting from the completed transactions were as follows (per annum):

Table of Contents

Key economic assumptions and the sensitivity of the current fair value of mortgage loan servicing rights to immediate 10% and 20% adverse changes in those assumptions are as presented in the following table. The three key economic assumptions that impact the valuation of the mortgage loan servicing rights are: (1) the prepayment speed, or how long the mortgage servicing right will be outstanding; (2) the estimate of servicing costs that will be incurred in fulfilling the mortgage servicing right responsibilities; and (3) the discount factor applied to future net cash flows to convert them to present value. The Company established these factors based on independent analysis of our portfolio and reviews these assumptions periodically to ensure that they reasonably reflect current market conditions and our loan portfolio experience.

These sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution. As indicated in the table above, changes in fair value based on a 10% variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship in the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the retained interest is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another (for example, increases in market interest rates may result in lower prepayments), which could magnify or counteract the sensitivities.
Servicing rights are evaluated periodically for impairment based on the fair value of those rights. 
Twenty
 risk tranches are used in evaluating servicing rights for impairment, segregated primarily by interest rate stratum within original term to maturity categories with additional strata for less uniform account types.
Activity in mortgage servicing rights is summarized as follows. There was no change in the valuation allowance for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

LEASES
As a lessee, the Company enters into operating leases of buildings and land. The Company occupies certain banking branches, loan production and customer care call center offices and a disaster recovery site through non-cancellable operating leases with remaining terms from less than 
one
 year to 
13
 years. Most of the leases have fixed payment terms with annual fixed-escalation clauses. Certain leases have annual rent escalations based on subsequent year-to-year changes in the consumer price index. These year-to-year changes in the consumer price index are excluded from the calculation of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities and recognized as expense in the period in which they are incurred. Additionally, all variable lease costs that are not based on an index or rate, such as "common area maintenance" costs, are expensed as incurred. Most of the Company's leases include options to extend for periods that range from 
three
 to 
five
 years. The leases do not have early-termination options. The Company has not included term extensions in the calculation of the lease term, as the Company does not consider it reasonably certain that the options will be exercised. As the interest rate implicit in all of the Company's lease contracts is not readily determinable, the Company utilized its incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate that would be incurred to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term on an amount equal to the total contractual lease payments in a similar economic environment. The incremental borrowing rate utilized for all the Company's leases is an FHLB Advance rate based on the lease term at commencement in determining the present value of lease payments.
Operating lease expense for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, totaled $
5,781
, $
5,573
 and $
5,576
, respectively. Variable lease expense for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, totaled $
1,731
, $
1,514
 and $
1,479
, respectively. During the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company paid $
5,708
, $
5,556
 and $
5,572
, respectively, in cash for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company has not entered into any material leases that have not yet commenced.

In the accompanying 
CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CONDITION
 the net deferred tax asset or liability is included in other assets, and accrued expenses and other liabilities for September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. There was 
no
 valuation allowance required at September 30, 2024 or 2023.
Retained earnings at September 30, 2024 and 2023 included approximately $
104,861
, for which 
no
 provision for federal or state income tax has been made. This amount represents allocations of income during years prior to 1988 to bad debt deductions for tax purposes only. These qualifying and non-qualifying base year reserves and supplemental reserves will be recaptured into income in the event of certain distributions and redemptions. Such recapture would create income for tax purposes only, which would be subject to the then current corporate income tax rate. However, recapture would not occur upon the reorganization, merger, or acquisition of the Association, nor if the Association is merged or liquidated tax-free into a bank or undergoes a charter change. If the Association fails to qualify as a bank or merges into a non-bank entity, these reserves will be recaptured into income.
The provisions of Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, codified within FASB ASC 740 “Income Taxes,” prescribe a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FASB ASC 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. Tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold in order for the related tax benefit to be recognized or continue to be recognized. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had 
no
 unrecognized tax benefits. The Company does not anticipate the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly change within the next twelve months. 
The Company recognizes interest and penalties on income tax assessments or income tax refunds, where applicable, in the financial statements as a component of its provision for income taxes. The Company recognized $
7
, $
0
, and $
0
 of interest expense or penalties on income tax assessments, and $
0
, $
0
, and $
34
 of interest on income tax refunds related to net operating loss carry-backs during the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. There was 
no
 interest related to income tax assessments accrued at September 30, 2024 or 2023.
The Company’s effective income tax rate was 
20.7
%, 
19.4
% and 
19.0
% for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and city jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations in its major jurisdictions for tax years prior to 2021. 
The Company makes certain investments in limited partnerships which invest in affordable housing projects that qualify for the LIHTC. The Company acts as a limited partner in these investments and does not exert control over the operating or financial policies of the partnership. The Company accounts for its interests in LIHTCs using the proportional amortization method. The impact of the Company's investments in tax credit entities on the provision for income taxes was not material for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
Defined Benefit Plan
—
The Third Federal Savings Retirement Plan (the “Plan”) is a defined benefit pension plan. Effective December 31, 2002, the Plan was amended to limit participation to employees who met the Plan’s eligibility requirements on that date. Effective December 31, 2011, the Plan was amended to freeze future benefit accruals for participants in the Plan. After December 31, 2002, employees not participating in the Plan, upon meeting the applicable eligibility requirements, and those eligible participants who no longer receive service credits under the Plan, participate in a separate tier of the Company’s defined contribution 401(k) Savings Plan. Benefits under the Plan are based on years of service and the employee’s average annual compensation (as defined in the Plan) through December 31, 2011. The funding policy of the Plan is consistent with the funding requirements of U.S. federal and other governmental laws and regulations. There were 
no
 settlement adjustments made during the fiscal years 2024 or 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Plan utilizes a liability-driven investing (LDI) strategy. The LDI strategy de-risks the Plan by allocating more to long-duration, fixed income assets. The Plan's target asset allocation is currently 
80
% in LDI fixed income and 
20
% in equity.
The following table sets forth the change in projected benefit obligation for the defined benefit plan:

The expected long-term return on plan assets assumption was developed as a weighted average rate based on the target asset allocation of the Plan and the Long-Term Capital Market Assumptions for the corresponding fiscal year end. Management evaluates the historical performance of the various asset categories, as well as current expectations in determining the adequacy of the assumed rates of return in meeting Plan obligations. If warranted, the assumption is modified.

401(k) Savings Plan
—
The Company maintains a 401(k) savings plan that is comprised of three tiers. The first tier allows eligible employees to contribute up to 
75
% of their compensation to the plan, subject to limitations established by the Internal Revenue Service, with the Company matching 
100
% of up to 
4
% on funds contributed. The second tier permits the Company to make a profit-sharing contribution at its discretion. The first and second tiers cover substantially all employees who have reached age 
18
 and have worked 30 days of service within one year. The third tier permits the Company to make discretionary contributions allocable to eligible employees including those eligible employees who are participants, but no longer receiving service credits, under the Company’s defined benefit pension plan. Voluntary contributions made by employees are vested at all times whereas Company contributions and Company matching contributions are subject to various vesting periods which range from 
immediately
 vested to fully vesting upon 
five years
 of service.
The total of the Company’s matching and discretionary contributions related to the 401(k) savings plan for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $
3,404
, $
4,297
 and $
4,295
, respectively.
Employee (Associate) Stock Ownership Plan
—
The Company established an ESOP for its employees (associates) effective January 1, 2006. The ESOP is a tax-qualified plan designed to invest primarily in the Company’s common stock and provides employees with an opportunity to receive a funded retirement benefit, based on the value of the Company’s common stock. The ESOP covers all eligible employees of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Employees are eligible to participate in the ESOP after attainment of age 
18
, completion of 
1,000
 hours of service, and employment on the last day of the plan’s calendar year. Company contributions to the plan are at the discretion of the Board of Directors. The ESOP is accounted for in accordance with the provisions for stock compensation in FASB ASC 718
.
 Compensation expense for the ESOP is based on the market price of the Company’s stock and is recognized as shares are committed to be released to participants. The total compensation expense related to this plan in the 2024, 2023 and 2022 fiscal years was $
5,628
, $
5,761
 and $
7,063
, respectively.
The ESOP was authorized to purchase, and did purchase, 
11,605,824
 shares of the Company’s common stock at a price of $
10
 per share with a 2006 plan year cash contribution and the proceeds of a loan from the Company to the ESOP. The outstanding loan principal balance as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $
33,015
 and $
37,254
, respectively. Shares of the Company’s common stock pledged as collateral for the loan are released from the pledge for allocation to participants as loan payments are made. At September 30, 2024, 
9,005,788
 shares have been allocated to participants and 
325,005
 shares were committed to be released. Shares that are committed to be released will be allocated to participants at the end of the plan year (December 31). ESOP shares that are unallocated or not yet committed to be released totaled 
2,275,031
 at September 30, 2024, and had a fair market value of $
34,830
. Participants have the option to receive dividends on allocated shares in cash or leave the dividend in the ESOP. Dividends are reinvested in Company stock for those participants who choose to leave their dividends in the ESOP or who do not make an election. The purchase of Company stock for reinvestment of dividends is made in the open market on or about the date of the cash disbursement to the participants who opt to take dividends in cash. Dividends on unallocated shares held in the Employer Stock fund were paid to the trustee to be used to make payments on the outstanding loan obligation.

 over a weighted average period of 
2.07
 years.
Performance share units vest in the form of Company common stock issued at the end of a 
three
-year period, based on the pro-rata achievement of performance based metrics over a 
two
-year period. The range of payout is 
0
% to 
150
% of the number of share units granted. For performance stock units, fair value is estimated as the product of the number of performance units granted, adjusted for the probability of achievement, and the grant date market price of the Company’s common stock. The Company recognizes compensation expense for the fair value of performance share units on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, based on the performance condition that is probable of achievement. Probability of achievement is reassessed at each reporting period and the cumulative effect of a change in estimate, if any, is recognized in the period of change. Cash dividend equivalents are accrued and paid only if and when the underlying units become vested and payable.

The expected dividend yield for 2024 was estimated on the then-current annualized dividend payout of $
1.13
 per share, which was not expected to change. Volatility of the company's stock was used in the estimation of fair value. Management estimated the expected life of the options using the simplified method allowed under SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 110, which expresses the views of the SEC regarding the use of a "simplified" method, as discussed in Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107. The five and seven year Treasury yield in effect at the time of the grant provides the risk free rate of return for periods within the expected term of the options.
The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted during the year ended September 30, 2024 was $
1.22
. Expected future compensation relating to the non-vested options outstanding as of September 30, 2024 is $
220
 over a weighted average period of 
2.10
 years. Upon exercise of vested options, management expects to draw on treasury stock as the source of the shares. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $
0
, $

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into commitments with off-balance-sheet risk to meet the financing needs of its customers. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments to originate or purchase loans generally have fixed expiration dates of 
60
 to 
360
 days or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Unfunded commitments related to home equity lines of credit generally expire 
10
 years following the date that the line of credit was established, subject to various conditions including compliance with payment obligation, adequacy of collateral securing the line and maintenance of a satisfactory credit profile by the borrower. Since some of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
Off-balance sheet commitments to extend credit involve elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the 
CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CONDITION
. The Company’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the commitment is represented by the contractual amount of the commitment. The Company generally uses the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments. The allowance for credit losses related to off-balance sheet commitments is recorded in other liabilities in the 
CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CONDITION
. Refer to Note
 5. LOANS AND ALLOWANCES FOR CREDIT LOSSES
 for discussion on credit loss methodology. Interest rate risk on commitments to extend credit results from the possibility that interest rates may have moved unfavorably from the position of the Company since the time the commitment was made. 
At September 30, 2024, the Company had commitments to originate or purchase loans and related allowances as follows:

17,411
 and $

, respectively, in commitments to sell mortgage loans. At September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company had $
15,891
 and $
51,275
, respectively, in commitments to purchase mortgage loans, which are included in mortgage loan commitments above.
The above commitments are expected to be funded through normal operations.
The Association is undergoing an escheat audit covering Ohio, Kentucky and Florida. Any potential loss that may result from this matter is not reasonably estimable at September 30, 2024.
The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to various legal actions arising in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, the resolution of these legal actions is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operation, or statements of cash flows.

FAIR VALUE
Under U.S. GAAP, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. A fair value framework is established whereby assets and liabilities measured at fair value are grouped into three levels of a fair value hierarchy, based on the transparency of inputs and the reliability of assumptions used to estimate fair value.

Presented below is a discussion of the methods and significant assumptions used by the Company to estimate fair value.
Investment Securities Available for Sale
—
Investment securities available for sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, this includes $
526,251
 and $
508,324
, respectively, of investments in U.S. government and agency obligations including U.S. Treasury notes and investments in highly liquid collateralized mortgage obligations, that can include items issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae, measured using the market approach. The fair values of investment securities represent unadjusted price estimates obtained from independent third-party nationally recognized pricing services using pricing models or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics and are included in Level 2 of the hierarchy. Third party pricing is reviewed on a monthly basis for reasonableness based on the market knowledge and experience of company personnel that interact daily with the markets for these types of securities.
Mortgage Loans Held for Sale
—
The fair value of mortgage loans held for sale is estimated on an aggregate basis using a market approach based on quoted secondary market pricing for loan portfolios with similar characteristics. Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, with the exception of mortgage loans held for sale subject to pending agency contracts to securitize and sell loans. The Company elects the fair value measurement option for mortgage loans held for sale subject to pending agency contracts to securitize and sell loans, as permitted under the fair value guidance in U.S. GAAP. This election is expected to reduce volatility in earnings related to market fluctuations between the contract trade and settlement dates. At September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, there were $
10,713
 and $
0
 pending agency contracts held for sale measured at fair value, respectively, with unpaid principal balances of $
10,336
 and $
0
. For the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net gain (loss) on the sale of loans includes $
337
 and $
0
, respectively, related to unrealized gains or losses during the period due to changes in the fair value of loans held for sale subject to pending agency contracts. At September 30, 2024 and 2023 there were $
7,061
 and $
0
 of loans held for sale carried at cost. Loans held for sale are included in Level 2 of the hierarchy. Interest income on mortgage loans held for sale is recorded in interest income on loans. 
Collateral-Dependent Loans
—
Collateral-dependent loans represent certain loans held for investment that are subject to a fair value measurement under U.S. GAAP because they are individually evaluated using a fair value measurement, such as the fair value of the underlying collateral. Credit loss is measured using a market approach based on the fair value of the collateral, less estimated costs to dispose, for loans the Company considers to be collateral-dependent due to a delinquency status or other adverse condition severe enough to indicate that the borrower can no longer be relied upon as the continued source of repayment. These conditions are described more fully in 
Note 5. LOANS AND ALLOWANCES FOR CREDIT LOSSES
. To calculate the credit loss of collateral-dependent loans, the fair market values of the collateral, estimated using third-party appraisals in the majority of instances, are reduced by calculated estimated costs to dispose, derived from historical experience and recent market conditions. Any indicated credit loss is recognized by a charge to the allowance for credit losses. Subsequent increases in collateral values or principal pay downs on loans with recognized credit loss could result in a collateral-dependent loan being carried below its fair value. When no credit loss is indicated, the carrying amount is considered to approximate the fair value of that loan to the Company because contractually that is the maximum repayment the Company can expect. The amortized cost of loans individually evaluated for credit loss based on the fair value of the collateral are included in Level 3 of the hierarchy with assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. The range and weighted average impact of estimated costs to dispose on fair values is determined at the time of credit loss or when additional credit loss is recognized and is included in quantitative information about significant unobservable inputs later in this note.
Real Estate Owned
—
Real estate owned includes real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure and is carried at the lower of the cost basis or fair value, less estimated costs to dispose. The carrying amounts of real estate owned at September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were $
174
 and $
1,444
, respectively. Fair value is estimated under the market approach using independent third party appraisals. As these properties are actively marketed, estimated fair values may be adjusted by management to reflect current economic and market conditions. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, these adjustments were not significant to reported fair values. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, $
220
 and $
1,413
, respectively, of real estate owned is included in Level 3 of the hierarchy with assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis where the cost basis equals or exceeds the estimated fair values, less estimated costs to dispose, of $
46
 and $
163
, respectively. Real estate owned includes $
0
 and $
194
 of properties carried at their original or adjusted cost basis at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Derivatives
—
Derivative instruments include interest rate lock commitments on loans being originated or purchased for the held for sale portfolio, forward commitments on contracts to deliver mortgage loans, and interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges. Derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges are reported at fair value in Other assets or Other liabilities on the 
CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CONDITION
 with changes in value recorded in current earnings. Derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges are settled daily, bringing their fair value to $
0
. Refer to Note 
17. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
 for additional information on cash flow hedges and other derivative instruments. Interest rate lock commitments are commitments to lend at interest rates and amounts defined prior to funding. The fair value of interest rate lock commitments is adjusted by a closure rate based on the estimated percentage of commitments that will result in closed loans. The range and weighted average impact of the closure rate is included in quantitative information about significant unobservable inputs later in this note. A significant change in the closure rate may result in a significant change in the ending fair value measurement of these derivatives relative to their total fair value. Because the closure rate is a significantly unobservable assumption, interest rate lock commitments are included in Level 3 of the hierarchy. Forward commitments on contracts to deliver mortgage loans are included in Level 2 of the hierarchy.
Assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis in the 
CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CONDITION

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
The Company enters into interest rate swaps to add stability to interest expense and manage exposure to interest rate movements as part of an overall risk management strategy. For hedges of the Company's borrowing and deposit program, interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed payments. These derivatives are used to hedge the forecasted cash outflows associated with the Company's FHLB borrowings and brokered certificates of deposit. Cash flows from derivatives used to manage interest rate risks are classified as operating activities in the cash flow statement. The Company classifies both the earnings and cash flow impact from these derivatives consistent with the underlying hedged item.
Cash flow hedges are initially assessed for effectiveness using regression analysis. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in OCI and is subsequently reclassified into earnings during the period in which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. Derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges are settled daily, bringing their fair value to $
0
. Quarterly, a quantitative analysis is preformed to monitor the ongoing effectiveness of the hedging instrument. All derivative positions were initially, and continue to be, highly effective at September 30, 2024.
The Company enters into forward commitments for the sale of mortgage loans primarily to protect against the risk of lost revenue from adverse interest rate movements on net income. The Company recognizes the fair value of such contracts when the characteristics of those contracts meet the definition of a derivative. These derivatives are not designated in a hedging relationship; therefore, gains and losses are recognized immediately in the 
CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME
. 
In addition, the Company is party to derivative instruments when it enters into interest rate lock commitments to originate a portion of its loans, which when funded, are classified as held for sale. Such commitments are not designated in a hedging relationship; therefore, gains and losses are recognized immediately in the 
CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME
.

The Company estimates that $
25,797
 of the amounts reported in AOCI will be reclassified as a reduction to interest expense during the fiscal year ending September 30, 2025.
Derivatives contain an element of credit risk which arises from the possibility that the Company will incur a loss because a counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations. The Company's exposure is limited to the replacement value of the contracts rather than the notional or principal amounts. Credit risk is minimized through counterparty margin payments, transaction limits and monitoring procedures. All of the Company's swap transactions are cleared through a registered clearing broker to a central clearing organization. The clearing organization establishes daily cash and upfront cash or securities margin requirements to cover potential exposure in the event of default. This process shifts the risk away from the counterparty, since the clearing organization acts as an intermediary on each cleared transaction. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, there was $
7,844
 and $
24,887
, respectively, of cash collateral included in other assets, and $
68,932
 and $
59,813
, respectively, included in investment securities related to initial margin requirements that are held by the central clearing organization. For derivative transactions cleared through certain clearing parties, variation margin payments are recognized as settlements on a daily basis.

EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share is the amount of earnings available to each share of common stock outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per share is the amount of earnings available to each share of common stock outstanding during the reporting period, adjusted to include the effect of potentially dilutive common shares. For purposes of computing earnings per share amounts, outstanding shares include shares held by the public, shares held by the ESOP that have been allocated to participants or committed to be released for allocation to participants and the 
227,119,132
 shares held by Third Federal Savings, MHC. For purposes of computing dilutive earnings per share, stock options and restricted and performance share units with a dilutive impact are added to the outstanding shares used in the basic earnings per share calculation. Unvested shares awarded pursuant to the Company's restricted stock plans are treated as participating securities in the computation of EPS pursuant to the two-class method as they contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends. The two-class method is an earnings allocation that determines EPS for each class of common stock and participating security. Performance share units, determined to be contingently issuable and not participating securities, are excluded from the calculation of basic EPS. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, the ESOP held 
2,275,031
 and 
2,708,371
 shares, respectively, that were neither allocated to participants nor committed to be released to participants.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Adopted in fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 
In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, 
Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326
). The amendments in this update eliminate the accounting guidance for TDR by creditors in Subtopic 310-40, while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and modifications by creditors when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. Additionally, this amendment requires that an entity disclose current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases within the scope of Subtopic 326. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this guidance as of October 1, 2023, and applied the modified retrospective transition method that evaluates loans previously identified as TDRs for credit loss under the Company’s current ACL policy. Upon adoption, an increase in retained earnings of $7,898, net of income taxes, resulted from a pretax decrease to the allowance for credit losses on loans and unfunded commitments of $10,262. The enhanced disclosure requirements provided for by the ASU have been adopted on a prospective basis. The required disclosures are included in Note
 5. LOANS AND ALLOWANCES FOR CREDIT LOSSES
. 
Issued but not yet adopted as of September 30, 2024
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280)
. The amendments in this update improve disclosures about a public entity's reportable segments and addresses request from investors and other allocators of capital for additional information about a reportable segment's expenses. While the Company only has one reportable segment, the update requires public entities with a single segment to provide all segment disclosures under ASC 280. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2024. Retrospective application is required for all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company intends to present the newly required annual disclosures in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2025 and the newly required interim disclosures beginning with its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ending December 31, 2025. The Company does not expect the adoption to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements or disclosures.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09,
 Income Taxes (Topic 740)
. The ASU requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income tax paid. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the ASU on the Company's income tax disclosures within the consolidated financial statements.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40). The amendments in this update improve the disclosures about a public business entity's expenses and address requests from investors for more detailed information about the types of expenses in commonly presented expense captions. The new guidance is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments in this ASU may be applied either (1) prospectively to financial statements issued for reporting periods after the effective date of this ASU or (2) retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Management is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
The Company has determined that all other recently issued accounting pronouncements will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements or do not apply to its operations.
