1. Business-SUPERVISION AND REGULATION-Holding Company Regulation-Waivers of Dividends by Third Federal Savings, MHC
. Regulatory non-objection is subject to periodic regulatory review and no assurances can be given regarding future regulatory non-objection. In addition, a majority of the mutual holding company's members eligible to vote must approve a dividend waiver by a mutual holding company within 12 months prior to the declaration of the dividend being waived. 
At the July 9, 2024 special meeting of members of Third Federal Savings and Loan Association of Cleveland, MHC (the "MHC"), the mutual holding company of TFS Financial Corporation (the "Company"), the members of the MHC (depositors and certain loan customers of Third Federal Savings and Loan Association of Cleveland) voted to approve the MHC's proposed waiver of dividends, aggregating up to $1.13 per share to be declared on the Company's common stock during the twelve months subsequent to the members' approval (i.e., through July 9, 2025). The members approved the waiver by casting 58% of the total eligible votes. Of the votes cast, 97% were in favor of the proposal. The MHC is the 81% majority shareholder of the Company. 
Following the receipt of the members’ approval at the July 9, 2024, special meeting, Third Federal Savings, MHC filed a notice with, and subsequently received the non-objection from the FRB-Cleveland for the proposed dividend waiver.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Overview
Our business strategy is to operate as a well capitalized and profitable financial institution dedicated to providing exceptional personal service to our customers. 
Since being organized in 1938, we grew to become, at the time of our initial public offering of stock in 2007, the nation’s largest mutually-owned savings and loan association based on total assets. We credit our success to our continued emphasis on our primary values: “Love, Trust, Respect, and a Commitment to Excellence, along with Having Fun". Our values are reflected in the design and pricing of our loan and deposit products, as described below. Our values are further reflected in a long-term revitalization program encompassing the three-mile corridor of the Broadway-Slavic Village neighborhood in Cleveland, Ohio where our main office was established and continues to be located and where we've been the developer of a community of 40 homes, intended to serve the low- to moderate income home owner. We intend to continue to adhere to our primary values and to support our customers and the communities in which we operate as we pursue our mission to help people achieve the dream of home ownership and financial security while creating value for our customers, our communities, our associates and our shareholders.
The unprecedented implications of the prolonged period of inversion in the yield curve, influenced by the FRS's restrictive monetary policy resulted in a heightened exposure of certain banking industry practices. The yield curve is currently positive, normalizing in mid-September just prior to the FRS's 50 basis point rate cut, the first in four years. Taking all of this into consideration, we remain committed to our mission, business model and strategic approach. Specifically, (1) our capital ratios remain a primary source of financial strength; (2) our deposits provide a stable source of funding and the majority of our deposit accounts fall within FDIC insurance limits; (3) we maintain adequate access to contingent sources of liquidity; and (4) our risk management practices around an array of financial disciplines which are robust and commensurate to an institution of our size and complexity.
The following tables present select financial data of the Company for the five most recent fiscal years.

(1)
Represents the difference between the weighted-average yield on interest-earning assets and the weighted-average cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the year.
(2)
The net interest margin represents net interest income as a percent of average interest-earning assets for the year.
(3)
The efficiency ratio represents non-interest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and non-interest income.
Management believes that the following matters are those most critical to our success: (1) controlling our interest rate risk exposure; (2) monitoring and limiting our credit risk; (3) maintaining access to adequate liquidity and diverse funding sources to support our growth; and (4) monitoring and controlling our operating expenses. 
Controlling Our Interest Rate Risk Exposure.
 Historically, our greatest risk has been our exposure to changes in market interest rates. When we hold longer-term, fixed-rate assets, funded by liabilities with shorter-term re-pricing characteristics, we are exposed to potentially adverse impacts from changing interest rates, and most notably rising interest rates. Generally, and particularly over extended periods of time that encompass full economic cycles, interest rates associated with longer-term assets, like fixed-rate mortgages, have been higher than interest rates associated with shorter-term funding sources, like deposits. This difference has been an important component of our net interest income and is fundamental to our operations. 
49
Table of Contents

A challenge to our business model occurs when there is a rapid and substantial increase in short-term rates or there is an extended inverted yield curve where short-term rates exceed long-term rates, both of which occurred in the past two years. Although the yield curve became positive in early September 2024, rapid and substantial decreases in short-term rates can also pose a challenge when interest rates on our home equity line of credit portfolio, indexed to the prime rate, reprice more quickly than interest rates on borrowings and certificate of deposit accounts which generally reprice at maturity. These economic environments may result in decreases in our net interest income and our net interest margin.
To mitigate our interest rate risk in general and to address the current rate environment specifically, we utilize a variety of strategies that include:
•
Maintaining regulatory capital in excess of levels required to be considered well capitalized; 
•
Maintaining adjustable-rate mortgage loan balances and shorter-term fixed-rate loans; 
•
Marketing home equity lines of credit, which carry an adjustable rate of interest, indexed to the prime rate; 
•
Opportunistically extending the duration of our funding sources;
•
Utilizing interest rate swaps to convert short-term FHLB advances and brokered certificates of deposit into long-term, fixed-rate borrowings; and
•
Selectively selling a portion of our long-term, fixed-rate mortgage loans in the secondary market.
Levels of Regulatory Capital
At September 30, 2024, the Company’s Tier 1 (leverage) capital totaled $1.86 billion, or 10.89%, of net average assets and 18.50% of risk-weighted assets, while the Association’s Tier 1 (leverage) capital totaled $1.72 billion, or 10.11%, of net average assets and 17.17% of risk-weighted assets. Each of these measures is in excess of the requirements in effect for the Association at September 30, 2024 for designation as “well capitalized” under regulatory prompt corrective action provisions. Beginning this fiscal year, the Company entered into the final two years of the five-year transitional period, as provided by a final rule, after CECL was adopted in fiscal year 2021. Refer to the 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 section of this Item 7 for additional discussion regarding regulatory capital requirements.
Adjustable-Rate Loans and Shorter-Term, Fixed-Rate Loans
We offer our "Smart Rate" adjustable-rate mortgage loan, which provides us with improved interest rate risk characteristics when compared to a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage loan. 
We also offer a 10-year, fully amortizing fixed-rate, first mortgage loan. The 10-year, fixed-rate loan has a more desirable interest rate risk profile when compared to loans with fixed-rate terms of 15 to 30 years and can help to more effectively manage interest rate risk exposure, yet provides our borrowers with the certainty of a fixed interest rate throughout the life of the obligation.

Marketing of Home Equity Lines of Credit
We actively market home equity lines of credit, which carry an adjustable rate of interest indexed to the prime rate which provides interest rate sensitivity to that portion of our assets and is a meaningful strategy to manage our interest rate risk profile. Increasing our investments in loans with variable rates of interest help to better match the maturities and interest rates of our assets and liabilities, thereby reducing the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates. We strive to grow the home equity line of credit portfolio through offering competitive rates, marketing efforts, and by utilizing partners to attract more home equity line of credit customers. At September 30, 2024, the principal balance of home equity lines of credit (including those in repayment) that are structured to reset with each prime rate adjustment totaled $3.32 billion. Our home equity lending is discussed in the preceding
