Recent Developments

On January 2, 2024, we completed the acquisition of Motion Solutions Parent Corp. (“Motion Solutions”), an Irvine, California based provider of highly engineered integrated solutions, specializing in proprietary precision motion and advanced motion control solutions, for a total purchase price of $192.0 million in cash, net of working capital adjustments. The acquisition was financed with borrowings under our revolving credit facility. The addition of Motion Solutions enhances our product portfolio and further expands our presence in attractive medical and precision medicine applications. The Motion Solutions acquisition is included in our Medical Solutions reportable segment.

Business Environment

In recent years, the global economy has faced significant challenges, including inflation, supply chain disruptions, business slowdowns, labor shortages, and market volatility. We address macroeconomic challenges by continuing to execute our strategy. There have been improvements in the supply chain with better on-time deliveries, and recent efforts have successfully addressed talent shortages. However, uncertainty remains about overall macroeconomic conditions due to geopolitical tensions and possible changes in trade policies.

Economic tensions and changes in trade policies, such as higher tariffs, retaliatory measures, renegotiated free trade agreements, changes in government funding, and the ongoing impact from prolonged inflationary pressures could impact the global market for our products. In addition, we continue to monitor geopolitical conflict in Israel, Russia and Ukraine for any potential impact on our businesses.

End Markets

We primarily operate in two end markets: the medical market and the advanced industrial market.

Medical Market

For the year ended December 31, 2024, the medical market accounted for approximately 55% of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the medical market is generally affected by hospital, life science, and other healthcare provider capital spending, growth rates of surgical procedures, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, demand levels for life science automation technology, aggregation of purchasing by healthcare networks, changes in technology requirements, timing of OEM customers’ product development and new product launches, changes in customer or patient preferences, and general demographic trends.

5

Advanced Industrial Market

For the year ended December 31, 2024, the advanced industrial market accounted for approximately 45% of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the advanced industrial market is affected by a number of factors, including changing technology requirements and preferences of our customers, productivity or quality investments in a manufacturing environment, the financial condition of our customers, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, and general economic conditions. We believe that the Purchasing Managers’ Index on manufacturing activities specific to different regions around the world may provide an indication of the impact of general economic conditions on our sales into the advanced industrial market.

Customers

We have a diverse group of customers that includes companies that are global leaders in the medical and advanced industrial markets. Many of our customers participate in several market industries. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, revenue from an OEM customer primarily in the medical end market accounted for approximately 10% of our consolidated revenue. No customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenue during the year ended December 31, 2022.

Our customers include many OEMs who integrate our products into their systems for sale to end users. A typical OEM customer will usually evaluate our products and our ability to provide application knowledge and expertise, post-sales application support, supply chain management over long durations, manufacturing capabilities, product quality, global presence, and product customization before deciding to incorporate our products into their products or systems. Customers generally choose suppliers based on several factors, including product performance, reliability, application support, price, breadth of the supplier’s product offerings, the financial condition of the supplier, and the geographical coverage offered by the supplier. Once certain products have been designed into a given OEM customer’s product or system, there are generally significant barriers to subsequent supplier changes until the end of the product or system life cycle, especially in the medical market.

Seasonality

While our revenues are not highly seasonal on a consolidated basis, sales from some of our individual product lines are impacted in the first quarter by the lower seasonal spending patterns of our customers due to their annual capital budgeting cycles.

Backlog

As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our consolidated backlog was approximately $445.5 million and $473.1 million, respectively. Most orders included in backlog represent open orders for products and services that, based on management’s projections, have a reasonable probability of being delivered over the subsequent twelve months. The ability to reschedule orders included in backlog varies depending on the customer and the order. Management believes that backlog typically is not a complete indicator of future business prospects for any of our reportable segments due to the ability of customers to reschedule orders based on their updated demand, changes in customer order lead times, and potential fluctuations in our supply chain and manufacturing capacity. Therefore, backlog as of any date should not be relied upon as a complete indicator of our revenues for any future period.

Manufacturing

The majority of our manufacturing functions are performed internally, while a relatively small portion of our manufacturing processes are outsourced to highly qualified third parties primarily for cost related reasons.

Products offered by our Automation Enabling Technologies segment are manufactured at facilities in Apex, North Carolina; Bedford, Massachusetts; Marlborough, Connecticut; Mukilteo, Washington; Rocklin, California; Suzhou, China; and Taunton and Manchester, United Kingdom. Products offered by our Medical Solutions segment are primarily manufactured at facilities in Irvine, California; Mukilteo, Washington; Syracuse, New York; Ludwigsstadt, Germany; Manchester, United Kingdom, and Přelouč, Czech Republic.

The majority of our products are produced in manufacturing operations certified under either ISO 9001 certification or ISO 13485 certification. All of our manufacturing operations have been certified under ISO 14001. More than 80% of our manufacturing operations are certified under ISO 45001. Certain products, including medical insufflators and endoscopic pumps and related disposables, are manufactured under current good manufacturing practices (“cGMPs”), which is a requirement for medical devices by the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”).

6

Marketing, Sales and Distribution

We sell our products globally, primarily through our direct sales force. We also use distributors, including manufacturers’ representatives, to either augment our selling effort or serve a local market where we have no direct sales force. Our local sales, applications, and service teams and our distributors work closely with our customers to ensure customer satisfaction with our products. We have sales and service centers located in the United States, Europe and Asia.

To support our sales efforts, we maintain and continue to invest in a number of application centers around the world, where our application experts work closely with customers on integrating and using our solutions in their equipment. We currently maintain service and application centers in the United States, Europe and Asia.

Competition

We encounter strong competition in virtually all the markets, applications, and technologies we serve. Due to the wide and diverse range of products and technologies, we face many different types of competitors and competition. Our competitors range from large foreign and domestic organizations, which produce a comprehensive array of goods and services, to small organizations producing a limited number of highly specialized products or services for specialized applications. The competitive climate of many of the end market applications we serve is characterized by rapidly evolving technology and customer demands that require continuous investments by us. Our competitive success requires advances in technology and product performance, improved price-for-performance ratios, demonstrated increased throughput performance for our customers' products, lower total cost of ownership, product quality, depth of our application knowledge and expertise, reputation amongst customers, customer service and technical support, speed to market, geographical presence, and deep customer relationships.

We believe that our products offer many competitive advantages for our customers and the breadth of our technologies gives us deep applications knowledge to better serve our customers’ needs.

Raw Materials, Components and Supplies

Each of our businesses uses a wide variety of raw materials, components and parts that are generally available from alternative sources of supply and in adequate quantities from domestic and foreign sources. In some instances, we are able to design and/or re-engineer the parts and components used in our products in case of supply chain shortages. For certain raw materials, components and parts used in the production of some of our principal products, we have identified only a limited number of suppliers or, in some instances, a single source of supply. We also rely on a limited number of suppliers to manufacture subassemblies for some of our products.

For a further discussion of the importance and risks associated with our supply chain, see applicable risk factors under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Patents and Intellectual Property

We rely upon a combination of copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. We hold many registered and pending patents in the United States and other countries. In addition, we also have trademarks registered in the United States and other countries. We will continue to actively pursue applications for new patents and trademarks as we deem appropriate. However, there can be no assurance that any other patents will be issued to us or that such patents, if and when issued, will provide any protection or benefit to us.

Although we believe that our patents and pending patent applications are important, we rely upon several additional factors that are essential to our business success, including: market position, technological innovation, know-how, application knowledge and product performance. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to sustain these advantages. Considering the diversified nature of our businesses, we do not believe that any individual patent is material to our business as a whole.

We also protect our proprietary rights by controlling access to our proprietary information and by maintaining confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, and certain customers and suppliers. For a further discussion of the importance of risks associated with our intellectual property rights, see applicable risk factors under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Human Capital

We believe that our employees are our most important asset. The Chief Human Resources Officer (“CHRO”) is responsible for developing and executing our human capital strategy. This includes the acquisition, development, and retention of talent to deliver on our strategy as well as the design of employee compensation and benefits, and inclusion and belonging initiatives. The Chief

7

Executive Officer (“CEO”) and the CHRO regularly update our board of directors on the operation and status of these human capital activities, including, but not limited to, talent management, talent development, and succession planning. As of December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 3,000 people, of which approximately 41% were in the United States, 50% in Europe, and 9% in Asia. We win with our customers by delivering new technology innovations through our engineering teams of approximately 650 employees.

We believe that our employees have a meaningful role in helping us develop our culture. We utilize survey feedback mechanisms to measure employee engagement and organizational health. This enables us to gain insight into our current status and identify areas where we can improve. We have conducted six surveys of our entire employee population since 2018. We compare our employee engagement and organizational health scores against benchmark populations within our survey vendor's database. Our employee satisfaction score in the most recent survey in February 2024 was 95% of the benchmark score. This is an improvement of 5 percentage points compared to 2023. Following each survey cycle, we review the results with our teams across the Company and develop specific action plans based on the feedback we receive. We implement our action plans with the goal of improving our overall organizational health and employee engagement.

All employees are responsible for upholding the Novanta Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, which is important in delivering on our strategy. We maintain a compliance hotline for the confidential reporting of any suspected policy violations or unethical business conduct on the part of our businesses, employees, officers, directors, suppliers, or customers. We provide training and education to our global workforce with respect to our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, anti-bribery and anti-corruption policies, data privacy regulations and workplace harassment on an annual basis.

The Novanta Way

The Novanta Way defines our performance culture and begins with building cohesive teams based on trust, commitment, and accountability. Inclusion and belonging are an important part of our culture and are leader led and embedded into our ways of working. Our aim is to foster a collaborative and inclusive workplace, reflected in our governance, leadership, and technical expertise at all levels in the organization. Our policy is to not tolerate discrimination and harassment. We expect our teams to respect our core values and conduct themselves ethically at all times in accordance with the Novanta Code of Ethics and Business Conduct.

As of December 31, 2024, our board of directors was comprised of 56% men and 44% women. Individuals from underrepresented groups (defined as individuals who self-identify as Black, African American, Hispanic or Latino, Asian, Native American, Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, or two or more races or ethnicities) continued at 11% representation on our board of directors as of December 31, 2024.

During 2024, we included a series of strategic initiatives designed to foster an inclusive workforce with employees from all backgrounds. We remain committed to enhancing our recruiting processes to engage applicants from all communities. In 2024, we continued to find venues to connect with and identify qualified candidates from all backgrounds for our final interview slates.

We continue to foster an inclusive culture and promote lifelong learning by offering cultural awareness events and celebrations and integrate them into our standard work.

Our Culture Council continues to support our Employee Resources Groups (“ERGs”) and Affinity Groups (“AG”) to increase inclusion and sense of belonging among our employees leading to greater employee engagement. Our ERGs and Affinity Groups are open to all employees.

Our Localization and Development Working Team collaborated with our business units on NovantaCARES, our voluntary community outreach program, to support marginalized and underserved communities and to protect the environment. Additionally, they supported our ERGs and Affinity Groups sponsoring our first annual ERG Festival held at 13 sites around the globe. The festival created greater awareness and aided in membership recruitment to drive greater inclusion and belonging.

Compensation and Benefits

We strive to provide market competitive compensation, benefits and services that help meet the varied needs of our employees. In addition to salaries and wages, these programs, which vary by country, can include annual bonuses, sales bonus plans, stock-based compensation awards, defined contribution retirement savings plans with company matching contributions, healthcare and other insurance benefits, flexible spending accounts, health savings accounts with company matching contributions, flexible time off, paid time off, paid family leave, and tuition assistance. Certain U.S. facilities have a dedicated medical professional on site to provide basic and preventative healthcare services to employees, provide general first aid, assess employee health risks, and promote overall employee health. Additionally, all U.S. employees and their families have access to video and telephonic Telemedicine support seven

8

days a week, twenty-four hours a day. Our bonus and variable sales compensation plans allow for higher payouts when goals are exceeded and lower or no payouts when goals are not achieved as planned.

Growth and Development

We invest significant resources to develop the talent needed to remain at the forefront of innovation and make Novanta an employer of choice. In certain countries, we offer college tuition reimbursement for eligible employees for undergraduate and graduate studies. Novanta University is a company-wide learning management program that includes both internal and external training courses. We leverage the Novanta University processes and learning content to ensure all new employees have a common and complete onboarding experience. Our people leaders, with the support of our human resources organization, are accountable for ensuring that the onboarding process is complete and effective. In addition to Novanta University, we utilize our Novanta Growth System, which provides processes, tools, and training with a focus on continuous improvement.

In 2024, we continued with Leadership Development programs for our front-line and mid-level leaders.

NovantaCARES - Voluntary Community Support

We provide every employee with one paid day-off per year to volunteer at non-profit organizations supporting social charities or the environment. During 2024, approximately 33% of our employees participated in at least one NovantaCARES event, which was an increase of 8 percentage points compared to 2023.

Safety and Wellbeing of Our Employees

We provide mandatory safety training in our facilities, which are designed to focus on empowering our employees with the knowledge and tools they need to make safe choices and to mitigate risks. In further support of our employees, we offer a global health and wellness resource center, “NovantaWELL”. The resource center is a central information hub for all employees, with country-specific information on physical and mental health and wellness.

Government Regulation

Our current and contemplated activities and the products and processes that will result from such activities are subject to substantial government rules and regulations, both in the United States and internationally.

Such rules and regulations are subject to change by the governing agencies, and we monitor those changes closely.

Environmental Regulations

Most of our production facilities are subject to various federal, state, local, and/or foreign environmental regulations related to the use, storage, handling, and disposal of regulated materials, chemicals, and certain waste products.

We may face increasing complexity in our product designs and procurement operations due to the evolving nature of product compliance standards. Those standards may impact the material composition of our products entering specific markets. Such regulations went into effect in the European Union (“EU”) in 2006 (“The Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive” (“RoHS”)) and in 2007 (“Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals” (“REACH”)), and in China in 2007 (“Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products Regulation” (“China-RoHS”)).

Our capital expenditures, earnings, and competitive position have not been, and are not expected to be, materially affected by our compliance with federal, state, local and foreign environmental provisions that have been enacted or adopted to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment.

Medical Device Regulations

Certain products manufactured by us are integrated into systems by our customers that are subject to regulation by the Federal Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) and foreign regulatory authorities. We must comply with certain quality control measurements in order for our products to be effectively used in our customers’ end products. Non-compliance with quality control measurements could result in fines, penalties, and loss of business with our customers.

We are also subject to certain medical device regulations. Medical devices are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA and other federal, state, local and foreign authorities as well as notified bodies. In the United States, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) and related regulations govern the conditions of safety, efficacy, clearance, approval, manufacturing,

9

quality system requirements, labeling, packaging, distribution, storage, recordkeeping, reporting, marketing, advertising, and promotion of medical devices.

FDA Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements

Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the U.S. requires either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification or approval of a premarket approval application (“PMA”). Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes - Class I, Class II or Class III - depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s General Controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation (the “QSR”), facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General Controls and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries and FDA guidance documents. While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. The FDA’s permission to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) premarket notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are placed in Class III, requiring approval of a PMA. Some pre-amendment devices are unclassified, but are subject to the FDA’s premarket notification and clearance process in order to be commercially distributed. In many cases, our customers are responsible for compliance with the FDA’s requirements applicable to medical devices. However, we also currently market certain Class II medical device products independently that are subject to these requirements.

510(k) Marketing Clearance Pathway

To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device already on the market. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval, i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or Class I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from nine to twelve months, but may take significantly longer. The FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence.

If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the “de novo” process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device.

After a device receives 510(k) marketing clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) marketing clearance or, depending on the modification, a de novo classification or PMA approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a 510(k) or a PMA in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision and disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. Many minor modifications are accomplished by a letter-to-file in which the manufacturer documents the change in an internal letter-to-file. The letter-to-file is prepared by the manufacturer in lieu of submitting a new 510(k) to obtain clearance for every change. The FDA can always review these letters-to-file in an inspection. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or request the recall of the modified device until 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approval is obtained. In these circumstances, we may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.

Post-market Regulations

After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:

•
establishment registration and device listing with the FDA;

10

•
QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;

•
labeling and marketing regulations, which require that promotion is truthful, not misleading and fairly balanced, provide adequate directions for use and that all claims are substantiated, and also prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; 

•
FDA guidance on off-label dissemination of information and responding to unsolicited requests for information;

•
clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of the cleared devices;

•
medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device that it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur;

•
correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;

•
requirements governing Unique Device Identifiers on devices and also requiring the submission of certain information about each device to the FDA’s Global Unique Device Identification Database;

•
the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and

•
post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data on the device.

Our manufacturing processes are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file, and a complaints file. As a manufacturer, we are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Our failure to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, our manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. The discovery of previously unknown problems with any of our products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its clearance or off-label by a physician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on the device, including the removal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory device recalls.

The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that we failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions:

•
warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;

•
recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of our products;

•
operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;

•
refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approvals of new products or modified products;

•
withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted;

•
refusal to grant export or import approvals for our products; or

•
criminal prosecution.

Regulation of Medical Devices in the European Union and U.K.

The EU has adopted specific directives and regulations regulating the design, manufacture, clinical investigation, conformity assessment, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices.

Until May 25, 2021, medical devices were regulated by the Council Directive 93/42/EEC (“EU Medical Devices Directive”) which has been repealed and replaced by Regulation (EU) No 2017/745 (“EU Medical Devices Regulation”). Our current certificates have been granted and renewed under the EU Medical Devices Directive. In accordance with its recently extended transitional

11

provisions, both (i) devices lawfully placed on the market pursuant to the EU Medical Devices Directive prior to May 26, 2021 and (ii) legacy devices lawfully placed on the EU market after May 26, 2021 in accordance with the EU Medical Devices Regulation transitional provisions may generally continue to be made available on the market or put into service, provided that the requirements of the transitional provisions are fulfilled. However, as of May 26, 2021, some of the EU Medical Devices Regulation requirements apply in place of the corresponding requirements of the EU Medical Devices Directive with regard to registration of economic operators and of devices, post-market surveillance, market surveillance and vigilance requirements. Pursuing marketing of medical devices in the EU will notably require that our devices be certified under the new regime set forth in the EU Medical Devices Regulation described below.

In the EU, there is currently no premarket government review of medical devices. However, all medical devices placed on the EU market must meet general safety and performance requirements, including the requirement that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that, during normal conditions of use, it is suitable for its intended purpose. Medical devices must be safe and effective and must not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and – where applicable – other persons, provided that any risks which may be associated with their use constitute acceptable risks when weighed against the benefits to the patient and are compatible with a high level of protection of health and safety.

Compliance with the general safety and performance requirements is a prerequisite for European conformity marking (“CE mark”) without which medical devices cannot be marketed or sold in the EU. To demonstrate compliance with the general safety and performance requirements, medical device manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its risk classification. Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I non-sterile, non-measuring devices), where the manufacturer can self-assess the conformity of its products with the general safety and performance requirements (except for any parts which relate to sterility or metrology), a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body. Notified bodies are independent organizations designated by EU member states to assess the conformity of devices before being placed on the market. A notified body would typically audit and examine a product’s technical dossiers and the manufacturer’s quality system (the notified body must presume that quality systems which implement the relevant harmonized standards, such as ISO 13485:2016 for Medical Devices Quality Management Systems, conform to these requirements). If satisfied that a relevant product conforms to the relevant essential requirements, a notified body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity. The manufacturer may then apply the CE mark to the device, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the EU.

Throughout the term of the certificate of conformity, the manufacturer will be subject to periodic surveillance audits to verify continued compliance with the applicable requirements. In particular, a new audit will be required by the notified body before it will renew the relevant certificate(s).

The EU Medical Devices Regulation requires that before placing a device, other than a custom-made device, on the market, manufacturers (as well as other economic operators such as authorized representatives and importers) must register by submitting identification information to the electronic system (EUDAMED), unless they have already registered. The information to be submitted by manufacturers (and authorized representatives) also includes the name, address and contact details of the person or persons responsible for regulatory compliance. The new Regulation also requires that before placing a device, other than a custom-made device, on the market, manufacturers must assign a unique identifier to the device and provide it along with other core data to the unique device identifier (“UDI”) database. These new requirements aim at ensuring better identification and traceability of the devices. Each device – and as applicable, each package – will have a UDI composed of two parts: a device identifier (“UDI-DI”), specific to a device, and a production identifier (“UDI-PI”) to identify the unit producing the device. Manufacturers are also notably responsible for entering the necessary data on EUDAMED, which includes the UDI database, and for keeping it up to date. Certain obligations for registration in EUDAMED are expected to become applicable in Q1 2026 (as EUDAMED is not yet fully functional). Until EUDAMED is fully functional, the corresponding provisions of the EU Medical Devices Directive continue to apply for the purpose of meeting the obligations laid down in the provisions regarding exchange of information, including, and in particular, information regarding registration of devices and economic operators.

All manufacturers placing medical devices into the market in the EU must comply with the EU medical device vigilance system which has been reinforced by the EU Medical Devices Regulation. Under this system, serious incidents and Field Safety Corrective Actions (“FSCAs”) required to be taken by manufacturers must be reported to the relevant authorities of the EU member states. These reports will have to be submitted through EUDAMED – once functional – and aim to ensure that, in addition to reporting to the relevant authorities of the EU member states, other actors such as the economic operators in the supply chain will also be informed. Until EUDAMED is fully functional, the corresponding provisions of the EU Medical Devices Directive continue to apply. Manufacturers are required to take FSCAs, which are defined as any corrective action for technical or medical reasons to prevent or reduce a risk of a serious incident associated with the use of a medical device that is made available on the market. A serious incident is any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics or performance of a device on the market (e.g., inadequacy in the information supplied by the manufacturer, undesirable side-effect), which, directly or indirectly, might lead to either the death or serious

12

deterioration of the health of a patient, user, or other persons, or to a serious public health threat. An FSCA may include the recall, modification, exchange, destruction or retrofitting of the device. FSCAs must be communicated by the manufacturer or its legal representative to its customers and/or to the end users of the device through Field Safety Notices. For similar serious incidents that occur with the same device or device type and for which the root cause has been identified or a FSCA implemented or where the incidents are common and well documented, manufacturers may provide periodic summary reports instead of individual serious incident reports.

The advertising and promotion of medical devices is subject to some general principles set forth in EU legislation. According to the EU Medical Devices Regulation, only devices that are CE marked may be marketed and advertised in the EU in accordance with their intended purpose. Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising and Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, while not specific to the advertising of medical devices, also apply to the advertising thereof and contain general rules, for example, requiring that advertisements are evidenced, balanced and not misleading. Specific requirements are defined at a national level. EU member states’ laws related to the advertising and promotion of medical devices, which vary between jurisdictions, may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of products to the general public and may impose limitations on promotional activities with healthcare professionals.

Many EU member states have adopted specific anti-gift statutes that further limit commercial practices for medical devices, in particular vis-à-vis healthcare professionals and organizations. Additionally, there has been a recent trend of increased regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities and many EU member states have adopted national “Sunshine Acts” which impose reporting and transparency requirements (often on an annual basis), similar to the requirements in the United States, on medical device manufacturers. Certain countries also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs.

In the EU, regulatory authorities have the power to carry out announced and, if necessary, unannounced inspections of companies, as well as suppliers and/or sub-contractors and, where necessary, the facilities of professional users. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements (as applicable) could require time and resources to respond to the regulatory authorities’ observations and to implement corrective and preventive actions, as appropriate. Regulatory authorities have broad compliance and enforcement powers and, if such issues cannot be resolved to their satisfaction, can take a variety of actions, including untitled or warning letters, fines, consent decrees, injunctions, or civil or criminal penalties.

The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), which consists of the 27 EU member states plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.

United Kingdom

Since January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) has become the sovereign regulatory authority responsible for the medical device market in Great Britain (i.e. England, Wales and Scotland). The regulations on medical devices in Great Britain continue to be based largely on the two EU Directives (the EU Medical Devices Directive and Directive 90/385/EEC, or “EU Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive”) which preceded the EU Medical Devices Regulation, as implemented into national law by the Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (“SI 2002 No 618”, as amended) (“UK Medical Devices Regulations”). However, under the terms of the Ireland/Northern Ireland Protocol, the EU Medical Devices Regulation applies to Northern Ireland.

Furthermore, on December 16, 2024, the UK government published an amendment to the UK Medical Devices Regulations to clarify and strengthen the post-market surveillance requirements for medical devices in Great Britain. This amendment will come into force on June 16, 2025 and aims to facilitate greater traceability of incidents and trends enabling the MHRA to act swiftly when needed to address safety issues and support the entire health system in better protecting patients. Additional legislation is expected to be implemented in 2026 and aims to enable greater international collaboration and practices, with more patient-centered, proportionate requirements for medical devices which are responsive to technological advances.

Under the UK Medical Devices Regulations, in order to be lawfully placed on the Great Britain market, Class I (non-sterile, non-measuring or non-re-useable) medical devices need to be “UKCA” self-certified, and other medical devices need to be “UKCA” certified by a UK approved body. However, certain medical devices in compliance with: (1) the EU Medical Devices Directive can continue to be placed on the Great Britain market until the sooner of certificate expiration or June 30, 2028; or (2) the EU Medical Devices Regulation can continue to be placed on the Great Britain market until the sooner of certificate expiration or June 30, 2030.
