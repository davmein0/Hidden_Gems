Market Information

Our common stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol “APGE”.

Holders

As of February 24, 2025, we had approximately 6 holders of record of our common stock. This number does not include beneficial owners whose shares were held in street name.

Dividend Policy

We have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and future earnings, if any, to fund the operations and the further development and expansion of our business. We have no present intention to pay cash dividends on our common stock or non-voting common stock. Any determination to pay dividends to holders of our common stock or non-voting common stock will be at the discretion of our Board and will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, earnings, projected capital and other cash requirements, legal requirements, restrictions in the agreements governing any indebtedness we may enter into, our business prospects and other factors that our Board deems relevant.

Use of Proceeds from IPO

In July 2023, we completed our IPO pursuant to which we issued and sold an aggregate of 20,297,500 shares of our common stock, including the full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase up 2,647,500 additional shares, at the IPO price of $17.00 per share. The offer and sale of all of the shares of our common stock in the IPO were registered under the Securities Act pursuant to our Registration Statement on Form S‑1, as amended (File Nos. 333‑272831 and 333‑273236), which were declared effective on July 13, 2023. Jefferies, TD Cowen, Stifel and Guggenheim Securities acted as joint book-running managers for the IPO. Wedbush PacGrow acted as lead manager for the IPO. We received gross proceeds from our IPO of approximately $345.1 million, and net proceeds of approximately $315.4 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. None of the underwriting discounts and commissions or other offering expenses were incurred or paid, directly or indirectly, to any of our directors or officers or their associates or to persons owning 10% or more of our common stock or to any of our affiliates.

The net proceeds from the IPO have been used and are expected to be used, primarily to fund our clinical trials, including a potential Phase 2 trial, and manufacturing of our APG777 product candidate, fund our preclinical studies, clinical trials and manufacturing of our APG808 program, fund our preclinical studies, clinical trials and manufacturing of our APG990 program and fund our preclinical studies of other programs. We intend to use the remainder for our additional research and development activities, as well as for capital expenditures, working capital and general corporate purposes. There has been no material change in our intended use of proceeds from our IPO as described in the final prospectus for our IPO filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act on July 17, 2023.

Overview

We are a clinical stage biotechnology company advancing novel biologics with the potential for differentiated efficacy and dosing in the largest inflammatory and immunology (“I&I”) markets, including for the treatment of atopic dermatitis (“AD”), asthma, eosinophilic esophagitis (“EoE”), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (“COPD”), and other I&I indications. Our antibody programs are designed to overcome limitations of existing therapies by targeting well-established mechanisms of action and incorporating advanced antibody engineering to optimize half-life and other properties.

Our pipeline comprises four antibody programs being developed initially for the treatment of I&I indications as monotherapies and combinations. Our most advanced programs are APG777, APG990, APG333, and APG808. With four validated targets in our portfolio, we are seeking to achieve best-in-class efficacy and dosing through monotherapies and combinations of our novel antibodies. Based on a broad pipeline and depth of expertise, we believe we can deliver value and meaningful benefit to patients underserved by today’s standard of care. Our programs incorporate advanced antibody engineering to optimize half-life and other properties designed to overcome limitations of existing therapies. We believe each of our programs has potential for broad application across multiple I&I indications, including in combination.

APG777 – anti-IL13 antibody, same mechanism of action as EBGLYSS (lebrikizumab)

APG777 is a subcutaneous (“SQ”) extended half-life monoclonal antibody (“mAb”) targeting IL-13. In August 2023, we announced the dosing of our first participant in our first clinical trial for APG777. In 2024, we announced positive interim safety and PK data from this trial with APG777 demonstrating a potential best-in-class PK profile, including a half-life of 77 days, supporting the potential for every three- to six- month maintenance dosing in AD. Single doses of APG777 demonstrated a deep and sustained effect on PD markers out to approximately 12 months. APG777 was well-tolerated across all dose groups. In May 2024, we commenced dosing in the Phase 2 clinical trial of APG777 in patients with moderate-to-severe AD. In February 2025, we announced that the last patient in the Part A portion of the trial had been dosed with 16-week topline data from Part A expected in mid-2025. In February 2025, we also announced that we had commenced dosing of Part B of the Phase 2 trial. All patients benefiting from treatment will have the opportunity to continue to APG777 maintenance treatment, which will evaluate three- to six-month dosing intervals. We anticipate maintenance data from Part A in the first half of 2026 and 16-week topline data from Part B in the second half of 2026.

Based on our initial clinical data, we plan to advance the development of APG777 in asthma and EoE by initiating a Phase 1b trial in asthma in the first half of 2025, followed by a Phase 2b trial in asthma in the second half of 2025, and a Phase 2 trial in EoE in 2026. Based on our clinical data, we expect to further evaluate additional

106

Table of Contents

opportunities to develop APG777 for other I&I indications, including alopecia areata (“AA”), chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (“CRSwNP”), chronic spontaneous urticaria (“CSU”), and prurigo nodularis (“PN”).

In addition, we plan to evaluate APG777 in combination with other investigational therapies within our pipeline to potentially enable greater efficacy for I&I conditions. We plan to initiate our first combination study, a Phase 1b trial of APG777 and APG990, a novel, SQ, half-life extended mAb targeting OX40L, in 2025. This combination study is designed to evaluate the coformulation of APG777 and APG990 (“APG279”) against DUPIXENT in patients with moderate-to-severe AD, with readout expected in the second half of 2026.

APG990 – anti-OX40L antibody, same mechanism of action as amlitelimab; potential combination therapy with APG777

APG990 is an SQ extended half-life mAb that utilizes advanced antibody engineering to target OX40L.

We plan to develop APG777 and APG990 together as a potential first-in-class coformulation for the treatment of AD by combining deep and sustained inhibition of Type 2 inflammation via APG777’s inhibition of IL-13 with broader inhibition of Type 1-3 inflammation through APG990’s inhibition of OX40L. APG279 has been shown to retain stability, injectability, and convenience of individual components in preclinical studies. In preclinical studies, APG279 has also demonstrated broad inhibition of Type 1, Type 2 and Type 3 inflammation, similar to what was seen with Janus kinase (“JAK”) inhibition, but with potential for better tolerability than JAK inhibitors. We believe these combined mechanisms offer the potential for improved clinical responses over monotherapy while our planned approach of coformulating two extended half-life mAbs holds the potential for best-in-class dosing.

In August 2024, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of APG990 in healthy volunteers to establish safety, tolerability and PK profile, which could enable the combination with APG777.

In March 2025, we announced positive interim safety and PK data from the APG990 Phase 1 clinical trial. PK data showed a half-life of approximately 60 days across doses tested. APG990, in single doses up to 1,200mg, was well tolerated and showed a favorable safety profile, consistent with other assets targeting OX40L. In addition, preclinical toxicology studies of the combination of APG777 and APG990 showed no findings at any dose level, including the highest dose tested of 150 mg/kg per agent. Based on these results, we plan to submit an Investigational New Drug application or foreign equivalent for APG279. Following clearance, we plan to initiate in 2025 a Phase 1b trial of APG279 against DUPIXENT in approximately 50 to 75 patients with moderate-to-severe AD with a data readout expected in the second half of 2026.

APG333 – anti-TSLP antibody, same mechanism of action as TEZPIRE (tezepelumab); potential combination therapy with APG777

APG333 is a fully-human mAb against thymic stromal lymphopoietin (“TSLP”), an epithelial cell-derived cytokine that has emerged as an attractive validated target for the treatment of people living with asthma and COPD. In preclinical studies, the combination of APG777 and APG333 has been shown to impact both central inflammation and local airway responses. This has the potential to improve clinical outcomes compared to approved or in-development biologics which only target peripheral or central inflammation, not both, and retains the potential for a significantly less frequent dosing schedule. In December 2024, we initiated a Phase 1 trial of APG333 in healthy volunteers and we expect interim data from the trial in the second half of 2025.

We plan to evaluate APG777 and APG333 monotherapies in respective Phase 1b trials in patients with asthma in 2025 to support advancement into future combination trials in asthma and COPD. Subject to positive data, we plan to study APG777 in combination with APG333 to drive potential best-in-class efficacy in respiratory conditions.

APG808 – anti-IL4Rα antibody, same mechanism of action as DUPIXENT

APG808 is an SQ extended half-life mAb targeting IL-4Rα, a target with clinical validation across eight different Type 2 allergic diseases. In March 2024, we commenced dosing of the first healthy volunteers in the APG808 Phase 1 trial and in September 2024, we commenced dosing of the first asthma patients as a cohort in that Phase 1

107

Table of Contents

trial. In December 2024, we announced positive interim safety, PK and PD data from the Phase 1 trial. APG808 demonstrated a potential best-in-class PK profile, including a half-life of approximately 55 days at projected, clinically relevant steady state exposures, supporting the potential for every two- to three-month maintenance dosing. Single doses of APG808 demonstrated a deep and sustained effect on PD markers out to approximately three months (longest follow-up available at time of data cut). APG808 was well-tolerated across all dose groups. We are also now evaluating APG808 in a Phase 1b trial in patients with asthma, with data expected in the first half of 2025.

Funding and Capital Resources

Since our inception in February 2022, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to raising capital, organizing and staffing our company, business and scientific planning, conducting discovery and research activities, acquiring product programs, establishing and protecting our intellectual property portfolio, developing and progressing our pipeline, establishing arrangements with third parties for the manufacture of our programs and component materials, and providing general and administrative support for these operations. We do not have any programs approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. To date, we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from the issuance of preferred units and sale of common stock. Prior to our IPO, we received gross proceeds of $169.0 million from sales of our preferred units. On July 13, 2023, our Registration Statement on Form S-1, as amended (File Nos. 333-272831 and 333-273236) (the “IPO Registration Statement”), relating to our IPO was declared effective by the SEC. Pursuant to the IPO Registration Statement, we issued and sold an aggregate of 20,297,500 shares of common stock (inclusive of 2,647,500 shares pursuant to the exercise in full of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares) at a public offering price of $17.00 per share, for aggregate net proceeds of $315.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses.

On March 7, 2024, our Registration Statement on Form S-1, as amended (File Nos. 333-277664 and 333-277763) (the “2024 Registration Statement”), relating to our public offering (the “March 2024 Offering”) was declared effective by the SEC. Pursuant to the 2024 Registration Statement we issued and sold an aggregate of 7,790,321 shares of common stock (inclusive of 1,016,128 shares pursuant to the exercise in full of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares) at a public offering price of $62.00 per share, for aggregate net proceeds of $450.0 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses.

We have incurred significant operating losses since inception. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of any programs we may develop. We generated a net loss of $182.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $305.9 million. We expect to continue to incur significantly increased expenses for the foreseeable future if and as we:

•
advance our programs, APG777, APG990, APG333 and APG808, into and through clinical trials and regulatory approval prior to commercialization;

•
continue our research and development and preclinical development of our other programs;

•
seek and identify additional research programs and product candidates and initiate preclinical studies for those programs;

•
maintain, expand, enforce, defend and protect our intellectual property portfolio and provide reimbursement of third-party expenses related to our patent portfolio;

•
hire additional research and development and clinical personnel;

•
experience any delays, challenges, or other issues associated with the clinical development of our programs, including with respect to our regulatory strategies;

•
seek marketing approvals for any programs for which we successfully complete clinical trials;

•
develop, maintain and enhance a sustainable, scalable, reproducible and transferable manufacturing process for our programs;

•
ultimately establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any programs for which we may obtain marketing approval;

108

Table of Contents

•
add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development;

•
acquire or in-license product candidates or programs, intellectual property and technologies;

•
establish and maintain our current and any future collaborations, including making royalty, milestone or other payments thereunder; and

•
operate as a public company.

We will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully initiate and complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for any product candidates. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our programs and do not enter into a commercialization partnership, we expect to incur significant expenses related to developing our commercialization capability to support product sales, manufacturing, marketing, and distribution. Further, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company, including increased costs of accounting, audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements, director and officer insurance costs and investor and public relations costs.

As a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continued operations and growth strategy. Until such a time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through the sale of equity, debt financings or other capital sources, including collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as, and when, needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and commercialization of one or more of our programs.

Because of the numerous risks associated with product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate product sales, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.

We expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents of $141.8 million, marketable securities of $378.9 million and long-term marketable securities of $210.4 million as of December 31, 2024, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the first quarter of 2028. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we currently expect. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information.

Reorganization

Apogee Therapeutics, LLC was formed as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of Delaware in February 2022. Apogee Therapeutics, Inc. was incorporated in June 2023 in connection with our IPO to serve as a holding company that would wholly own the assets of Apogee Therapeutics, LLC.

Collaboration, License and Services Agreements

Paragon Option Agreements

In February 2022, we entered into an antibody discovery and option agreement with Paragon, which was subsequently amended in November 2022 (as amended, the “2022 Option Agreement”). Under the terms of the 2022 Option Agreement, Paragon identifies, evaluates and develops antibodies directed against certain mutually agreed therapeutic targets of interest to us. The 2022 Option Agreement initially included two selected targets, IL-13 and IL-4Rα, and was subsequently amended in November 2022 to include an additional selected target, OX40L. Under the 2022 Option Agreement, we have the exclusive option to, on a research program-by-research program basis, be granted an exclusive, worldwide license to all of Paragon’s right, title and interest in and to the intellectual property resulting from the applicable research program to develop, manufacture and commercialize the antibodies and products directed to the selected targets (each, an “Option”). From time to time, we can choose to add additional targets to the collaboration by mutual agreement with Paragon.

Pursuant to the terms of the 2022 Option Agreement, the parties initiated certain research programs that generally focused on a particular target (each, a “Research Program”). Each Research Program is aimed at discovering, generating, identifying and/or characterizing antibodies directed to the respective target. For each Research Program, the parties established a research plan that sets forth the activities that will be conducted, and the associated research budget (each, a “Research Plan”). Upon execution of the 2022 Option Agreement, we agreed with Paragon on an initial Research Plan that outlined the services that will be performed commencing at inception of the arrangement related to IL-13 and IL-4Rα. The Research Plan for OX40L was agreed to prior to December 31, 2022. Our exclusive option with respect to any future Research Program is exercisable at our sole discretion at any time during the period beginning on the initiation of activities under the associated Research Program and ending a specified number of days following the delivery of the data package from Paragon related to the results of the Research Plan activities (the “Option Period”). There is no payment due upon exercise of an Option pursuant to the 2022 Option Agreement.

In consideration for the exclusive options granted under the 2022 Option Agreement, we paid an upfront cash amount of $1.3 million and issued 1,250,000 common units to Paragon. Paragon was also entitled to up to an additional 3,750,000 of common units in exchange for the rights granted under the 2022 Option Agreement, which were issued in connection with the closings of the additional tranches of the Series A Preferred Unit financing. Under the 2022 Option Agreement, on a Research Program-by-Research Program basis following the finalization of the Research Plan for each respective Research Program, we are required to pay Paragon a nonrefundable fee in cash of $0.5 million. We are also obligated to compensate Paragon on a quarterly basis for its services performed under each Research Program based on the actual costs incurred.

In November 2023, we entered into an additional antibody discovery and option agreement with Paragon (the “2023 Option Agreement” and together with the 2022 Option Agreement, collectively, the “Option Agreements”). Under the terms of the 2023 Option Agreement, Paragon identifies, evaluates and develops antibodies directed against certain mutually agreed therapeutic targets of interest to us. The 2023 Option Agreement initially includes one target, TSLP. Under the 2023 Option Agreement, we have the exclusive option to, on a research program-by-research program basis, be granted an exclusive, worldwide license to all of Paragon’s right, title and interest in and to the intellectual property resulting from the applicable research program to develop, manufacture and commercialize the antibodies and products directed to the selected targets. From time to time, we can choose to add additional targets to the collaboration by mutual agreement with Paragon.

Pursuant to the terms of the 2023 Option Agreement, the parties may initiate Research Programs. Each Research Program will be aimed at discovering, generating, identifying and/or characterizing antibodies directed to the respective target. For each Research Program, the parties must establish a Research Plan. In January 2024, we agreed

110

Table of Contents

on an initial Research Plan with Paragon that outlines the services that will be performed commencing at inception of the arrangement related to TSLP. Our exclusive option with respect to each Research Program is exercisable at our sole discretion at any time during the period beginning on the initiation of activities under the associated Research Program and ending a specified number of days following the delivery of the data package from Paragon related to the results of the Research Plan activities. There is no payment due upon exercise of an Option pursuant to the 2023 Option Agreement.

Under the 2023 Option Agreement, on a Research Program-by-Research Program basis following the finalization of the Research Plan for each respective Research Program, we are required to pay Paragon a nonrefundable fee in cash of $2.0 million. We are also obligated to compensate Paragon on a quarterly basis for its services performed under each Research Program based on the actual costs incurred. We expense the service fees as the associated costs are incurred when the underlying services are rendered. In January 2024, we finalized the Research Plan with Paragon related to the TSLP target. As such, we made a one-time non-refundable payment of $2.0 million to Paragon in the first quarter of 2024.

 Unless terminated earlier, the Option Agreements shall continue in force on a Research Program-by-Research Program basis until the earlier of: (i) the end of the Option Period for such Research Program, as applicable, if such Option is not exercised by us; and (ii) the effective date of the license agreement for such Research Program if we exercise our Option with respect to such Research Program (the “Term”). Upon the expiration of the Term for all then-existing Research Programs, the applicable Option Agreement will automatically expire in its entirety. We may terminate either Option Agreement or any Research Program at any time for any or no reason upon 30 days’ prior written notice to Paragon, provided that we must pay certain unpaid fees due to Paragon upon such termination, as well as any non-cancellable obligations reasonably incurred by Paragon in connection with its activities under any terminated Research Program. Each party has the right to terminate either Option Agreement or any Research Program upon (i) 30 days’ prior written notice of the other party’s material breach that remains uncured for the 30-day period and (ii) the other party’s bankruptcy.

Paragon License Agreements

In November 2022, we exercised our option available under the 2022 Option Agreement with respect to the IL-13 Research Program. Upon such exercise, the parties entered into an associated license agreement (the “IL-13 License Agreement”). In April 2023, we exercised our option available under the 2022 Option Agreement with respect to the IL-4Rα Research Program and the OX40L Research Program. Upon such exercise, the parties entered into associated license agreements (the “IL-4Rα License Agreement” and the “OX40L License Agreement,” respectively). In August 2024, we exercised our option available under the 2023 Option Agreement with respect to the TSLP Research Program and entered into the associated license agreement (the “TSLP License Agreement,” and collectively with the IL-13 License Agreement, the IL-4Rα License Agreement and the OX40L License Agreement, the “License Agreements”). Under the terms of the License Agreements, Paragon granted to us an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable right and license with respect to certain information, patent rights and sequence information related to antibodies directed at the respective target to use, make, sell, import, export and otherwise exploit the antibodies directed at the respective target. Pursuant to the License Agreements, we granted to Paragon a similar license (except that such license we granted to Paragon is non-exclusive) to the respective licenses with respect to multispecific antibodies that are directed at the respective targets and one or more other antibodies. We were also granted a right of first negotiation with Paragon concerning the development, license and grant of rights to certain multispecific antibodies associated with each respective license. We are solely responsible for the continued development, manufacture and commercialization of products at our own cost and expense for each licensed target.

Under the IL-13 License Agreement, the IL-4Rα License Agreement and the OX40L License Agreement, we are obligated to pay Paragon up to $3.0 million upon the achievement of specific development and clinical milestones for the first product under each of the License Agreements that achieves such specified milestones, including a payment of $1.0 million upon the nomination of a development candidate and $2.0 million upon the first dosing of a human patient in a Phase 1 trial. Under the TSLP License Agreement, we are obligated to pay Paragon up to $28.0 million upon the achievement of specific development and clinical milestones for the first product, including a payment of $3.0 million upon the nomination of a development candidate and $5.0 million upon the first dosing of a human patient in a Phase 1 trial.

Upon execution of the IL-13 License Agreement, we paid Paragon a $1.0 million fee for the nomination of a development candidate. In August 2023, we announced the dosing of our first participants in the Phase 1 trial of

111

APG777 and made a milestone payment of $2.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. In November 2023, we finalized the nomination of a development candidate under the IL-4Rα License Agreement and made a milestone payment of $1.0 million to Paragon in the fourth quarter of 2023. In March 2024, we announced the dosing of our first participants in a Phase 1 trial of APG808 and made a milestone payment of $2.0 million to Paragon in the first quarter of 2024. In May 2024, we finalized the nomination of a development candidate under the OX40L License Agreement and made a milestone payment of $1.0 million to Paragon in the second quarter of 2024. In August 2024, we announced the dosing of our first participants in the Phase 1 trial of APG990 and made a milestone payment of $2.0 million in the third quarter of 2024. In October 2024, we finalized the nomination of a development candidate under the TSLP License Agreement and made a milestone payment of $3.0 million to Paragon in the fourth quarter of 2024. In December 2024, we announced the dosing of our first participant in the Phase 1 trial of APG333 and made a milestone payment of $5.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2024.

We are also obligated to pay royalties to Paragon equal to a low-single digit percentage of net sales of any products under each of the respective License Agreements, and Paragon has a similar obligation to pay royalties to us with respect to each of the multispecific licenses. Royalties are due on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis beginning upon the first commercial sale of each product and ending on the later of (i) 12 years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country and (ii) expiration of the last valid claim of a patent covering such product in such country.

Biologics Master Services Agreement - WuXi Biologics (Hong Kong) Limited

In June 2022, Paragon and WuXi Biologics (Hong Kong) Limited (“WuXi Biologics”) entered into a biologics master services agreement (the “WuXi Biologics MSA”), which was subsequently novated to us by Paragon in the second quarter of 2023. The WuXi Biologics MSA governs all development activities and GMP manufacturing and testing for our APG777, APG990, APG333 and APG808 programs, as well as potential future programs, on a work order basis. Under the WuXi Biologics MSA, we are obligated to pay WuXi Biologics a service fee and all non-cancellable obligations in the amount specified in each work order associated with the agreement for the provision of services.

The WuXi Biologics MSA terminates on the later of (i) June 20, 2027 or (ii) the completion of services under all work orders executed by the parties prior to June 20, 2027, unless terminated earlier. The term of each work order terminates upon completion of the services under such work order, unless terminated earlier. We can terminate the WuXi Biologics MSA or any work order at any time upon 30 days’ prior written notice and immediately upon written notice if WuXi Biologics fails to obtain or maintain required material governmental licenses or approvals. Either party may terminate a work order (i) at any time upon six months’ prior notice with reasonable cause, provided however that if WuXi Biologics terminates a work order in such manner, no termination or cancellation fees shall be paid by us and (ii) immediately for cause upon (a) the other party’s material breach that remains uncured for 30 days after notice of such breach, (b) the other party’s bankruptcy or (c) a force majeure event that prevents performance for a period of at least 90 days.

Cell Line License Agreement — WuXi Biologics (Hong Kong) Limited

In June 2022, Paragon and WuXi Biologics entered into a cell line license agreement (the “Cell Line License Agreement”), which was subsequently novated to us by Paragon in the second quarter of 2023. Under the Cell Line License Agreement, we received a non-exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license to certain of WuXi Biologics’ know-how, cell line, biological materials (the “WuXi Biologics Licensed Technology”) and media and feeds to make, have made, use, sell and import certain therapeutic products produced through the use of the cell line licensed by WuXi Biologics under the Cell Line License Agreement (the “WuXi Biologics Licensed Products”). Specifically, the WuXi Biologics Licensed Technology is used to manufacture a component of the APG777, APG990, APG333 and APG808 programs.

In consideration for the license, we have paid WuXi Biologics a non-refundable license fee of $150,000. Additionally, if we manufacture all of our commercial supplies of bulk drug product with a manufacturer other than WuXi Biologics or its affiliates, we are required to make royalty payments to WuXi Biologics in an amount equal to a fraction of a single digit percentage of global net sales of WuXi Biologics Licensed Products manufactured by a third-party manufacturer (the “Royalty”). If we manufacture part of our commercial supplies of the WuXi Biologics

112

Table of Contents

Licensed Products with WuXi Biologics or its affiliates, then the Royalty will be reduced accordingly on a pro rata basis.

The Cell Line License Agreement will continue indefinitely unless terminated (i) by us upon six months’ prior written notice and our payment of all undisputed amounts due to WuXi Biologics through the effective date of termination, (ii) by WuXi Biologics for a material breach by us that remains uncured for 60 days after written notice, (iii) by WuXi Biologics if we fail to make a payment and such failure continues for 30 days after receiving notice of such failure, or (iv) by either party upon the other party’s bankruptcy.

Letter of Intent — Samsung Biologics Limited

In the fourth quarter of 2024, we executed a Letter of Intent for the manufacturing of drug product with Samsung Biologics, under which we recognized $9.9 million of research and development expenses.

Overview of Financial Results

Revenue

We have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products for several years, if at all. If our development efforts for our programs are successful and result in regulatory approval or collaboration or license agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from product sales or payments from collaboration or license agreements that we may enter into with third parties, or any combination thereof.

Operating Expenses

Our operating expenses consist of (i) research and development expenses and (ii) general and administrative expenses.

Research and Development

Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred in connection with the development and research of our programs. These expenses include:

•
costs of funding research performed by third parties, including Paragon, that conduct research and development and preclinical or clinical activities on our behalf;

•
the cost to acquire in-process research and development, with no alternative future use associated with asset acquisitions, such as the Option Agreements, and License Agreements;

•
expenses incurred in connection with continuing our current research programs and preclinical development of any programs we may identify, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants and contractors;

•
the cost of developing and validating our manufacturing process for use in our preclinical studies and current and future clinical trials; and

•
personnel-related expenses, including salaries, bonuses and equity-based compensation expense.

We measure and recognize asset acquisitions or licenses to intellectual property that are not deemed to be business combinations based on the cost to acquire or license the asset or group of assets, which includes transaction costs. In an asset acquisition or license to intellectual property, the cost allocated to acquired in-process research and development, with no alternative future use is recognized as research and development expense on the acquisition date.

We expense research and development costs as incurred. Non-refundable advance payments that we make for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid

113

Table of Contents

expenses. The prepaid amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed, or when it is no longer expected that the goods will be delivered or the services rendered.

Our primary focus since inception has been the identification and development of our pipeline programs. Our research and development costs primarily consist of external costs, such as fees paid to Paragon under the Option Agreements and the License Agreements. We do not separately track or segregate the amount of costs incurred under the Option Agreement due to the early-stage and discovery nature of the services. We do not allocate personnel-related costs by program because these resources are used and these costs are deployed across multiple programs under development, and, as such, are not separately classified.

We expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in research and development activities related to the continued development of our programs, developing any future programs, including investments in manufacturing, as we advance any programs we may identify and continue to conduct clinical trials. The success of programs we may identify and develop will depend on many factors, including the following:

•
timely and successful completion of preclinical studies;

•
effective INDs or comparable foreign applications that allow commencement of our planned clinical trials or future clinical trials for any programs we may develop;

•
successful enrollment and completion of clinical trials;

•
positive results from our future clinical trials that support a finding of safety and effectiveness, acceptable PK profile, and an acceptable risk-benefit profile in the intended populations;

•
receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;

•
establishment of arrangements through our own facilities or with third-party manufacturers for clinical supply and, where applicable, commercial manufacturing capabilities;

•
establishment, maintenance, defense and enforcement of patent, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property protection or regulatory exclusivity for any products we may develop; and

•
maintenance of a continued acceptable safety, tolerability and efficacy profile of any programs we may develop following approval.

Any changes in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of programs that we may identify could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of such programs. For example, if the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a program, or if we experience significant delays in our clinical trials due to patient enrollment or other reasons, we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development. We may never obtain regulatory approval for any of our programs.

General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, including salaries, bonuses, and equity-based compensation, for individuals in our executive, finance, legal, operations, human resources, business development, commercial and other administrative functions. Other significant general and administrative expenses include legal fees relating to corporate matters, professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and administrative consulting services, insurance costs and recruiting costs. These costs relate to the operation of the business, unrelated to the research and development function, or any individual program.

We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase substantially for the foreseeable future as we increase our headcount to support the expected growth in our research and development activities and the potential commercialization of our programs, if approved. We also expect to continue incurring expenses associated with being a public company, including increased costs of accounting, audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated

114

with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements, director and officer insurance costs, and investor and public relations costs.

Other Income (Expense), Net

Interest Income

Interest income consists of interest income earned from our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and amortization of investment discounts.

Income Taxes

Since our inception, we have not recorded any income tax benefits for the net losses we have incurred or for the research and development tax credits generated in each period as we believe, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that all of our net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards and the vast majority of our tax credit carryforwards will not be realized.

As of December 31, 2024, we had U.S. federal NOL carryforwards of approximately $68.1 million, which may be available to reduce future taxable income and have an indefinite carryforward period but are limited in their usage to an annual deduction equal to 80% of annual taxable income. We also had state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $28.5 million, which will begin to expire in 2043 for state tax purposes. As of December 31, 2024, we also had U.S. federal and research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $10.5 million, which may be available to reduce future tax liabilities. We also had California research and development credit carryforwards of approximately $1.5 million. Additionally, we had Massachusetts research and development credit carryforwards of approximately $2.1 million. The U.S. federal and Massachusetts research and development tax credit carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in 2042 and the California research and development tax credit carryforwards do not expire. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets at the balance sheet date.

External research and development costs for APG990/APG279 for the year ended December 31, 2023 were recorded as unallocated external discovery related costs as the development candidate for APG990 was nominated in May 2024.

(2)
External research and development costs for APG333/APG777+APG333 for the year ended December 31, 2023 were recorded as unallocated external discovery related costs as the development candidate for APG333 was nominated in October 2024.

Research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $167.9 million and $68.4 million, respectively. The increase of $99.5 million was primarily driven by further development of our APG777, APG990/APG279 and APG333/APG777+APG333 programs and advancement of our pipeline into clinical trials, as well as increases in personnel costs and equity-based compensation expense, associated with the growth in our research and development team.

Research and development expense related to the APG777 program for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $49.2 million and $21.6 million, respectively. The increase of $27.6 million was primarily driven by an increase in clinical trial-related expenses and clinical manufacturing activities to support our Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded $20.0 million of research and development expense related to the APG990/APG279 program, which included milestone payments of $1.0 million and $2.0 million to Paragon, related to the nomination of a development candidate in May 2024 and the first dosing of a human patient in a Phase 1 clinical trial in August 2024, respectively. No such expenses were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2023, as APG990/APG279 expenses were recorded as unallocated external-discovery related costs until the program candidate was nominated in 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded $28.1 million of research and development expenses related to the APG333/APG333+APG777 program, which included a $2.0 million research initiation fee and milestone payments of $3.0 million and $5.0 million to Paragon related to the nomination of a development candidate in October 2024 and the first dosing of a human patient in a Phase 1 clinical trial in December 2024, respectively. No such expenses were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2023, as expenses related to the APG333/APG333+APG777 program were recorded as unallocated external-discovery related costs until the program candidate was nominated in 2024. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we recorded $10.3 million and $20.8 million of research and development expense related to the APG808 program, respectively. The decrease of $10.5 million was primarily driven by decreased clinical manufacturing activities in 2024.

 Personnel-related expenses and equity-based compensation increased by $29.6 million and $8.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2024, respectively, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily driven by increased headcount and an increase in the fair value of equity awards granted. External-discovery related costs and other expenses decreased by $3.9 million, primarily driven by the nomination of development candidates under APG333/APG777+APG333 and APG990/APG279 in 2024, as expenses related to the programs were recorded as unallocated external-discovery related costs until the program candidates were nominated in 2024.

General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $49.0 million, compared to $24.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase of $24.4 million was primarily due to increases of $8.9 million and $8.9 million in personnel related expense and equity-based compensation, respectively, primarily driven by increased headcount and an increase in the fair value of equity awards granted. Additionally, other general and administrative expenses increased $4.6 million, primarily due to increases in IT related costs, D&O insurance and other employee related expenses. The increase in total general and administrative expenses were the result of the expansion of our operations to support the growth in our business and the cost of operating as a public company.

Other Income, Net

Interest income increased $25.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, which was primarily related to interest on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Sources of Liquidity

Since our inception, we have incurred significant losses. We have not yet commercialized any of our programs, which are in various phases of early-stage development, and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of any of our programs for several years, if at all. To date, we have financed our operations from the proceeds from the issuance of preferred units and the sale of common stock in our IPO, our March 2024 Offering and our ATM Facility (as defined below). As of December 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $141.8 million, marketable securities of $378.9 million and long-term marketable securities of $210.4 million.

Prior to our IPO, we received gross proceeds of $169.0 million from sales of our preferred units. In connection with our IPO in July 2023, we issued and sold an aggregate of 20,297,500 shares of common stock (inclusive of 2,647,500 shares pursuant to the exercise in full of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares) at a price of $17.00 per share for aggregate net proceeds of $315.4 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. In connection with our March 2024 Offering, we issued and sold an aggregate of 7,790,321 shares of common stock (inclusive of 1,016,128 shares pursuant to the exercise in full of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares) at a public offering price of $62.00 per share, for aggregate net proceeds of $450.0 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses.

In August 2024, we entered into an Open Market Sale Agreement (the “Sale Agreement”) with Jefferies LLC (the “Sales Agent”), pursuant to which we may offer and sell shares of common stock up to a maximum aggregate offering price of $300.0 million, from time to time, through an at the market offering program (the “ATM Facility”). During the three months ended December 31, 2024, we sold 926,049 shares of common stock under the ATM at a price per share of $48.50 resulting in net proceeds of $43.6 million. As of December 31, 2024, $255.1 million remained available for sale under the Sale Agreement.

Net Cash used in Operating Activities

Cash used in operating activities resulted primarily from our net losses adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in components of operating assets and liabilities, which are generally attributable to timing of payments, and the related effect on certain account balances, operational and strategic decisions and contracts to which we may be a party.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, operating activities used $171.2 million of cash, primarily due to a net loss of $182.1 million and amortization of discounts on marketable securities of $12.2 million. This was partially offset by non-cash charges of $23.3 million for equity-based compensation and $1.7 million for lease expense.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, operating activities used $74.8 million of cash, primarily due to a net loss of $84.0 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $6.1 million for equity-based compensation and net changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $6.1 million.

Net Cash used in Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $300.5 million, primarily related to the $649.5 million purchase of marketable securities and $1.1 million purchase of property and equipment. This was partially offset by the maturities of $350.1 million of marketable securities.

Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $273.9 million, which was primarily related to the $303.7 million purchase of marketable securities, partially offset by the maturities of $30.0 million in marketable securities.

Net Cash provided by Financing Activities

For the year ended December 31, 2024, financing activities provided $495.1 million of cash, primarily related to the issuance and sale of common stock from our March 2024 Offering, net of paid issuance costs, and the issuance of common stock under our ATM Facility in December 2024.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, financing activities provided $315.4 million of cash related to the issuance and sale of common stock from our IPO, net of paid issuance costs.

Future Funding Requirements

To date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales. We do not expect to generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete preclinical and clinical development of, receive regulatory approval for, and commercialize a program and we do not know when, or if at all, that will occur. We expect our expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance the preclinical activities and studies and initiate clinical trials. In addition, if we obtain regulatory approval for any programs, we expect to incur significant expenses related to product sales, marketing, and distribution to the extent that such sales, marketing and distribution are not the responsibility of potential collaborators. We expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. The timing and amount of our operating expenditures will depend

118

Table of Contents

largely on the factors set out above. For more information, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Limited Operating History, Financial Position and Capital Requirements.”

Our funding requirements and timing and amount of our operating expenditures will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:

•
the rate of progress in the development of our APG777, APG990, APG333 and APG808 programs;

•
the scope, progress, results and costs of preclinical studies and clinical trials for any other current and future programs;

•
the number and characteristics of programs and technologies that we develop or may in-license;

•
the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, for any of our programs for which we receive marketing approval;

•
the costs necessary to obtain regulatory approvals, if any, for any approved products in the United States and other jurisdictions, and the costs of post-marketing studies that could be required by regulatory authorities in jurisdictions where approval is obtained;

•
the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims;

•
the continuation of our existing licensing arrangements and entry into new collaborations and licensing arrangements;

•
the costs we incur in maintaining business operations;

•
the costs of hiring additional clinical, quality control, manufacturing and other scientific personnel;

•
the costs adding operational, financial and management information systems and personnel;

•
the costs associated with being a public company;

•
the costs and timing of future laboratory facilities;

•
the revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our programs for which we receive marketing approval;

•
the effect of competing technological and market developments; and

•
the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products and technologies, including entering into licensing or collaboration arrangements for programs.

Identifying potential programs and product candidates and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials is a time consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our programs, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of products that we do not expect to be commercially available for many years, if ever. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funds to achieve our business objectives.

Adequate additional funds may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. We do not currently have any committed external source of funds. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, our stockholders’ ownership interests could be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that could adversely affect our stockholders’ rights.

Additional debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends, and may require the issuance of warrants, which could potentially dilute our stockholders’ ownership interests.

119

Table of Contents

If we raise additional funds through strategic collaborations or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs, or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit or terminate our product development programs or any future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates to third parties that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.

As of December 31, 2024, we had $141.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, $378.9 million of marketable securities and $210.4 million of long-term marketable securities. Based on our current operating plan, as of the date of this Annual Report, we estimate that our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and long-term marketable securities will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next 12 months following the issuance of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Moreover, based on our current operating plan, we estimate that such funds will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the first quarter of 2028. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect.

Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments

We enter into contracts in the normal course of business with contract research organizations (“CROs”), contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”) and other third parties for preclinical research studies and testing, clinical trials, manufacturing and other services. These contracts do not contain any minimum purchase commitments and provide for termination by us upon prior written notice. Payments due upon cancellation consist only of payments for services provided and expenses incurred up to the date of cancellation, including non-cancelable obligations of our service providers and, in some cases, wind-down costs. The exact amounts of such obligations are dependent on the timing of termination and the terms of the associated agreement. Accordingly, these payments are not disclosed as the amount and timing of such payments are not known.

Our agreements to license intellectual property include potential milestone payments that are dependent upon the development of products using the intellectual property licensed under the agreements and contingent upon the achievement of specific development and clinical milestones. As of December 31, 2024, we have incurred $17.0 million of the maximum aggregate potential milestone payments. We are also obligated to pay royalties to (i) Paragon at a royalty rate of a low single-digit percentage based on net sales of any products under the License Agreements, once commercialized and (ii) WuXi Biologics at a royalty rate of a fraction of a single digit percentage of global net sales of WuXi Biologics Licensed Products manufactured by a third-party manufacturer.

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to become material to our financial condition or results of operations.

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates

Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenues recognized and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We define our critical accounting policies as those accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America that are most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report, we believe the following accounting policies used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements require the most significant judgments and estimates.

120

Table of Contents

Research and Development Expense

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses consist of costs incurred in performing research and development activities, including salaries and bonuses, overhead costs, contract services and other related costs. The value of goods and services received from CROs and CMOs in the reporting period are estimated based on the level of services performed, and progress in the period in cases when we have not received an invoice from the supplier. In circumstances where amounts have been paid in excess of costs incurred, we record a prepaid expense. When billing terms under these contracts do not coincide with the timing of when the work is performed, we are required to make estimates of outstanding obligations to those third parties as of period end. Any accrual estimates are based on a number of factors, including our knowledge of the progress towards completion of the specific tasks to be performed, invoicing to date under the contracts, communication from the vendors of any actual costs incurred during the period that have not yet been invoiced and the costs included in the contracts. Significant judgments and estimates may be made in determining the accrued balances at the end of any reporting period. Actual results could differ from the estimates made by us.

JOBS Act Transition Period and Smaller Reporting Company Status

As of June 30, 2024, the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700 million, and as a result, as of January 1, 2025, we no longer qualified as an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”) or as a “smaller reporting company,” as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). We have transitioned to a large accelerated filer, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. As a large accelerated filer, and subject to applicable transition periods, we are subject to certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that were not applicable to us as an emerging growth company and smaller reporting company, including compliance with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and full disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation. Additionally, we are no longer able to take advantage of transition periods for complying with new or revised accounting standards that are available to emerging growth companies.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

We have reviewed all recently issued accounting standards and have determined that, other than as disclosed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report, such standards are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or do not otherwise apply to our operations.

Item 7A
. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are no longer a smaller reporting company and have transitioned to a large accelerated filer, each as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. In accordance with SEC rules for this transition, we are not required to provide information under this item.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Apogee Therapeutics, Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apogee Therapeutics, Inc.  (the Company) as of  December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated March 3, 2025
 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Accrued Manufacturing Expenses

Description of

the Matter

The Company’s accrued manufacturing expenses balance totaled $15.5 million as of December 31, 2024. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company estimates the value of goods and services received in the reporting period based on the level of services performed, and progress in the period in cases

123

Table of Contents

when the Company has not received an invoice from the supplier. The Company makes these estimates based on a number of factors, including the Company’s knowledge of progress towards completion of certain tasks to be performed, invoicing to date under the contracts, communication from vendors of any actual costs incurred during the period that have not yet been invoiced and the costs included in the contracts. Payments for such activities are based on the terms of the individual arrangements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred.
Auditing the Company’s accrued manufacturing expenses was complex in the context of our audit due to the volume of the Company’s manufacturing activities. Furthermore, due to the duration of the Company’s  manufacturing programs, and the timing of information received from third parties, the actual amounts incurred may not be known at the time the consolidated financial statements are issued.

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

To evaluate accrued manufacturing expenses, our audit procedures included, among others, testing the accuracy and completeness of the underlying data used by management to determine the accruals. We evaluated the progress of manufacturing activities through discussion with the Company’s personnel that oversee the Company’s programs and inspected the Company’s contracts with third parties and any pending change orders to assess the impact on amounts recorded. In addition, we compared management’s assessment of costs incurred to date to confirmations obtained directly from third parties. We also analyzed fluctuations in accruals by vendor and by program throughout the period subject to audit and tested subsequent invoices received from third parties.

We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2023.

APOGEE THERAPEUTICS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLID
ATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.
Nature of the Business
Apogee Therapeutics, Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, “Apogee” or the “Company”), a successor to Apogee Therapeutics, LLC, is a clinical-stage biotechnology company advancing novel biologics with potential for differentiated efficacy and dosing in the largest inflammatory and immunology (“I&I”) markets, including for the treatment of atopic dermatitis (“AD”), asthma, eosinophilic esophagitis (“EoE”), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (“COPD”) and other I&I indications. Apogee’s antibody programs are designed to overcome limitations of existing therapies by targeting well-established mechanisms of action and incorporating advanced antibody engineering to optimize half-life and other properties.

The Company commenced its operations in February 2022 as a Delaware limited liability company named Apogee Therapeutics, LLC. The Company was founded by leading healthcare investors, Fairmount Funds Management LLC and Venrock Healthcare Capital Partners and has since assembled a management team of drug developers and an executive team with significant experience in clinical development, manufacturing of biologics and leading public biopharmaceutical company operations, financing and transactions. As a result of the Reorganization (as defined below) and in connection with the Company’s initial public offering (“IPO”) in July 2023, the Company directly wholly owns the assets of Apogee Therapeutics, LLC, including the stock of its subsidiary. In addition, the Company engages third parties, including Paragon Therapeutics, Inc. (“Paragon”), who is also a related party, to perform ongoing research and development and other services on its behalf.
In February 2022, the Company entered into an antibody discovery and option agreement with Paragon, which was subsequently amended in November 2022 (as amended, the “2022 Option Agreement”). Under the terms of the 2022 Option Agreement, Paragon identifies, evaluates and develops antibodies directed against certain mutually agreed therapeutic targets of interest to the Company. The 2022 Option Agreement initially included 
two
 selected targets, IL-13 and IL-4Rα, and was subsequently amended in November 2022 to include an additional selected target, OX40L. Under the 2022 Option Agreement, the Company has the exclusive option to, on a research program-by-research program basis, be granted an exclusive, worldwide license to all of Paragon’s rights, title and interest in and to the intellectual property resulting from the applicable research program to develop, manufacture and commercialize the antibodies and products directed to the selected targets. In November 2023, the Company entered into an additional antibody discovery and option agreement for the thymic stromal lymphopoietin (“TSLP”) target with Paragon (the “2023 Option Agreement” and, together with the 2022 Option Agreement, collectively the “Option Agreements”). Under the terms of the 2023 Option Agreement, Paragon identifies, evaluates and develops antibodies directed against certain mutually agreed therapeutic targets of interest to the Company.
In November 2022, the Company exercised its option available under the 2022 Option Agreement with respect to the IL-13 Research Program (as defined below) and, in April 2023, the Company exercised its options available under the 2022 Option Agreement with respect to the IL-4Rα Research Program and the OX40L Research Program. Upon such exercises, the parties entered into associated license agreements for each target. Under the terms of each license agreement, Paragon granted to the Company an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable right and license with respect to certain information, patent rights and sequence information related to antibodies directed at the respective target to use, make, sell, import, export and otherwise exploit the antibodies directed at the respective target. In August 2024, the Company exercised its option under the 2023 Option Agreement with the respect to the TSLP Research Program. The Company is solely responsible for the development, manufacture and commercialization of IL-13, IL-4Rα, OX40L and TSLP product candidates and products at its own cost and expense.
On July 13, 2023, the Company completed a reorganization, pursuant to which the members of Apogee Therapeutics, LLC contributed their units in Apogee Therapeutics, LLC to Apogee Therapeutics, Inc. in exchange for shares of common stock or non-voting common stock of Apogee Therapeutics, Inc. (the “Reorganization”), as follows:
•
holders of Series A Preferred Units of Apogee Therapeutics, LLC received 
7,678,000
 shares of non-voting common stock of Apogee Therapeutics, Inc.;

130

Table of Contents

•
holders of Series B Preferred Units of Apogee Therapeutics, LLC received 
11,501,108
 shares of common stock and 
5,808,642
 shares of non-voting common stock of Apogee Therapeutics, Inc.;
•
holders of common units of Apogee Therapeutics, LLC received 
1,919,500
 shares of common stock of Apogee Therapeutics, Inc.; 
•
holders of vested incentive units of Apogee Therapeutics, LLC received 
690,188
 shares of common stock of Apogee Therapeutics, Inc.; and 
•
holders of unvested incentive units of Apogee Therapeutics, LLC received 
2,779,358
 shares of restricted common stock of Apogee Therapeutics, Inc.
In July 2023, the Company completed its IPO, pursuant to which it issued and sold an aggregate of 
20,297,500
 shares of its common stock (inclusive of 
2,647,500
 shares pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment option in full) at the IPO price of $
17.00
 per share for net cash proceeds of $
315.4
 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. The shares of Apogee Therapeutics, Inc. began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market on July 14, 2023 under the symbol APGE. On March 12, 2024, the Company issued and sold an aggregate of 
7,790,321
 shares of its common stock (inclusive of 
1,016,128
 shares pursuant to the exercise in full of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares) at a public offering price of $
62.00
 per share, for aggregate net proceeds of $
450.0
 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses.
The Company is subject to risks and uncertainties common to early stage companies in the biotechnology industry, including, but not limited to, completing preclinical studies and clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approval for its programs, market acceptance of products, development by competitors of new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel, the ability to attract and retain qualified employees, reliance on third-party organizations, protection of proprietary technology, compliance with government regulations, and the ability to raise additional capital to fund operations. The Company’s programs currently under development, APG777, APG990, APG333 and APG808, will require significant additional research and development efforts, including extensive preclinical and clinical testing and regulatory approval prior to commercialization. These efforts require significant amounts of additional capital, adequate personnel and infrastructure, and extensive compliance reporting capabilities. Even if the Company’s development efforts are successful, it is uncertain when, if ever, the Company will realize revenue from product sales. The Company has primarily funded its operations with proceeds from the sales of preferred units and common stock and has not generated any revenue since inception.
As a result, the Company will need substantial additional funding to support its continued operations and growth strategy. Until such a time as the Company can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, the Company expects to finance its operations through the sale of equity, debt financings or other capital sources, including collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions. The Company may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements on favorable terms, or at all. If the Company fails to raise capital or enter into such agreements as, and when, needed, the Company may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and commercialization of one or more of its programs.
Company Liquidity
The Company has evaluated whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the accompanying consolidated financial statements are issued. The Company had an accumulated deficit of 
$
305.9
 million as of December 31, 2024. Further, the Company incurred a net loss of 
$
182.1
 million and experienced negative cash flows from operations of 
$
171.2
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. Based on the Company’s current operating plan, it estimates that its existing cash and cash equivalents of 
$
141.8
 million, marketable securities of 
$
378.9
 million and long-term marketable securities of 
$
210.4
 million as of December 31, 2024, will be sufficient to enable the Company to fund its operating expenses and capital requirements through at least the next 12 months from the issuance of these consolidated financial statements.

projects 
will be successful, that products developed will obtain necessary regulatory approval, or that any approved product will be commercially viable. In addition, the Company operates in an environment of rapid technological change and is largely dependent on the services of its employees and consultants. If the Company fails to become profitable or is unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then it may be unable to continue its operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce its operations.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements prior to the Reorganization include the accounts of Apogee Therapeutics, LLC and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Apogee Biologics, Inc. The consolidated financial statements subsequent to the Reorganization include the accounts of Apogee Therapeutics, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Apogee Therapeutics Securities Corporation, formed as a Massachusetts security corporation in September 2024, and Apogee Biologics, Inc. Until December 31, 2024, when Apogee Biologics, Inc. merged with and into Apogee Therapeutics, Inc. with Apogee Therapeutics, Inc. surviving the merger.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Any reference in these notes to applicable guidance is meant to refer to the authoritative GAAP as found in the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) and Accounting Standards Updates of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). In the Company’s management opinion, the information furnished in these consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, all of which are of a normal and recurring nature, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and results of operations for the reported periods. The Company considers events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued to provide additional evidence relative to certain estimates or to identify matters that require additional disclosure.
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apogee Therapeutics, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. Management considers many factors in selecting appropriate financial accounting policies and controls, and in developing the estimates and assumptions that are used in the preparation of these financial statements. Management must apply significant judgment in this process. In addition, other factors may affect estimates, including: expected business and operational changes, sensitivity and volatility associated with the assumptions used in developing estimates, and whether historical trends are expected to be representative of future trends. The estimation process often may yield a range of potentially reasonable estimates of the ultimate future outcomes and management must select an amount that falls within that range of reasonable estimates. Significant estimates relied upon in preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements include, among others: research and development expenses and related prepaid or accrued costs, the valuation of equity-based compensation awards and related expense.
Segments
The Company has 
one
 operating segment and 
one
 reporting unit. The Company’s chief operating decision maker, its Chief Executive Officer, manages the Company’s operations on a consolidated basis for the purposes of assessing performance and allocating resources. All of the Company’s assets are located in the United States.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company is required to disclose information on all assets and liabilities reported at fair value that enables an assessment of the inputs used in determining the reported fair values. FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC 820”), establishes a hierarchy of inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The fair value hierarchy applies only to the valuation inputs used in determining the reported fair value of the investments and is not a measure of the investment credit quality. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:
Level 1—
Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.
Level 2—
Valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3—
Valuations that require inputs that reflect the Company’s own assumptions that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.
To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. A financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
Items measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2024
 include cash equivalents and marketable securities (Notes 3 and 4). The carrying amounts reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets for prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature.
Property and Equipment, net
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives of the assets:

ESTIMATED
USEFUL LIFE

Laboratory equipment

5
 years

Leasehold improvements

Shorter of the lease term or useful life

Upon disposal, retirement or sale, the cost of assets disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in the results of operations. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance that do not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets are charged to expense as incurred.
Preferred Units
The Company has classified the preferred units as temporary equity because the units could become effectively settled for cash or other assets due to certain contingent event clauses that are outside of the Company’s control. The preferred units are not currently settleable, but are entitled to a distribution of available proceeds upon a change of control or a sale event which is a bona fide, negotiated transaction in which the Company has determined to affect a change of control. Because the occurrence of a change of control and a sale event is not currently probable, the carrying values of the preferred units are not being accreted to their redemption values. Subsequent adjustments to the carrying values of the preferred units would be made only when the change of control or sale event becomes probable. All outstanding preferred units were exchanged for shares of common stock (or non-voting common stock in lieu therefor) in connection with the IPO in July 2023.

Research and Development Expense
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses consist of costs incurred in performing research and development activities, including salaries and bonuses, overhead costs, contract services and other related costs. The value of goods and services received from contract research organizations and contract manufacturing organizations in the reporting period are estimated based on the level of services performed, and progress in the period in cases when the Company has not received an invoice from the supplier. In circumstances where amounts have been paid in excess of costs incurred, the Company records a prepaid expense. When billing terms under these contracts do not coincide with the timing of when the work is performed, the Company is required to make estimates of outstanding obligations to those third parties as of period end. Any accrual estimates are based on a number of factors, including the Company’s knowledge of the progress towards completion of the specific tasks to be performed, invoicing to date under the contracts, communication from the vendors of any actual costs incurred during the period that have not yet been invoiced and the costs included in the contracts. Significant judgments and estimates may be made in determining the accrued balances at the end of any reporting period. Actual results could differ from the estimates made by the Company.

Income Taxes
Income taxes are recorded in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”), which provides for deferred taxes using an asset and liability approach. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.
Valuation allowances are provided if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company makes estimates and judgments about future taxable income based on assumptions that are consistent with the Company’s plans and estimates. Should the actual amounts differ from these estimates, the amount of the Company’s valuation allowance could be materially impacted. Changes in these estimates may result in significant increases or decreases to the tax provision in a period in which such estimates are changed, which in turn would affect net income or loss.
The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740. When uncertain tax positions exist, the Company recognizes the tax benefit to the extent that the position is more likely than not to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position as well as consideration of the available facts and circumstances. The Company records interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions, if applicable, as a component of income tax expense.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original final maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include cash held in banks and amounts held in interest-bearing money market funds, U.S. treasury securities, U.S. Government agency securities, and commercial paper.

Marketable Securities
The Company’s investments are comprised of U.S. government agency securities, U.S. treasury securities, commercial paper and corporate debt securities. Investments are classified at the time of purchase, based on management’s intent, as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale, or trading. All of the Company’s marketable security investments are classified as available-for-sale securities and are reported at fair market value using quoted prices in active markets for similar securities. The cost of securities sold is determined on a specific identification basis, and realized gains and losses are included as a component of other income within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Unrealized gains and losses are included within the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.

Table of Contents

The Company assesses its available-for-sale securities under the available-for-sale security impairment model in ASU 2016-13, 
Financial Instruments-Credit Losses
 (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Statements as of each reporting date in order to determine if a portion of any decline in fair value below carrying value is the result of a credit loss for its available-for-sale securities. The Company records credit losses for its available-for-sale securities in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as credit loss expense, which is limited to the difference between the fair value and the amortized cost of the security. To date, the Company has not recorded any credit losses on its available-for-sale securities. Declines in fair value below carrying value attributable to non-credit related factors are recorded as accumulated other comprehensive loss, which is a separate component of stockholders’ equity.
The Company classifies its available-for-sale securities that mature within one year from the balance sheet date as current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Available-for-sale securities that mature more than one year from the balance sheet date are classified as non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
Leases
The Company determines the initial classification and measurement of its right-of-use assets and lease liabilities at the lease commencement date and thereafter if modified. The lease term includes any renewal options and termination options that the Company is reasonably assured to exercise. The present value of lease payments is determined by using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate is readily determinable; otherwise, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate. The incremental borrowing rate is determined by using the rate of interest that the Company would pay to borrow on a collateralized basis an amount equal to the lease payments for a similar term and in a similar economic environment.
Fixed lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis, unless the right-of-use assets have been impaired, over the reasonably assured lease term based on the total lease payments and is included in operating expenses in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

Equity-Based Compensation
Prior to the Reorganization, the Company issued equity-based awards to employees, managers, executives, non-employees and service providers in the form of common units and incentive units. Subsequent to the Reorganization, the Company issued equity-based awards to employees, managers, executives, non-employees and service providers in the form of restricted common stock, restricted stock units, and stock options. The Company accounts for equity-based compensation awards in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, 
Compensation-Stock Compensation
 (“ASC 718”).
Due to the absence of an active market for the Company’s common units or incentive units prior to the completion of the IPO, the Company utilized methodologies in accordance with the framework of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Accounting and Valuation Guide, 
Valuation of Privately-Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation
, to estimate the fair value of its common units and incentive units. The estimated fair value of the common units and incentive units was determined at each grant date based upon a variety of factors, including the illiquid nature of the common units, arm’s-length sales of the Company’s equity units (including preferred units), the effect of the rights and preferences of the preferred unit unitholders, and the prospects of a liquidity event. Among other factors are the Company’s financial position and historical financial performance, the status of technological developments within the Company’s research, the composition and ability of the current research and management team, an evaluation or benchmark of the Company’s competition, and the current business climate in the marketplace. Significant changes to the key assumptions underlying the factors used could have resulted in different fair values of the common units and incentive units at each valuation date.
Subsequent to the completion of the IPO, the fair value of the Company’s common stock underlying its equity awards is based on the quoted market price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date.

135

Table of Contents

The Company estimates the fair value of its stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which uses as inputs the fair value of the Company’s common stock, and certain management estimates, including the expected stock price volatility, the expected term of the award, the risk-free rate, and expected dividends. Expected volatility is calculated based on reported volatility data for a representative group of publicly traded companies for which historical information is available. The Company selects companies with comparable characteristics with historical share price information that approximates the expected term of the equity-based awards. The Company computes the historical volatility data using the daily closing prices for the selected companies’ shares during the equivalent period that approximates the calculated expected term of the stock options. The Company will continue to apply this method until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of its stock price becomes available. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant commensurate with the expected term assumption. The Company uses the simplified method, under which the expected term is presumed to be the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term. The Company utilizes this method due to lack of historical exercise data. The expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero as the Company has no current plans to pay any dividends on common stock. The fair value of the restricted stock units are based on the Company’s stock price on the date of the grant.
The Company generally issues equity awards that are subject to either service-based vesting conditions and in limited instances, service-based and performance-based vesting conditions. Compensation expense for awards issued to grantees with service-based vesting conditions are recognized on a straight-line basis based on the grant date fair value over the associated requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term. Compensation expense for awards to grantees with service-based and performance-based vesting conditions are recognized based on the grant-date fair value over the requisite service period using the accelerated attribution method to the extent achievement of the performance condition is probable. As of each reporting date, the Company estimates the probability that specified performance criteria will be met and does not recognize compensation expense until it is probable that the performance-based vesting condition will be achieved.
The Company evaluates whether an equity award should be classified and accounted for as a liability award or equity award for all equity-based compensation awards granted. As of December 31, 2024
, all of the Company’s equity-based awards were equity classified. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur. The Company classifies equity-based compensation expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss in the same manner in which the award recipient’s salary and related costs are classified or in which the award recipient’s service payments are classified, as applicable.
Concentrations of Credit Risk and Significant Suppliers
Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to credit risk primarily consist of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The Company’s investment portfolio is comprised of money market funds, debt securities issued by U.S. government and corporate debt securities. The Company maintains its deposits with accredited financial institutions and, consequently, the Company does not believe it is subject to unusual credit risk beyond the normal credit risk associated with commercial banking relationships. Bank accounts in the United States are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) up to $250,000. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, predominantly all of the Company’s primary operating accounts significantly exceeded the FDIC limits.
The Company is dependent on third-party organizations to research, develop, manufacture and process its product candidates for its development programs. In particular, the Company currently relies on a limited number of third-party contract manufacturers to produce and process its programs, APG777, APG990, APG333 and APG808, for preclinical and clinical activities. The Company expects to continue to be dependent on a small number of manufacturers to supply it with its requirements for all products. The Company’s research and development programs could be adversely affected by a significant interruption in the supply of the necessary materials.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023
, the Company had 
no
 off-balance sheet risks such as foreign exchange contracts, option contracts or other foreign hedging arrangements.

Comprehensive Loss
Comprehensive loss includes net loss as well as other changes in stockholders' equity that result from transactions and events other than those with stockholders. The Company’s unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities represent the only component of other comprehensive loss that are excluded from the reported net loss and that are presented in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.
Net Loss Per Share
The Company follows the two-class method when computing net loss per share. Prior to the Reorganization, the Company issued units that met the definition of participating securities, including the Company’s Series A Preferred Units, the Series B Preferred Units, and vested incentive units (each a participating security), and subsequent to the Reorganization, the Company has two classes of common stock outstanding comprised of voting and non-voting shares. The rights of the holders of voting and non-voting shares are identical, except with respect to voting and conversion. Each share of non-voting stock may be converted into one share of voting stock at any time at the option of the stockholder, subject to certain beneficial ownership limitations. The two-class method determines net loss per unit and net loss per share for each class of common and participating securities according to dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The two-class method requires income for the period to be allocated between common and participating securities based upon their respective rights to share in the income as if all income for the period had been distributed. Prior to the Reorganization, during periods of loss, there was no allocation required under the two-class method since the participating securities did not have a contractual obligation to fund the losses of the Company. Subsequent to the Reorganization, net loss per share for each class of common stock issued is the same as they are entitled to the same liquidation and dividend rights.
Prior to the Reorganization, the Company calculated basic net loss per common share by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common units outstanding for the period. Subsequent to the Reorganization, the Company calculates basic net loss per common share by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. The Company has generated a net loss in the periods presented so the basic and diluted net loss per unit and net loss per share are the same as the inclusion of the potentially dilutive securities would be anti-dilutive.
For periods presented that include the Reorganization, the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding include the weighted average number of common units outstanding prior to the Reorganization.

Other Significant Agreements 
Paragon Option and License Agreements
For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized 
$
19.2
 million of research and development expense in connection with services provided by Paragon under the Option and License Agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized 
$
26.3
 million of research and development expense in connection with services provided by Paragon under the Option and License Agreements.
Option Agreements
In February 2022, the Company entered into an antibody discovery and option agreement with Paragon, which was subsequently amended in November 2022 (as amended, the “2022 Option Agreement”). Under the terms of the 2022 Option Agreement, Paragon identifies, evaluates and develops antibodies directed against certain mutually agreed therapeutic targets of interest to the Company. The 2022 Option Agreement initially included 
two
 selected targets, IL-13 and IL-4Rα, and was subsequently amended in November 2022 to include an additional selected target, OX40L. Under the 2022 Option Agreement, the Company has the exclusive option to, on a research program-by-research program basis, be granted an exclusive, worldwide license to all of Paragon’s right, title and interest in and to the intellectual property resulting from the applicable research program to develop, manufacture and commercialize the antibodies and products directed to the selected targets (each, an Option). From time to time, the Company can choose to add additional targets to the collaboration by mutual agreement with Paragon.
Pursuant to the terms of the 2022 Option Agreement, the parties initiated certain research programs that generally focused on a particular target (each, a 
“Research Program”). Each Research Program is aimed at discovering, generating, identifying and/or characterizing antibodies directed to the respective target. For each Research Program, the parties established a research plan that sets forth the activities that will be conducted, and the associated research budget (each, a “Research Plan”). Upon execution of the 2022 Option Agreement, the Company agreed with Paragon on an initial Research Plan that outlined the services that will be performed commencing at inception of the arrangement related to IL-13 and IL-4Rα. The Research Plan for OX40L was agreed to prior to December 31, 2022. The Company's exclusive option with respect to any future Research Program is exercisable at the Company's sole discretion at any time during the period beginning on the initiation of activities under the associated Research Program and ending a specified number of days following the delivery of the data package from Paragon related to the results of the Research Plan activities (the “Option Period”). There is 
no

Unless terminated earlier, the 2022 Option Agreement shall continue in force on a Research Program-by-Research Program basis until the earlier of: (i) the end of the Option Period for such Research Program, as applicable, if such Option is not exercised by the Company; and (ii) the effective date of the license agreement for such Research Program if the Company exercises its Option with respect to such Research Program (the “2022 Term”). Upon the expiration of the 2022 Term for all then-existing Research Programs, under the 2022 Option Agreement, the 2022 Option Agreement will automatically expire in its entirety. The Company may terminate the 2022 Option Agreement or any Research Program at any time for any or no reason upon

the 
Company must pay certain unpaid fees due to Paragon upon such termination, as well as any non-cancellable obligations reasonably incurred by Paragon in connection with its activities under any terminated Research Program. Each party has the right to terminate the 2022 Option Agreement or any Research Program upon (i)
 30 days
’ prior written notice of the other party’s material breach that remains uncured for the 
30-day
 period and (ii) the other party’s bankruptcy.
In consideration for the exclusive options granted under the 2022 Option Agreement, the Company paid an upfront cash amount of $
1.3
 million and issued 
1,250,000
 common units to Paragon. Paragon was also entitled to up to an additional 
3,750,000
 of common units in exchange for the rights granted under the 2022 Option Agreement, which were issued in connection with the closings of the additional tranches of the Series A Preferred Unit financing (see Note 10). Under the 2022 Option Agreement, on a Research Program-by-Research Program basis following the finalization of the Research Plan for each respective Research Program, the Company is required to pay Paragon a nonrefundable fee in cash of $
0.5
 million. The Company is also obligated to compensate Paragon on a quarterly basis for its services performed under each Research Program based on the actual costs incurred.
In November 2023, the Company entered into an additional antibody discovery and option agreement with Paragon (the “2023 Option Agreement” and together with the 2022 Option Agreement, collectively, the “Option Agreements”). Under the terms of the 2023 Option Agreement, Paragon identifies, evaluates and develops antibodies directed against certain mutually agreed therapeutic targets of interest to the Company. The 2023 Option Agreement initially includes one target, TSLP. Under the 2023 Option Agreement, the Company has the exclusive option to, on a research program-by-research program basis, be granted an exclusive, worldwide license to all of Paragon’s right, title and interest in and to the intellectual property resulting from the applicable research program to develop, manufacture and commercialize the antibodies and products directed to the selected targets. From time to time, the Company can choose to add additional targets to the collaboration by mutual agreement with Paragon.
Pursuant to the terms of the 2023 Option Agreement, the parties may initiate Research Programs. Each Research Program will be aimed at discovering, generating, identifying and/or characterizing antibodies directed to the respective target. For each Research Program, the parties must establish a Research Plan. In January 2024, the Company and Paragon agreed on an initial Research Plan that outlines the services that will be performed commencing at inception of the arrangement related to TSLP. The Company's exclusive option with respect to each Research Program is exercisable at the Company's sole discretion at any time during the period beginning on the initiation of activities under the associated Research Program and ending a specified number of days following the delivery of the data package from Paragon related to the results of the Research Plan activities. There is 
no
 payment due upon exercise of an Option pursuant to the 2023 Option Agreement.
Under the 2023 Option Agreement, on a Research Program-by-Research Program basis following the finalization of the Research Plan for each respective Research Program, the Company is required to pay Paragon a nonrefundable fee in cash of $
2.0
 million. The Company is also obligated to compensate Paragon on a quarterly basis for its services performed under each Research Program based on the actual costs incurred. The Company expenses the service fees as the associated costs are incurred when the underlying services are rendered. In January 2024, the Company finalized the Research Plan with Paragon related to the TSLP target. As such, the Company made a one-time non-refundable payment of $
2.0
 million to Paragon in the first quarter of 2024.
Unless terminated earlier, the Option Agreements shall continue in force on a Research Program-by-Research Program basis until the earlier of: (i) the end of the Option Period for such Research Program, as applicable, if such Option is not exercised by the Company; and (ii) the effective date of the license agreement for such Research Program if the Company exercises its Option with respect to such Research Program (the “Term”). Upon the expiration of the Term for all then-existing Research Programs, the applicable Option Agreement will automatically expire in its entirety. The Company may terminate either Option Agreement or any Research Program at any time for any or no reason upon 
30 days
’ prior written notice to Paragon, provided that the Company must pay certain unpaid fees due to Paragon upon such termination, as well as any non-cancellable obligations reasonably incurred by Paragon in connection with its activities under any terminated Research Program. Each party has the right to terminate either Option Agreement or any Research Program upon (i) 
30 days
’ prior written notice of the other party’s material breach that remains uncured for the

License Agreements
In November 2022, the Company exercised its option available under the 2022 Option Agreement with respect to the IL-13 Research Program. Upon such exercise, the parties entered into an associated license agreement (the “IL-13 License Agreement”). In April 2023, the Company exercised its option available under the 2022 Option Agreement with respect to the IL- 4Rα Research Program and the OX40L Research Program. Upon such exercise, the parties entered into associated license agreements (the “IL-4Rα License Agreement” and the “OX40L License Agreement,” respectively). In August 2024, the Company exercised its option available under the 2023 Option Agreement with respect to the TSLP Research Program and entered into the associated license agreement (the “TSLP License Agreement” and collectively with the IL-13 License Agreement, the IL-4Rα License Agreement and the OX40L License Agreement, the “License Agreements”). Under the terms of the License Agreements, Paragon granted to the Company an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable right and license with respect to certain information, patent rights and sequence information related to antibodies directed at the respective target to use, make, sell, import, export and otherwise exploit the antibodies directed at the respective target. Pursuant to the License Agreements, the Company granted to Paragon a similar license (except that such license the Company granted to Paragon is non-exclusive) to the respective licenses with respect to multispecific antibodies that are directed at the respective targets and one or more other antibodies. The Company was also granted a right of first negotiation with Paragon concerning the development, license and grant of rights to certain multispecific antibodies associated with each respective license. The Company is solely responsible for the continued development, manufacture and commercialization of products at its own cost and expense for each licensed target.
Under the IL-13 License Agreement, the IL-4Rα License Agreement and the OX40L License Agreement, the Company is obligated to pay Paragon up to $
3.0
 million upon the achievement of specific development and clinical milestones for the first product under each of the License Agreements that achieves such specified milestones, including a payment of $
1.0
 million upon the nomination of a development candidate and $
2.0
 million upon the first dosing of a human patient in a Phase 1 trial. Under the TSLP License Agreement, the Company is obligated to pay Paragon up to $
28.0
 million upon the achievement of specific development and clinical milestones for the first product, including a payment of $
3.0
 million upon the nomination of a development candidate and $
5.0
 million upon the first dosing of a human patient in a Phase 1 trial.
Upon execution of the IL‑13 License Agreement, the Company paid Paragon a $
1.0
 million fee for the nomination of a development candidate. In August 2023, the Company announced the dosing of its first participant in the Phase 1 trial of APG777 and made a milestone payment of $
2.0
 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. In November 2023, the Company finalized the nomination of a development candidate under the IL‑4Rα License Agreement and made a milestone payment of $
1.0
 million to Paragon in the fourth quarter of 2023. In March 2024, the Company announced the dosing of its first participant in a Phase 1 trial of APG808 and made a milestone payment of $
2.0
 million to Paragon in the first quarter of 2024. In May 2024, the Company finalized the nomination of a development candidate under the OX40L License Agreement and made a milestone payment of $
1.0
 million to Paragon in the second quarter of 2024. In August 2024, the Company announced the dosing of its first participant in the Phase 1 trial of APG990 and made a milestone payment of $
2.0
 million to Paragon in the third quarter of 2024. In October 2024, the Company finalized the nomination of a development candidate under the TSLP License Agreement and made a milestone payment of $
3.0
 million to Paragon in the fourth quarter of 2024. In December 2024, the Company announced the dosing of its first participant in the Phase 1 trial of APG333 and made a milestone payment of $
5.0
 million in the fourth quarter of 2024.
The Company is also obligated to pay royalties to Paragon equal to a low-single digit percentage of net sales of any products under each of the respective License Agreements, and Paragon has a similar obligation to pay royalties to the Company with respect to each of the multispecific licenses. Royalties are due on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis beginning upon the first commercial sale of each product and ending on the later of (i) 
12
 years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country and (ii) expiration of the last valid claim of a patent covering such product in such country (the “Royalty Term”).
Unless earlier terminated, the License Agreements remain in effect until the expiration of the last-to-expire Royalty Term for any and all Products associated with the respective license. The Company may terminate the agreement in its entirety or on a country-by-country or product-by-product at any time for any or no reason upon 
60 days
’ 
advance written notice to Paragon, and either party may terminate for (i) the other party’s material breach that

142

Table of Contents

remains 
uncured for 
90 days
 (or 
30 days
 with respect to any failure to make payments) following notice of such breach and (ii) the other party’s bankruptcy. Upon any termination prior to the expiration of a License Agreement, all licenses and rights granted pursuant to such License Agreement will automatically terminate and revert to the granting party and all other rights and obligations of the parties will terminate.
The Company concluded that each of the License Agreements constitutes an asset acquisition of in-process research and development assets with no alternative future use. Each of the arrangements did not qualify as a business combination because substantially all of the fair value of the assets acquired was concentrated in the license which comprises a single identifiable asset. Therefore, the aggregate acquisition cost for each license was recognized as research and development expense.

Biologics Master Services Agreement — WuXi Biologics (Hong Kong) Limited
In June 2022, Paragon and WuXi Biologics (Hong Kong) Limited (“WuXi Biologics”) entered into a biologics master services agreement (the “WuXi Biologics MSA”), which was subsequently novated to the Company by Paragon in the second quarter of 2023. The WuXi Biologics MSA governs all development activities and GMP manufacturing and testing for our APG777, APG990, APG333 and APG808 programs, as well as potential future programs, on a work order basis. Under the WuXi Biologics MSA, the Company is obligated to pay WuXi Biologics a service fee and all non-cancellable obligations in the amount specified in each work order associated with the agreement for the provision of services.
The WuXi Biologics MSA terminates on the later of (i) June 20, 2027 or (ii) the completion of services under all work orders executed by the parties prior to June 20, 2027, unless terminated earlier. The term of each work order terminates upon completion of the services under such work order, unless terminated earlier. The Company can terminate the WuXi Biologics MSA or any work order at any time upon 30 days’ prior written notice and immediately upon written notice if WuXi Biologics fails to obtain or maintain required material governmental licenses or approvals. Either party may terminate a work order (i) at any time upon 
six months
’ prior notice with reasonable cause, provided however that if WuXi Biologics terminates a work order in such manner, no termination or cancellation fees shall be paid by the Company and (ii) immediately for cause upon (a) the other party’s material breach that remains uncured for 
30 days
 after notice of such breach, (b) the other party’s bankruptcy or (c) a force majeure event that prevents performance for a period of at least 
90 days
.
For the year ended December 31, 2024
, the Company recognized $
31.8
 million of research and development expense in connection with the WuXi Biologics MSA, compared to $
20.2
 million for the 
year ended December 31, 2023.
Cell Line License Agreement — WuXi Biologics (Hong Kong) Limited
In June 2022, Paragon and WuXi Biologics entered into a cell line license agreement (the “Cell Line License Agreement”), which was subsequently novated to the Company by Paragon in the second quarter of 2023. Under the Cell Line License Agreement, the Company received a non-exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license to certain of WuXi Biologics’ know-how, cell line, biological materials (the “WuXi Biologics Licensed Technology”) and media and feeds to make, have made, use, sell and import certain therapeutic products produced through the use of the cell line licensed by WuXi Biologics under the Cell Line License Agreement (the WuXi Biologics Licensed Products). Specifically, the WuXi Biologics Licensed Technology is used to manufacture a component of the Company’s APG777, APG990, APG333 and APG808 programs.
In consideration for the license, the Company paid WuXi Biologics a non-refundable license fee of $
150,000
. Additionally, if the Company manufactures all of its commercial supplies of bulk drug product with a manufacturer other than WuXi Biologics or its affiliates, the Company is required to make royalty payments to WuXi Biologics in an amount equal to a fraction of a single digit percentage of global net sales of WuXi Biologics Licensed Products manufactured by a third-party manufacturer (the “Royalty”). If the Company manufactures part of its commercial supplies of the WuXi Biologics Licensed Products with WuXi Biologics or its affiliates, then the Royalty will be reduced accordingly on a pro rata basis.

Commitments and Contingencies
Other Contracts
Currently, all of the Company’s preclinical and clinical drug manufacturing, storage, distribution or quality testing are outsourced to third-party manufacturers. As development programs progress and new process efficiencies are built, the Company expects to continually evaluate this strategy with the objective of satisfying demand for registration trials and, if approved, the manufacture, sale and distribution of commercial products. Under such agreements, the Company is contractually obligated to make certain payments to vendors upon early termination, primarily to reimburse them for their unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation as well as any amounts owed by the Company prior to early termination. The actual amounts the Company could pay in the future to the vendors under such agreements may differ from the purchase order amounts due to cancellation provisions.
Indemnification Agreements
The Company enters into standard indemnification agreements and/or indemnification sections in other agreements in the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to the agreements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless, and agrees to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally the Company’s business partners. The term of these indemnification agreements is generally perpetual any time after execution of the agreement. There is no limit to the maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has not incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements. The Company was not aware of any claims under these indemnification arrangements as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.
Legal Proceedings
The Company is not currently party to any material legal proceedings. At each reporting date, the Company evaluates whether or not a potential loss amount or a potential range of loss is probable and reasonably estimable under the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 450, 
Contingencies (“
ASC 450
”)
. The Company expenses as incurred the costs related to its legal proceedings.

Preferred Shares
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had authorized, issued and outstanding an aggregate of 
65,089,212
 preferred units, of which 
20,000,000
 units had been designated as Series A Preferred Units and 
45,089,212
 units had been designated as Series B Preferred Units. All outstanding preferred units were exchanged for 
24,987,750
 shares of common stock (or non-voting common stock in lieu thereof) in connection with the IPO in July 2023. As of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not have any outstanding preferred units.
Series A Preferred Units
On February 24, 2022, the Company executed the Series A Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement (the “Series A Agreement”) to issue and sell up to 
20,000,000
 Series A Preferred Units at a purchase price of $
1.00
 per unit. In the initial closing on February 24, 2022, the Company issued 
5,000,000
 Series A Preferred Units at a purchase price of $
1.00
, resulting in gross cash proceeds to the Company of $
5.0
 million, and incurred $
0.2
 million of 
issuance costs.

Table of Contents

The 
Series A Agreement provided for three tranche option closings following the initial closing (the “Tranche Options”), which Tranche Option closings were subject to approval of the Board of Managers of Apogee Therapeutics, LLC (the “Board of Managers”), which was controlled by the holders of the Series A Preferred Units. The Board of Managers approved all such subsequent closings resulting in investors purchasing 
5,000,000
 Series A Preferred Units in each of the three subsequent Tranche Option closings throughout 2022. As a result, the Company received an aggregate of $
20.0
 million in gross proceeds associated with the Series A Agreement.
The Company assessed the Tranche Options and concluded that they met the definition of a freestanding financial instrument, as the Tranche Options were legally detachable and separately exercisable from the Series A Preferred Units. Therefore, the Company allocated the proceeds between the Tranche Options and the Series A Preferred Units sold at the initial closing. As the Series A Preferred Units are contingently redeemable upon an event that is not completely within the control of the Company, the Tranche Options are classified as an asset or liability and are initially recorded at fair value. The Tranche Options are measured at fair value at each reporting period, through the settlement of the instrument. Since the Tranche Options are subject to fair value accounting, the Company allocated $
1.1
 million of the initial proceeds to the Tranche Options based on the fair value at the date of issuance with the remaining proceeds beings allocated to the Series A Preferred Units. Upon the Tranche Option closings in August and October 2022, the respective Tranche Option value was remeasured at fair value and then reclassified to Series A Preferred Units upon settlement.
Series B Preferred Units
On November 15, 2022, the Company executed the Series B Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement (the “Series B Agreement”) to issue and sell 
45,089,212
 Series B Preferred Units in a single closing at a purchase price of $
3.30456
 per unit, resulting in gross cash proceeds to the Company of $
149.0
 million. The Company incurred $
0.5
 million of issuance costs in connection with the issuance of the Series B Preferred Units.
Embedded Securities Evaluation
The Company assessed the Series A Preferred Units and the Series B Preferred Units for any features that may require separate accounting under FASB ASC Topic 815‑ 
Derivatives and Hedging 
(“ASC 815”). The Company concluded that none of the features required separate accounting as a derivative.

Equity-Based Compensation
Incentive Units
Prior to the Reorganization, the Company periodically granted incentive units to employees, managers and executives, as well as to consultants and service providers of the Company. The incentive units represent a separate substantive class of members’ equity with defined rights. The incentive units represent profits interest in the increase in the value of the entity over a threshold value, or strike price, as determined at the time of grant. The strike price is established for tax compliance purposes related to Internal Revenue Service Revenue Procedure 93-27 and 2001-43 where the Company allocates equity value to separate classes of equity in a hypothetical liquidation transaction as of the date of grant. Each incentive unit issued includes a strike price determined by the Board of Managers. The strike price is based on an estimate of the amount a common unit would receive on the date of issuance of such incentive units in a hypothetical liquidation of the Company in which the Company sold its assets for their fair market value, satisfied its liabilities, and distributed the net proceeds to the holders of units in liquidation of the Company.
The Company accounts for equity-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718. In accordance with ASC 718, compensation cost is measured at estimated fair value and is included as compensation expense over the vesting period during which service is provided in exchange for the award. The service-based incentive unit grants generally vest over a 
four-year
 service period, with the first 
25
% vesting on the 
12-month
 anniversary of the vesting start date and the remaining vesting in equal monthly installments 
over
 the following 
36 months
. The service-based and performance-based incentive unit grant, which the Company has one such award, vests in the same manner as the service-based award upon the achievement of the performance condition. The Company had one incentive unit grant which vested immediately upon issuance. The holders of vested incentive units are entitled to distributions and are not required to purchase or “exercise” their incentive units in order to receive such distributions. However, distributions to incentive unit holders began only after the cumulative amount distributed to common unit holders exceeds the strike price with respect to such incentive unit.
The Company determined that incentive units issued to employees, managers, executives, non-employees and service providers are equity-based service payments and, as such, the Company measures and recognizes the related compensation expense in a manner consistent with its accounting policy for equity-based awards.

146

Table of Contents

The fair value of each incentive unit grant was estimated on the grant date using either an option pricing method (“OPM”), or a hybrid method, both of which used market approaches to estimate the Company’s enterprise value. The OPM treats common units, incentive units and preferred units as call options on the total equity value of a company, with exercise prices based on the value thresholds at which the allocation among the various holders of a company’s securities changes. Under this method, the incentive units have value only if the funds available for distribution to unitholders exceed the value of the preferred and common unit distribution preferences and the strike price with respect to such incentive unit at the time of the liquidity event. The hybrid method is a probability-weighted expected return method (“PWERM”), where the equity value is allocated in one or more of the scenarios using an OPM. The PWERM is a scenario-based methodology that estimates the fair value of each unit based upon an analysis of future values, assuming various outcomes. The incentive unit value is based on the probability-weighted value across the scenarios, considering the OPM to estimate the value within each scenario given the rights of each class of unit. A discount for lack of marketability of the incentive unit is then applied to arrive at an indication of fair value for the incentive unit.
The following assumptions were used in determining the fair value of incentive units granted during the period:

Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units
In July 2023, in connection with the IPO, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) and stockholders approved the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2023 Plan”), which became effective on the date of the effectiveness of the registration statement for the IPO. The 2023 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, awards of restricted stock, restricted stock units and other stock-based awards. As of December 31, 2024
, the number of shares of common stock available for future grants under the 2023 Plan is equal to 
3,720,964
 shares of common stock. The number of shares available for grant and issuance under the 2023 Plan will be automatically increased on January 1 of each year by a number of shares equal to up to 
5
% of the outstanding shares of common stock on such date.

2023 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In July 2023, the Board adopted and the Company’s stockholders approved the 2023 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”), which became effective on July 13, 2023. The ESPP provides that eligible employees may contribute up to 
15
% of their eligible earnings toward the semi-annual purchase of the Company's common stock, subject to any plan limitations. The purchase period under the ESPP has a duration of 
six months
, and the purchase price with respect to each purchase period is equal to 
85
% of the lesser of (i) the fair market value of the Company's common stock at the commencement of the applicable six-month purchase period or (ii) the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the exercise date. As of 
December 31, 2024
, 
27,651
 shares have been issued under the ESPP and 
934,739
 shares remain available for issuance.

3.1

years.

In August 2023, the Board approved 
two
 option grants to the new Chairman of the Board, (1) to purchase 
50,000
 shares of the Company’s common stock under the 2023 Plan (“first option”), and (2) to purchase 
100,000
 shares of the Company’s common stock outside of the 2023 Plan (“second option”), in which the shares underlying both options will vest and become exercisable in equal monthly installments over a 
three-year
 period from August 2023. The second option was contingent upon approval of the shares underlying the award by the Company’s stockholders at the 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and failure to obtain stockholder approval would have resulted in the forfeiture of the award. Prior to receiving stockholder approval for the second option, neither a grant date nor a service inception date occurred, and 
no
 compensation cost was recognized for the award. In June 2024, the Company's stockholders approved the shares underlying the second option at the 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Therefore, a cumulative catch-up in equity-based compensation was recognized during the second quarter of 2024
.

Related Parties
Under the Option Agreements and the License Agreements, Paragon, a stockholder of the Company that was founded by a Series A Preferred Unit investor, received upfront consideration in the form of common units, is entitled to receive milestone and royalty payments upon specific conditions and receives payments from the Company for providing ongoing services under the agreements (see Note 8). As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 
$
0.1
 million and 
$
5.2
 million were due to Paragon, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company incurred research and development expenses with Paragon of 
$
19.2
 million. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company incurred research and development expenses with Paragon of

The Company has evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon its ability to realize the deferred tax assets. Management has considered the Company’s cumulative net losses and its lack of commercialization of any products or generation of any revenue from product sales since inception and has concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefits of the deferred tax assets. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance has been established against the net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2024. The change in the valuation allowance for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023
 was $
45.9
 million and $
23.5
 million, respectively. Management reevaluates the positive and negative evidence at each reporting period.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023
, the Company had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $
68.1
 million and $
23.6
 million, respectively, which have no expiration for federal tax purposes. As of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023
, the Company also had state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $
28.5
 million and $
6.5
 million, respectively, which will begin to expire in 2043.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023
, the Company had federal research and development credit carryforwards of approximately $
10.5
 million and $
2.7
 million, respectively, which will begin to expire in 2042. The Company also had California research and development credit carryforwards of approximately $
1.5
 million and $
0.7
 million as of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023
, respectively, which will not expire. Additionally, the Company had Massachusetts research and development credit carryforwards of approximately $
2.1
 million, which will begin to expire in 2043.
The Company will conduct a study of its research and development credit carryforwards, which may result in an adjustment to its unrecognized tax benefits. However, a full valuation allowance has been provided against the Company’s research and development credits and, if an adjustment is required, this adjustment would be offset by an adjustment to the valuation allowance. Thus, there would be no impact to the accompanying consolidated balance sheet or statement of operations if an adjustment were required.

The Company files tax returns as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates. Net operating losses are subject to review and possible adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service and state tax authorities. Net operating loss carryforwards may become subject to an annual limitation in the event of certain cumulative changes in the ownership interest of significant members over a three-year period in excess of 50%, as defined under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, respectively, as well as similar state provisions. This could limit the amount of tax attributes that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities. The amount of the annual limitation is determined based on the value of the company immediately prior to the ownership change. Subsequent ownership changes may further affect the limitation in future years. The Company has not yet finalized a study to determine if any such changes have occurred that could limit its ability to use the net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards.
All tax returns will remain open for examination by the federal and state taxing authorities for 
three
 and 
four years
, respectively, from the date of utilization of any net operating loss carryforwards or research and development credits.
It is the Company’s policy to include penalties and interest expense related to income taxes as a component of income tax expense, as necessary. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023
, the Company had 
no
 accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. The Company does not expect that its uncertain tax positions will materially change in the next twelve months.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) included a change in the treatment of research and development expenditures for tax purposes under Section 174. Effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2021
, specified R&D expenditures must undergo a 5-year amortization period for domestic spend and a 15-year amortization period for foreign spend. Prior to the effective date (2021 tax year and prior), taxpayers were able to immediately expense R&D costs under Section 174(a) or had the option to capitalize and amortize R&D expenditures over a 5-year recovery period under Section 174(b). The Company has evaluated the current legislation at this time and prepared the provision by following the treatment of research and development expenditures for tax purposes under Section 174.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and our Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024. Based on the foregoing evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2024. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and our management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and our Principal Financial Officer, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

As of December 31, 2024, our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.

Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, and has issued an attestation report, which is included herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Apogee Therapeutics, Inc.

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited Apogee Therapeutics, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 framework (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Apogee Therapeutics, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2024 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated March 3, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

156

Table of Contents

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
