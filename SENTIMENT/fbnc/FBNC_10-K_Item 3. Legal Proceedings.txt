Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition
This MD&A is intended to assist readers in understanding our results of operations and changes in financial position for the past three years. It should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item 8 of this Report. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated in forward-looking statements as a result of various factors.
Overview and 2024 Highlights
The Company is a bank holding company headquartered in Southern Pines, North Carolina. We provide diversified financial services primarily though the Bank, our principal subsidiary, including commercial and consumer banking services, mortgage lending, SBA lending, accounts receivable financing, and investment advisory services.  As of December 31, 2024, the Bank had a 113 branch network in North Carolina and South Carolina and 1,371 full-time equivalent employees. We have grown organically as well as through strategic acquisitions as discussed previously in "Recent Developments and Acquisitions".
2024 Financial Highlights:
•
Return on average assets was 0.63% for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to 0.87% for the prior year.  Return on average common equity of 5.38% was reported for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to 8.05% for the prior year.  
•
Our total assets at December 31, 2024 were $12.1 billion, a 0.3% increase from a year earlier. 
•
Total loans outstanding contracted by $0.1 billion, or 0.7%, during the year. Loans totaled $8.1 billion at December 31, 2024.  
•
Credit quality continued to be strong with the NPA to total assets ratio at 0.39% as of December 31, 2024, as compared to 0.37% at December 31, 2023. Net charge offs as a percentage of average loans were 0.07% for 2024, as compared to 0.08% for the prior year. 
•
Capital remained strong with a total CET1 ratio of 14.35%, up from 13.20% for the prior year, and total risk-based capital ratio of 16.63% as of December 31, 2024, an increase from 15.54% for the prior year.  
•
We earned net income of $76.2 million, or $1.84 diluted EPS, during 2024 compared to net income of $104.1 million, or $2.53 diluted EPS, in 2023. As noted below, 2024 results were dampened by a $13 million provision related to potential exposures from Hurricane Helene and a $36.8 million securities loss transaction that took place during the fourth quarter of 2024. See the following for discussion of changes to net income:
•
Net interest income for 2024 decreased $14.6 million, or 4.2%, driven by increased interest expense offset by higher interest income.  The NIM on a tax-equivalent basis was 2.91% for 2024, a decrease of 15 basis points from the prior year.  Despite the growth in average earning assets, the market-driven increase in rates on liabilities in the first half of 2024 occurred at a more rapid pace than the increase in yields on assets which resulted in the reduction in NIM for 2024.
•
Total interest income increased $30.3 million in 2024 as compared to 2023, driven by higher interest income on loans of $22.3 million related to a combination of higher volumes of average balances and increased yields.  Interest income on other interest-earning assets, primarily overnight funds, increased $12.8 million, primarily the result of higher volumes. 
•
The 2024 increase in interest expense of $44.9 million was driven by higher market rates in late 2023 and the first half of 2024 which resulted in repricing of our deposits and a corresponding $57.2 million increase in interest expense, especially in money market accounts which accounted for $47.9 million of the increase.  Offsetting the increase in interest expense on deposits was a reduction in interest expense on borrowings, which fell $12.4 million, primarily a result of lower average balances of borrowings outstanding.
•
Provision for credit losses for 2024 of $16.4 million was down from $17.8 million in 2023 due primarily to the initial provision established for acquired non-PCD loans of $12.2 million in 2023,

Table of Contents
lower organic loan growth in 2024 and generally positive updated economic forecasts, which are a key driver in the Company's CECL model as discussed further in the "Provision for Loan Losses" section below, and a reduction in the level of unfunded commitments.  This was partially offset by the $13 million provision related to potential exposure from Hurricane Helene in 2024. 
•
Noninterest income declined $39.4 million in 2024, which resulted primarily from the $38.0 million securities loss, $36.8 million of which was related to a securities loss-earnback transaction that took place in the fourth quarter of 2024. Refer to "Noninterest Income" section below for further discussion.
•
Noninterest expense decreased $18.8 million in 2024, primarily related to the GrandSouth acquisition completed January 1, 2023, which resulted in merger and acquisition expense of $13.7 million in 2023. In 2024, the Company actively managed headcount and applied additional expense controls.  Refer to "Noninterest Expense" section below for further discussion.
•
Income tax expense was down $5.9 million from the prior year relative to lower pre-tax income. The 2024 effective tax rate of 22.3% was up from the prior year as the result of incremental state tax-related expenses recorded in 2024 relating to prior years.
Current Economic Conditions
Recent economic activity has shown resilience with generally positive domestic results, low unemployment and increased demand for goods and services.  While inflationary pressures continue, monetary policy actions taken by the Federal Reserve over the last three years have resulted in a lower inflation rate in 2024.  A mix of positive and negative economic indicators remained present at the end of 2024 and there continues to be some uncertainty in economic conditions, and as such, we could be subject to ongoing risks, which could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.
Our financial position and results of operations are susceptible, among other factors, to the ability of our loan customers to meet their loan obligations to us, the availability of our workforce, the availability of our vendors, and the volatility in the value of assets held by us or securing our loans. We have not realized significant negative impact on our loan portfolio or asset quality to date as a result of the current economic conditions. However, the economic pressures and uncertainties, increased consumer demand and recent volatility in both short-term and long-term  interest rates have resulted in, and may continue to result in, specific changes in consumer and business spending and borrowing habits, given the current and expected interest rate environment, which could make it difficult to grow assets and income.  
The extent to which the current economic conditions have a further impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as our regulatory capital and liquidity ratios, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including actions taken by governmental authorities in response to inflationary trends and recessionary risks.  
Critical Accounting Estimates
The accounting principles we follow and our methods of applying these principles conform with GAAP and with general practices followed by the banking industry.  Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions, or judgments and, as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. We have identified the determination of our ACL and related Allowance for Unfunded Commitments, as well as business combinations, related fair value measurements and goodwill determination to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments, estimates, and assumptions, and where changes in those judgments, estimates, and assumptions (based on new or additional information, changes in the economic climate and/or market interest rates, etc.) could have a significant effect on our financial statements. See the "Allowance for Credit Losses, Allowance for Unfunded Commitments, and Loan Loss Experience" discussion in the Financial Condition section of Management's Discussion and Analysis.
Our most significant accounting policies are presented in Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. These policies, along with the disclosures presented in the other notes to the consolidated financial statements and in this MD&A, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined.

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Allowance for Unfunded Commitments
While management uses the best information available to establish the ACL, future adjustments to the ACL and methodology may be necessary if economic or other conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the estimates.  We perform periodic and systematic detailed reviews of the loan portfolio to identify trends and to assess the overall collectability of the portfolio. We believe the accounting estimate related to the ACL is a “critical accounting estimate” as: (1) changes in it can materially affect the provision for loan losses and net income; (2) it requires management to predict borrowers’ likelihood or capacity to repay, including evaluation of inherently uncertain future economic conditions; (3) the value of underlying collateral must be estimated on collateral-dependent loans; (4) prepayment activity must be projected to estimate the life of loans that often are shorter than contractual terms; and (5) it requires estimation of a reasonable and supportable forecast period for credit losses.  Accordingly, this is a highly subjective process and requires significant judgment since it is difficult to evaluate current and future economic conditions in relation to an overall credit cycle and estimate the timing and extent of loss events that are expected to occur prior to end of a loan’s estimated life. 
Our ACL is assessed at each quarterly balance sheet date and adjustments are recorded in the provision for loan losses on the consolidated statements of income. There are many factors affecting the ACL, some of which are quantitative, while others require qualitative judgment. There are both internal factors (i.e., loan balances, historical loss rates, credit quality, the contractual lives of loans), external factors (i.e., economic conditions such as trends in housing prices, interest rates, GDP, inflation, and unemployment), and assumptions of probability of default and loss given default by loan category, that can impact the ACL estimate.  One of the most significant assumptions is the macroeconomic scenario forecasts that determine the economic variables utilized in the ACL model. Due to the inherent uncertainty in the macroeconomic forecasts, we evaluate a baseline scenario quarterly, as well as upside or downside macroeconomic scenarios to assess the most reasonable scenario based on review of the variable forecasts for each scenario, comparison to expectations, and sensitivity of variations in each scenario. 
The most significant variable in the economic forecasts is the national unemployment rate (which has remained relatively stable), and changes in unemployment forecasts can have significant impact to the estimated ACL.  Other economic variables include national GDP, the national commercial real estate pricing index and the national home price index.  We use the national unemployment rate in all of our models regardless of the loan portfolio type, and we use a second economic variable in each cohort model depending on the loan portfolio type. The ACL quantitative estimate is sensitive to changes in the economic variable forecasts during the twelve-month reasonable and supportable forecast period with a straight-line reversion over the next three years to long-term average loss factors.  There have been no changes to the reasonable and supportable period or reversion period in any year presented. 
Although management believes its process for determining the ACL adequately considers all the factors that could potentially result in credit losses, the process includes subjective elements and is susceptible to significant change. To the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates, additional provision for loan losses could be required that could adversely affect our earnings or financial position in future periods.
PCD loans represent assets that are acquired with evidence of more than insignificant credit quality deterioration since origination at the acquisition date. At acquisition, the allowance on PCD assets is booked directly to the ACL. Any subsequent changes in the ACL on PCD assets is recorded through the provision for loan losses on the consolidated statements of income. 
We believe that the ACL is adequate to absorb the expected life of loan credit losses on the portfolio of loans as of the balance sheet date. Actual losses incurred may differ materially from our estimates. For example, inflationary pressures and recessionary concerns leading to macroeconomic economic deterioration, higher unemployment and declines in real estate and other asset valuations could affect our loss experience and assumptions utilized in our model.
We estimate expected credit losses on unfunded commitments to extend credit over the contractual period in which we are exposed to credit risk on the underlying commitments, unless the obligation is unconditionally cancellable. The allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures, which is included in "Other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets, is adjusted for as an increase or decrease to the provision for unfunded commitments. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life. The methodology is based on a loss rate approach that starts with the probability of funding based on historical experience.  Similar to the methodology discussed above

related to the loans receivable portfolio, adjustments are made to the historical losses for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. 
Additional information on the loan portfolio and ACL can be found in the sections of this Item 7 titled “Nonperforming Assets” and “Allowance for Credit Losses and Loan Loss Experience” below.
Business Combinations and Goodwill
We believe that the accounting for business combinations, goodwill, and other intangible assets also involves a higher degree of judgment than most other significant accounting policies.  Pursuant to applicable accounting guidance, we recognize assets acquired, including identified intangible assets, and the liabilities assumed in acquisitions at their fair values as of the acquisition date, with the related transaction costs expensed in the period incurred. Specified items such as acquired operating lease assets and liabilities as lessee, employee benefit plans, and income-tax related balances are recognized in accordance with accounting guidance that results in measurements that may differ from fair value. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed often involves estimates based on internal or third-party valuations which include appraisals, discounted cash flow analysis, or other valuation techniques that may include estimates of attrition, inflation, asset growth rates, discount rates, credit risk, multiples of earnings, or other relevant factors. The determination of fair value may require us to make point-in-time estimates about discount rates, future expected cash flows, market conditions, and other future events that can be volatile in nature and challenging to assess. While we use the best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, the estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement.
The primary identifiable intangible asset we typically record in connection with a whole bank or bank branch acquisition is the value of the core deposit intangibles which represents the estimated value of the long-term deposit relationships acquired in the transaction. Determining the amount of identifiable intangible assets and their average lives involves multiple assumptions and estimates and is typically determined by performing a discounted cash flow analysis, which involves a combination of any or all of the following assumptions: customer attrition/runoff, alternative funding costs, deposit servicing costs, and discount rates. The core deposit intangibles are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the deposit accounts based on a method that we believe reasonably approximates the anticipated benefit stream from this intangible.  The estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed for reasonableness and have generally been estimated to have a life ranging from seven to ten years, with an accelerated rate of amortization. We review identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Our policy is that an impairment loss is recognized, equal to the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and its fair value, if the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. Estimating future cash flows involves the use of multiple estimates and assumptions, such as those listed above.
The ACL for PCD assets is recognized within business combination accounting with no initial impact to net income. Changes in estimates of expected credit losses on PCD loans after acquisition are recognized as provision expense (or reversal of provision expense) in subsequent periods as they arise. The ACL for non-PCD assets is recognized as provision expense in the same reporting period as the business combination. Estimated loan losses for acquired loans are determined using methodologies and applying estimates and assumptions that were described previously in the Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Allowance for Unfunded Commitments section above.  
Non-PCD loans acquired are generally estimated at fair value using a discounted cash flow approach with assumptions of discount rate, remaining life, prepayments, probability of default, and loss given default.  The actual cash flows on these loans could differ materially from the fair value estimates. The amount we record as the fair values for the loans is generally less than the contractual unpaid principal balance due from the borrowers, with the difference being referred to as the “discount” on the acquired loans. Discounts on acquired non-PCD loans are accreted to interest income over their estimated remaining lives, which may include prepayment estimates in certain circumstances. 
Similarly, premiums or discounts on acquired debt are accreted or amortized to interest expense over their remaining lives. Actual accretion or amortization of premiums and discounts from a business acquisition may differ materially from our estimates impacting our operating results.   
We believe that the accounting for goodwill also involves a higher degree of judgment than most other significant accounting policies. Goodwill arising from business combinations represents the excess of the purchase price over the sum of the estimated fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less the estimated fair 
35
Table of Contents
value of the liabilities assumed. Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.  An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset’s fair value.  
ASC 350-10 establishes standards for an impairment assessment of goodwill.  At each reporting date between annual goodwill impairment tests, we consider potential indicators of impairment.  Generally, absent potential impairment indicators, we perform an annual assessment of whether the events and circumstances resulted in it being more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was less than its carrying value. Impairment indicators considered include the condition of the economy and banking industry; government intervention and regulatory updates; the impact of recent events to financial performance and cost factors of the reporting unit; performance of the Company's stock, and other relevant events. During 2024 there were no triggers warranting interim impairment assessments and for the 2024 annual assessment, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value exceeded its carrying value.  At December 31, 2024, we had $478.8 million of goodwill.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion reviews the results of operations and key drivers to change in the results of 2024 as compared to 2023. For a description of our results of operations for 2023 as compared to 2022, refer to the "Overview and 2023 Highlights," Results of Operations," and "Analysis of Financial Condition and Changes in Financial Condition" sections of Item 7 in our 2023 Form 10-K.
Net Interest Income
Net interest income is our largest source of revenue and is the difference between the interest earned on interest-earning assets (generally loans and investment securities) and the interest expense incurred in connection with interest-bearing liabilities (generally deposits and borrowed funds). Changes in the net interest income are the result of changes in volume and the net interest spread which affects NIM. Volume refers to the average dollar levels of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities. NIM refers to net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets and is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is also influenced by external factors such as local economic conditions, competition for loans and deposits, and market interest rates. 
Net interest income amounted to $332.3 million in 2024, a decrease of $14.6 million, or 4.2%, from $346.8 million in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the increase in rates on interest-bearing deposits, specifically money market accounts, partially offset by lower interest expense on borrowings, a result of lower average balances on borrowings. Partially offsetting the increased interest expense was increased interest income, primarily the result of higher average balances on interest-bearing assets. Within interest-bearing assets, interest income was positively impacted by growth in the average balances of loans and other interest-earning assets, primarily overnight funds, partially offset by lower average balances on taxable securities.  
In line with the lower net interest income related to the increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was the compression of our NIM which, on a tax-equivalent basis, declined to 2.91% in 2024 from 3.06% in 2023.  For internal purposes, we evaluate our NIM on a tax-equivalent basis by adding the tax benefit realized from tax-exempt loans and securities to reported interest income, then dividing by total average earning assets.  We believe that analysis of NIM on a tax-equivalent basis is useful and appropriate because it allows a comparison of net interest in different periods without taking into account the different mix of taxable versus non-taxable loans and investments that may have existed during those periods. The following is a reconciliation of reported net interest income to tax-

Our total cost of deposits has been more impacted by the FOMC's changes in short term rates than the yield on our interest-earning assets.  The target federal funds rate peaked at 5.50% in July 2023 and remained there until beginning to decrease in September 2024, falling a total of 100 basis points by the end of 2024, helping to increase our NIM (tax-equivalent) to 3.07% in the fourth quarter of 2024
. 
 As shown in the chart below, our NIM (tax-equivalent) has grown 27 basis points since its recent low for the first quarter of 2024.  This NIM (tax-equivalent) expansion is the result of our yield on interest-earning assets continuing to earn at higher rates, increasing 11 basis points during the same period, while our total cost of deposits peaked in the third quarter of 2024, declining to 1.57% for the fourth quarter of 2024.

The most significant component of the purchase accounting adjustments in each year was loan discount accretion on purchased loans.  Generally, the level of loan discount accretion will decline each year after an acquisition due to the natural reduction in the outstanding balance of acquired loans. Alternately, levels of accretion will increase as a result of acquisitions and related additions to loan discounts on acquired portfolios which are accreted to income as experienced in 2023 with the GrandSouth acquisition.
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, unaccreted loan discount on purchased loans amounted to $15.1 million and $24.0 million, respectively.  The GrandSouth acquired portfolio comprises the majority of the remaining unaccreted loan discount at December 31, 2024.

Note - Changes attributable to both volume and rate are allocated equally between rate and volume variances.
Overall, as demonstrated in the above table, net interest income contracted $14.6 million in 2024.  Higher rates on interest-bearing liabilities were partially offset by higher rates on interest-earning assets and higher earning asset volumes.    
•
For 2024, higher market rates contributed to an additional $14.6 million of loan interest income while higher loan volume resulted in a $7.8 million increase in interest income. Variable rate loans comprised approximately 23% of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2024, and, accordingly, the magnitude of the immediate yield impact we experience from each rate change is limited. 
•
Decreases in the overall volume of average investment securities, partially offset by higher yields on the portfolio, resulted in decreased interest income of $4.8 million in 2024.
•
Higher volumes on other interest-earning assets (primarily interest-bearing cash balances) along with higher yields resulted in an increase in interest income of $12.8 million for the year. 
•
The increase of $57.2 million in interest expense on deposits was driven by higher rates on accounts as we repriced deposits during late 2023 and the start of 2024 in response to the market increases and to retain and grow deposits to meet our funding needs, combined with higher volumes, primarily in money market deposit accounts.   
•
Lower levels of borrowings, historically short-term FHLB advances to fund loan demand and deposit fluctuations, contributed $12.6 million to the decrease in borrowings interest expense, which, in total, decreased $12.4 million in 2024.   
Provision for Credit Losses and Provision for Unfunded Commitments
The provision for credit losses is comprised of the provision for loan losses and the provision for unfunded commitments. The provision recorded in each period represents the amount required such that the total ACL reflects the current estimate of life of loan credit losses in the loan portfolio and the allowance for unfunded commitments 
40
Table of Contents
reflects the current expected losses on unfunded loan commitments that are expected to result in outstanding loan balances. Our estimate of credit losses is determined using a complex model that relies on reasonable and supportable forecasts and historical loss information to determine the balance of the ACL and allowance for unfunded commitments. The allowance for unfunded commitments is included in "Other liabilities" in the consolidated balance sheets. 
The provision for loan losses was $18.8 million in 2024 and $19.8 million in 2023.  The amount of provision recorded in each period was the amount required such that the total ACL reflected the appropriate balance as determined under the CECL model.  The primary contributor to the lower provision in 2024 was the initial provision established for acquired non-PCD loans of $12.2 million recorded in 2023 as a result of the acquisition of GrandSouth. The provision for loan losses for 2024 included $13 million related to potential credit exposure from Hurricane Helene.  We subscribe to a third-party service which provides quarterly macroeconomic scenarios for the United States economy.  For 2024, we continue to utilize the baseline forecast, which incorporates an equal probability of the United States economy performing better or worse than the projection.  The economic forecasts throughout the year have exhibited general 
stability of the economy demonstrated in relatively low unemployment rates, solid GDP, relatively stable consumer and producer price indices, and mixed results for real estate price indices for commercial and residential properties.
  These improving economic projections translated to lower forecasted losses in our loan portfolio and, thus a lower estimated ACL, exclusive of portfolio growth and the reserves related to Hurricane Helene.  
Also under the CECL method, in 2024 we recorded a reduction in the provision for unfunded commitments of $2.3 million compared to a reduction of $1.9 million for 2023.  Changes in the level of provision each year are generally related to fluctuations in the level of available credit lines and updated loss drivers.  
Within the portions of Western North and South Carolina that were significantly impacted by Hurricane Helene, the Company identified borrowers with approximately $744 million of loans outstanding as of December 31, 2024. The Company continues to update analyses to identify impacts from the storm and has applied increased reserve rates based upon severe economic factors to the loans in the path of Helene. Additionally, the Company continues to evaluate the largest commercial loans in that population and applied incremental reserves to those loans that were suspected of having higher potential property damage or economic impact from the storm. The incremental reserve for potential exposure from Hurricane Helene was $13.0 million and added 16 basis points to the Allowance for Credit Losses as of December 31, 2024.
Additional discussion of the CECL method and our asset quality and credit metrics, which impact our provision for credit losses, is provided in the "Nonperforming Assets" and "Allowance for Credit Losses and Loan Loss Experience" sections following.
Noninterest Income
Our noninterest income amounted to $17.9 million in 2024, $57.3 million in 2023, and $67.8 million in 2022. 
The decreased noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 is a result of "Securities losses, net" in 2024 and lower "Other income, net," partially offset by increased "SBA loan sale gains." Details of the more significant components of noninterest income are presented in the table below. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the change in "Other income, net" was related to the timing of the recognition of gain and loss from other investment activity, which does not include AFS or HTM securities.

Other service charges - other
 includes items such as ATM charges, wire transfer fees, safety deposit box rentals, fees from sales of personalized checks, and check cashing fees. Also included in this category are SBA guarantee servicing fees and related servicing rights amortization which fluctuate based on the volume of and prepayment speeds on SBA loans serviced for others. The increase in this item in 2024 was of $0.2 million, or 1.5%.
Securities losses, net
 was $38.0 million in 2024.  Of this balance, $36.8 million related to a securities loss-earnback transaction from the fourth quarter in which the Company sold $283.8 million of AFS securities bearing 1.62% at a loss of approximately $36.8 million and a purchased a total of $494.9 million in AFS securities bearing 5.21%.
Other gains, net
 amounted to a net gain of $1.0 million for 2024.  For 2022, the balance consisted primarily of death benefits realized on BOLI policies which were nominal in 2023 and 2024.  The decline from 2023 to 2024 was primarily driven by SBA consulting fees, which declined from $2.6 million in 2022 to $0.3 million in 2024 as the Company ceased offering these services in early 2024.
Noninterest Expenses
Total noninterest expenses totaled $235.6 million, $254.4 million, and $195.2 million, for 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.  
The primary contributors to the $18.8 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 were the $13.7 million of "Merger and acquisition expenses" recorded in 2023 and the $1.9 million decrease in "Non-credit losses."  For the year ended December 31, 2024, there was an overall effort by management to actively control headcount and expenses.

Noninterest expenses decreased 7.4% from 2023 to 2024.  The decrease was driven by the merger and acquisition expenses of $13.7 million recorded in 2023 related to the acquisition of GrandSouth along with other elevated expenses from the acquisition. 
Non-credit losses decreased $1.9 million as compared to the prior year driven by the implementation of additional measures to detect and prevent losses that led to a decrease in check fraud losses for 2024. Impacting noninterest expense in 2023 were increases for software costs related to the GrandSouth acquisition, including the transition of new customers.  These costs did not continue in  2024.  Occupancy and equipment expense in 2023 included elevated expenses related to building repairs and maintenance.
Offsetting the previously discussed decreases in noninterest expenses, was the increase in credit card rewards and other bankcard expenses, which were related to higher volumes of customer accounts and transactions.
Income Taxes
We recorded income tax expense of $21.9 million in 2024, $27.8 million in 2023, and $38.3 million in 2022. Our effective tax rates were at 22.3% for 2024, 21.1% for 2023, and 20.7% for 2022.  The slight increase in effective tax rate for 2023 was attributable primarily to merger and acquisition expenses recorded resulting in non-deductible adjustments for tax purposes.  The higher effective tax rate for 2024 was attributable primarily to incremental state tax-related expense related to prior years, changes in state tax income apportionment, and the negative impact of decreasing deferred tax assets related to the North Carolina corporate income tax reduction effective January 1, 2025 and for future years.
ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION
Loans
The loan portfolio is the largest category of our earning assets and is comprised of commercial loans, real estate mortgage loans, real estate construction loans, and consumer loans.  The majority of our loan portfolio is within our North Carolina and South Carolina market areas.  We also have a portfolio of SBA loans that have been made on a nationwide basis. The diversity of the economic bases of our market areas has historically provided a stable lending environment.

The majority of our loan portfolio over the years has been real estate mortgage loans, including commercial and residential mortgages.  All loan categories secured by real estate, including construction and land loans, have historically ranged from approximately 82% to 90% of the loan portfolio.  Except for construction, land development, and other land loans, the majority of our real estate loans are personal and commercial loans where cash flow from the borrower’s occupation or business is the primary repayment source, with the real estate pledged providing a secondary repayment source.
The largest component of our portfolio is non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, followed by residential 1-4 family real estate and owner occupied commercial real estate loans.  As demonstrated in the table above, while there have been some variations in the relative percentage of each loan category to the total portfolio over the years, the nature of our portfolio has not changed drastically from the prior year or the historical averages.  The higher percentage for commercial and industrial loan category in 2020 was an anomaly related to PPP loans made under the provisions of the CARES Act, which were forgiven in accordance with the PPP loan provisions starting in late 2020 and through early 2022.

Note: The above table is based on contractual scheduled maturities. Early repayment of loans or renewals at maturity are not considered in this table.
Approximately 12% of our accruing loans outstanding at December 31, 2024 mature within one year and 59% of total loans mature within five years.  As of December 31, 2024, the percentages of variable rate loans and fixed rate loans as compared to total performing loans were 23% and 77%, respectively.  During 2024, the Company continued to focus on shifting more loans to variable rates as the mix was 19% variable and 81% fixed at December 31, 2023.  While fixed rate loans present market interest rate risk, we measure our interest rate risk closely.  Refer to additional discussion in the section “Interest Rate Risk” below.
The Company’s loan portfolio is not concentrated in loans to any single borrower or to a relatively small number of borrowers. Additionally, management is not aware of any concentrations of loans to classes of borrowers or industries that would be similarly affected by economic conditions.
In addition to monitoring potential concentrations of loans to particular borrowers or groups of borrowers, industries, and geographic regions, the Company monitors exposure to credit risk that could arise from potential concentrations of lending products and practices such as loans that subject borrowers to substantial payment increases (e.g. principal deferral periods, loans with initial interest-only periods, etc.), and loans with high loan-to-value ratios. Additionally, there are industry practices that could subject the Company to increased credit risk should economic conditions change over the course of a loan’s life. For example, the Bank makes variable rate loans and fixed rate principal-amortizing loans with maturities prior to the loan being fully paid (i.e. balloon payment loans). These loans are underwritten and monitored to manage the associated risks. The Company has determined that there is no concentration of credit risk associated with its lending policies or practices.

Most of our business activity is with customers located within the markets where we have banking operations. Therefore, our exposure to credit risk is significantly affected by changes in the economy within our markets. Approximately 88% of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate and is therefore susceptible to changes in real estate valuations.
The following tables provides a summary of the outstanding balances of the commercial real estate-owner occupied, commercial real estate-non owner occupied and multi-family real estate loan portfolio compositions at December 31, 2024 by geographic region.
