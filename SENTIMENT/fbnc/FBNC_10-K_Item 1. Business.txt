Item 1. Business section, we do not have concentrations geographically or by CRE category.
Nonperforming Assets
NPAs include nonaccrual loans, modifications to borrowers in financial distress, loans past due 90 or more days and still accruing interest, foreclosed real estate and, prior to the adoption of ASU 2022-02, accruing TDRs. 
Nonaccrual loans are loans on which interest income is no longer being recognized or accrued because management has determined that the collection of interest is doubtful. Placing loans on nonaccrual status negatively impacts earnings because (1) interest accrued but unpaid as of the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is reversed and deducted from interest income; (2) future accruals of interest income are not recognized until it becomes probable that both principal and interest will be paid; and (3) principal charged-off, if appropriate, may necessitate additional provisions for loan losses that are charged against earnings. As a matter of policy, we generally place all loans that are past due 90 or more days on nonaccrual basis.  There were no accruing loans that were past due 90 or more days at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
In some cases, where borrowers are experiencing financial difficulties, loans may be restructured to provide terms significantly different from the originally contracted terms.

Our asset quality continues to be strong as demonstrated by stable or improving trends in all ratios as presented in the table above.  Our total nonperforming loans to total loans was 0.52% at December 31, 2024, while our total NPA ratio was 0.39% at that date.  Additional discussion of the credit quality classification status of our loans is contained in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.
"Commercial and industrial" is the largest category of nonaccrual loans, at $9.8 million, or 30.9% of total nonaccrual loans, followed by "Residential 1-4 family real estate" at $9.5 million, or 29.9% of total nonaccrual loans and "Commercial real estate - owner occupied" at $9.4 million, or 29.5% of total nonaccrual loans. 
As of December 31, 2024, SBA loans accounted for approximately $15.5 million of our nonaccrual loans, or 11.4%, of the total SBA portfolio, and carried guarantees from the SBA totaling $7.4 million.  This is compared to $18.2 million, or 12.7%, of the SBA portfolio at December 31, 2023.  We continue to closely monitor the SBA loan portfolio and give it appropriate consideration when evaluating the adequacy of the ACL as those loans are generally considered inherently more risky than other loans in our portfolio. Refer to additional discussion of the ACL below. 
As shown in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, our accruing past due loans (30 or more days) totaled $38.0 million at December 31, 2024, with the majority (52.8%) being in the residential 1-4 family real estate category.  
We classify loans as “special mention” when there is a defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the repayment by the borrower and there is a distinct possibility that we could sustain some loss if the deficiency is not corrected. Performing special mention loans, which are still accruing interest, totaled $37.1 million and $44.1 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  In addition, loans that are in the risk category of "classified" which are still accruing interest totaled $34.0 million at December 31, 2024 and $22.0 million at December 31, 2023.  These loans have a risk of further deterioration and potential loss to the Bank.

Table of Contents
Total foreclosed real estate amounted to $5.0 million at December 31, 2024, compared to $0.9 million in 2023.  Nine properties were added to foreclosed real estate during 2024 and we completed the sale of five properties during the year. Two of the 2024 additions were within the population that sold in 2024. 
Allowance for Credit Losses, Allowance for Unfunded Commitments, and Loan Loss Experience
The total ACL amounted to $122.6 million at December 31, 2024 compared to $109.9 million at December 31, 2023.  Fluctuations in the ACL are based on loan mix and growth, changes in the levels of nonperforming loans, economic forecasts impacting loss drivers, other assumptions and inputs to the CECL model, and as occurred in 2023, adjustments for acquired loan portfolios. As discussed previously in the "Provision for Credit Losses and Provision for Unfunded Commitments" section, much of the change to the level of ACL during the year ended December 31, 2024 resulted from the provision of $13.0 million related to potential impact from Hurricane Helene. The ACL as a percent of loans at December 31, 2024 was 1.51%, 16 basis points of which was attributable to the potential impact from Hurricane Helene. 
Within the portions of Western North and South Carolina that were significantly impacted by Hurricane Helene, the Company identified borrowers with approximately $744 million of loans outstanding. The following is a summary of the categories of those loans outstanding as of December 31, 2024:

The Company continues to update analyses to identify impacts from the storm and has applied increased reserve rates based upon severe economic factors to the loans in the path of Helene. Additionally, the Company continues to evaluate the largest commercial loans in that population and applied incremental reserves to those loans that were suspected of having higher potential property damage or economic impact from the storm. 
The ACL reflects our estimate of life of loan expected credit losses that will result from the inability of our borrowers to make required loan payments. We use systematic methodologies to determine the ACL for loans and the allowance for certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures. The ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loan portfolio.  
We consider the effects of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectability of the loan portfolio. Our estimate of the ACL involves a high degree of judgment. Therefore, the process for determining expected credit losses may result in a range of expected credit losses. The ACL is calculated using collectively evaluated pools for loans with similar risk characteristics applying the DCF method. When a loan no longer shares similar risk characteristics with its segment, the loan is evaluated on an individual basis applying a DCF or asset approach for collateral-dependent loans.  Refer also to the discussion of the critical estimates utilized in the ACL in the prior section, Critical Accounting Estimates, and refer to Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our CECL methodology used to determine the ACL.
Our assessment of the ACL involves uncertainty and judgment and is subject to change in future periods. The amount of any changes could be significant if the assessment of loan quality or collateral values changes substantially with respect to one or more loan relationships or portfolios or if there is a significant change in the reasonable and supportable forecast used to model our expected credit losses. The allocation of the ACL as presented in the following table is based on reasonable and supportable forecasts, historical data, subjective judgment, and estimates and therefore, may not be predictive of the specific amounts or loan categories in which charge-offs may ultimately occur. In addition, bank regulatory authorities, as part of their periodic examination of the 
48
Table of Contents
Bank, may require adjustments to the provision for loan losses in future periods if, in their opinion, the results of their review warrant such additions. 
The following table sets forth the allocation of the ACL by loan category at the dates indicated.  However, the ACL is available to absorb losses in any and all categories.

The decrease in securities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily due to regular principal repayments received on mortgage-backed securities as well as maturities of other securities.  Generally, we invested cash flows from amortizing investments in interest bearing cash deposits.  During 2024, we sold $426.7 million of securities, with a weighted average yield of 1.93%
,
 at a loss of $
41.5
 million and we purchased $495.0 million of securities, with a weighted average yield of 5.21%. Partially offsetting this loss was a $
4.5
 million gain on the sale of the Class B shares of Visa, Inc. stock.  Also impacting the change in balances of AFS securities was the improvement in unrealized loss on AFS securities which was $368.1 million at December 31, 2024 as compared to $400.7 million at December 31, 2023.
The composition of the investment securities portfolio reflects our investment strategy of maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity while providing a relatively stable source of income. The investment portfolio also provides a balance to interest rate risk and credit risk in other categories of the balance sheet while providing a vehicle for the investment of available funds, furnishing liquidity, and supplying securities to pledge as required collateral for certain deposits. Essentially all of our mortgage-backed securities, which include both AFS and HTM securities, are issued by GSEs or GNMA, and are traded in liquid secondary markets. These securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value for the AFS portfolio and at cost for the HTM portfolio.
The table below presents the composition, tax equivalent yields, and remaining maturities of our securities as of December 31, 2024. For more information about these securities, including gross unrealized gains and losses by type of security and securities pledged, see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.

Mortgage-backed securities are shown maturing in the periods consistent with their estimated lives based on expected prepayment speeds.

Yields have been computed using coupon interest, adding discount accretion or subtracting premium amortization, as appropriate, on a ratable basis over the life of each security. Weighted average yield for each maturity range has been computed on a fully taxable-equivalent basis using the amortized cost of each security in that range. Yields on tax-exempt investments have been adjusted to a taxable equivalent basis using a 23.35% tax rate.
Nearly all of our $1.9 billion in AFS mortgage-backed securities at December 31, 2024 were issued by the FHLMC, FNMA, GNMA, or the SBA, each of which is a government agency or a GSE and guarantees the repayment of the securities. Included in this total are private-label commerical mortgage-backed securities of $0.7 million. Mortgage-backed securities vary in their repayment in correlation with the underlying pools of mortgage loans.
At December 31, 2024, we held $520.0 million in securities classified as HTM, which are carried at amortized cost.  These securities had fair values that were lower than their carrying values by $91.4 million at December 31, 2024.  Approximately $9.2 million of the HTM securities were mortgage-backed securities that have been issued by either the FHLMC or FNMA.  The remaining $510.8 million in HTM securities were comprised almost entirely of highly-rated municipal bonds issued by state and local governments throughout the nation.  We have no significant concentration of bond holdings from one state or local government entity, with the single largest exposure to any one entity being $8.9 million.  We have evaluated any unrealized losses on individual securities at each year end and determined them to be of a temporary nature and caused by fluctuations in market interest rates, not by concerns about the ability of the issuers to meet their obligations.
Deposits
Deposits represent the primary funding source for our loans and investments. Total deposits amounted to $10.5 billion at December 31, 2024, an increase of $498.9 million, or 5.0%, from December 31, 2023.  Deposit growth for the year was entirely organic as there were no acquisitions during 2024.  Accounting for most of the growth during 2024, retail deposits grew $501.9 million, or 5.0%, from the prior year end.  Brokered deposits ended 2024 at $9.6 million.  We continue to have a diversified and granular deposit base which has remained a stable source of funding. At December 31, 2024, noninterest-bearing deposits accounted for 32% of total deposits.  This contributes to our low cost of funds.

Table of Contents
The table below presents our historical deposit mix which continues to be predominately transaction and non-time deposit accounts.  As demonstrated in the below table, total time deposits have declined to 8% of total deposits at December 31, 2024 from 13% at December 31, 2020.  Such a shift in mix is beneficial for us, as non-time deposit accounts generally carry lower interest rates compared to time deposits and we are able to reprice these deposit categories as market rates move over time.  Approximately 97% of our time deposits mature within one year.

While our customer deposits have remained fairly stable, there continues to be competition for deposits by both in-market and out-of-market competitors.  We routinely engage in activities designed to grow and retain deposits, including emphasizing relationship banking to new and existing customers where borrowers are encouraged to maintain deposit accounts with us; pricing deposits at rate levels that will attract and/or retain deposits; and continually working to identify and introduce new products that will attract customers or enhance our appeal as a primary provider of financial services.

As shown above, time deposits in excess of $250,000 totaled $360.9 million at December 31, 2024. On an individual account basis, there was a total of $185.0 million which was in excess of $250,000.  This assessment of time deposit accounts does not evaluate total deposit relationships, account ownership types or other factors for determining the actual uninsured balances by customer.
As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the estimated uninsured deposits we held totaled approximately $4.1 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, our insured were $6.4 billion, or 61.0% of total deposits, and $6.3 billion or 63.3% of total deposits. When coupled with deposits collateralized by investment securities with balances totaling $690.5 million and $820.9 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, approximately 67.6% and 71.5% of our total deposits were insured or collateralized as December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.  
We do not take deposits through foreign offices. Deposits at December 31, 2024 from foreign depositors were nominal.
Borrowings
Although not the case as of December 31, 2024, we have historically utilized short-term borrowings to provide balance sheet liquidity and to fund imbalances in our loan growth compared to our deposit growth. In addition, we have long-term debt in the form of trust preferred securities and subordinated debentures and have the availability to borrow from the FHLB or FRB.  
53
Table of Contents
Total borrowings at December 31, 2024 decreased $538.3 million from the prior year end.  Redemptions of FHLB advances comprised $280.0 million of the decrease and redemptions of FRB borrowings under the Bank Term Funding Program comprised $249.0 million of the decrease.  During the year, the Company redeemed $10.0 million of subordinated debentures.

As noted in the table above, at December 31, 2024, we had $77.3 million of borrowings structured as trust preferred capital securities which qualify as Tier I capital for regulatory capital adequacy requirements. The Company issued $46.4 million of these securities with the balance assumed from acquisitions. The $18.0 million of unsecured subordinated debentures are borrowings issued by GrandSouth which we acquired and which qualify as Tier II capital for regulatory capital adequacy requirements.
At December 31, 2024, the Company had several sources of readily available borrowing capacity:
•
An existing borrowing capacity with the FHLB of approximately $1.4 billion which can be structured as either short-term or long-term borrowings, depending on the particular funding or liquidity need, and is secured by a blanket lien on most of our real estate loan portfolio, select investment securities, and our FHLB stock (of which $0.8 million

and $280.9 million were outstanding at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively). 
•
Federal funds lines with several correspondent banks totaling $265.0 million which provide for overnight unsecured federal funds purchased (of which none were outstanding at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023); and,  
•
A line of credit with the Federal Reserve through its discount window borrowing program of approximately $767.4 million which is secured by a blanket lien on a portion of our commercial and consumer loan portfolio (excluding real estate loans) and specific investment securities.  All of this line was available at both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.
Refer to Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our borrowings.  
Liquidity, Commitments, and Contingencies
Our liquidity is determined by our ability to convert assets to cash or to acquire alternative sources of funds to meet the needs of our customers who are withdrawing or borrowing funds, and our ability to maintain required reserve levels, pay expenses, and operate the Company on an ongoing basis. Our primary liquidity sources are net income from operations, cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, and other short-term investments. Our securities portfolio has a high percentage of amortizing mortgage-backed securities generating monthly cash flows. In addition, the portfolio is comprised almost entirely of readily marketable securities, which could also be sold to provide cash. We also maintain available lines of credit from the FHLB and the Federal Reserve, as well as federal funds lines from several correspondent banks which are summarized below.
At December 31, 2024, the Company had several sources of readily available borrowing capacity as described above in the Borrowings section.
Liquidity is evaluated as both on-balance sheet (primarily cash and cash-equivalents, unpledged securities, and other marketable assets) and off-balance sheet (readily available lines of credit or other funding sources). Our overall on-balance sheet liquidity ratio was 17.6% at December 31, 2024.  Our total liquidity ratio, including the $2.4 billion in available lines of credit, was 34.9% as of that date.  The increase in available lines of credit during 2024 
54
Table of Contents
was a result of the redemption of FHLB advances along with additional loan and security collateral being transferred to the FHLB and the Federal Reserve to enhance the levels of off-balance sheet liquidity.  
We continue to manage liquidity sources and believe our liquidity sources, including unused lines of credit, are at an acceptable level and remain adequate to meet our operating needs in the foreseeable future. We will continue to monitor our liquidity position carefully and will explore and implement strategies to increase liquidity if deemed appropriate.
In the normal course of business we have various outstanding contractual obligations that will require future cash outflows. In addition, there are commitments and contingent liabilities, such as commitments to extend credit, that may or may not require future cash outflows. Certain of the outstanding commitments and contingent liabilities, such as commitments to extend credit, are not reflected in the financial statements.
Presented below is a summary of our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2024.

As presented in the table above, at December 31, 2024, we had $24.5 million in standby letters of credit outstanding. We had no carrying amount for these standby letters of credit. The nature of standby letters of credit is that of a stand-alone obligation made on behalf of our customers to suppliers of the customers to guarantee payments owed to the suppliers by the customers. The standby letters of credit are generally for terms of one year, at which time they may be renewed for another year if both parties agree. The payment of the guarantees would generally be triggered by a continued nonpayment of an obligation owed by the customer to the supplier.  In the event that we are required to honor a standby letter of credit, a note, already executed by the customer, becomes effective providing repayment terms and any collateral. 
It has been our experience that deposit withdrawals are generally able to be replaced with new deposits when needed or through short-term advances from the FHLB. We believe that the Bank can meet its contractual cash obligations and existing commitments from normal operations.
Capital Resources and Shareholders’ Equity
Shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2024 amounted to $1.4 billion, a $73.2 million, or 5.3%, incre
ase from
 December 31, 2023.  The two basic components that typically have the largest impact on our shareholders’ equity are net income, which increases shareholders’ equity, and dividends declared, which decreases shareholders’ equity.  Additionally, any stock issuances can significantly increase shareholders’ equity, including those associated 
55
Table of Contents
with acquisitions such as in 2023, and any stock repurchases reduce shareholders’ equity. Finally, fluctuations in the amount of AOCI, generally driven by market interest rate changes resulting in increases or decreases in unrealized gains/losses on AFS securities, can have a significant impact on total equity.  In 2024, the most significant factors that impacted our shareholders' equity were (1) $76.2 million net income reported for 2024, which increased equity, (2) common stock dividends declared of $36.3 million, which reduced equity; and (3) $26.0 million increase in equity related to changes in AOCI driven by lower unrealized losses on AFS securities.
As discussed in “Borrowings” above, we also currently have $77.3 million in trust preferred securities outstanding, all of which qualify as Tier I capital under regulatory standards and  $18.0 million of unsecured subordinated debentures which qualify as Tier II capital for regulatory capital adequacy requirements.  We are not aware of any recommendations of regulatory authorities or otherwise which, if they were to be implemented, would have a material effect on our liquidity, capital resources, or operations.
The Company and the Bank must comply with regulatory capital requirements established by the Federal Reserve and the Commissioner. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. The primary source of funds for the payment of dividends by the Company is dividends received from its subsidiary, the Bank. The Bank, as a North Carolina banking corporation, may declare dividends so long as such dividends do not reduce its capital below its applicable required capital (typically, the level of capital required to be deemed “adequately capitalized”). As of December 31, 2024, approximately $1.1 billion of the Company’s investment in the Bank is restricted as to transfer to the Company without obtaining prior regulatory approval.
Our regulatory capital ratios as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 are presented in the table below. All of our capital ratios significantly exceeded the minimum regulatory thresholds for all periods presented.

Our goal is to maintain our capital ratios at levels at least 200 basis points higher than the regulatory “well capitalized” thresholds set for banks. At December 31, 2024, our leverage ratio was 11.15% compared to the regulatory well capitalized bank-level threshold of 4.00% and our total risk-based capital ratio was 16.63% compared to the 10.50% regulatory well capitalized threshold. The increase in capital levels in 2024 was related to the growth in net income, reduction in risk weighted assets, and improvements in our AOCI unrealized losses on AFS securities, partially offset by the redemption of $10 million of subordinated debentures. 
56
Table of Contents
In addition to regulatory capital ratios, we also closely monitor our ratio of TCE to tangible assets, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The TCE ratio was 8.22% at December 31, 2024 compared to 7.56% at December 31, 2023, with the increase of 66 basis points related primarily to the improvement in our AOCI unrealized loss on AFS securities included in equity.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Derivative Financial Instruments
Off-balance sheet arrangements include transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements pursuant to which we have obligations or provide guarantees on behalf of an unconsolidated entity. We have no off-balance sheet arrangements of this kind other than letters of credit and repayment guarantees associated with our trust preferred securities and subordinated debentures.
In the normal course of business, we are exposed to certain risks arising from both our business operations and economic conditions.  As an element of our risk management strategies, we may enter into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. Derivative financial instruments include futures, forwards, interest rate swaps, options contracts, and other financial instruments with similar characteristics.  
We do not engage in significant derivatives activities, however, in 2023 to accommodate customers, we implemented a program whereby we enter into interest rate swaps with certain commercial loan customers, with offsetting positions to dealers under a back-to-back swap program. At December 31, 2024, the Company's derivative financial instruments consist entirely of customer back-to-back interest rate swaps which are not designated as hedges.  Under this program, the Company executes interest rate swaps with commercial banking customers to facilitate their risk management strategies.  Those interest rate swaps are simultaneously economically hedged by offsetting derivatives that the Company executes with a third party, such that the Company minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions.  As the interest rate derivatives associated with this program are not designated as hedging instruments, changes in the fair value of both the customer derivatives and the offsetting derivatives are recognized directly in earnings.  Refer to Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our derivative positions. 
Current Accounting Matters
We prepare our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with standards established  by, among others, the FASB. Because the information needed by users of financial reports is dynamic, the FASB frequently issues new rules and proposes new rules for companies to apply in reporting their activities. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent rule proposals and changes.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
Market Risk
Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates, exchange rates, and equity prices. The Company’s market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk inherent in the normal course of lending, investing and deposit-taking activities.  We do not have any trading assets or activities. 
Interest Rate Risk 
Net interest income is our most significant component of earnings and we consider interest rate risk to be our most significant market risk.  Our net interest income results from the difference between the yields we earn on our interest-earning assets, primarily loans and investments, and the rates that we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, primarily deposits and borrowings. When interest rates change, the yields we earn on our interest-earning assets and the rates we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities do not necessarily move in tandem with each other because of the difference between their maturities and repricing characteristics and this can negatively impact net interest income.
Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Federal Reserve. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, influence not only the interest we receive on loans and investments and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect the average duration of our mortgage portfolio, investment securities and other interest-earning assets.
Our goal is to structure our asset/liability composition to maximize net interest income while managing interest rate risk so as to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income and capital in either a rising or declining interest rate environment.  Profitability is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A sudden and substantial change in interest rates will generally impact our earnings adversely because the interest rates of the underlying assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed, to the same extent or on the same basis.
Interest rate risk is monitored through the use of three complementary modeling tools: static gap analysis, earnings simulation modeling, and economic value simulation (net present value estimation). Each of these models measures changes in a variety of interest rate scenarios. While each of the interest rate risk models has limitations, taken together they represent a reasonably comprehensive view of the magnitude of our interest rate risk, the level of risk through time, and the amount of exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships.  Static gap, which measures aggregate repricing values, is less utilized because it only measures the magnitude of the timing differences and does not address repricing lags, market influences, or management actions.  Earnings simulation and economic value models, which more effectively measure the cash flow and optionality impacts, are utilized by management on a regular basis and are discussed further below. From the various model results and our expectations regarding future interest rate movements, the national, regional and local economies, and other financial and business risk factors, we quantify the overall magnitude of interest sensitivity risk and then determine appropriate strategies and practices governing asset growth and pricing, funding sources and pricing, and off-balance sheet commitments.
Earnings Simulation Analysis
We use net interest income simulations which measure the short-term earnings exposure from changes in market rates of interest. The model calculates an earnings estimate based on current and projected balances and rates, incorporating our current financial position with assumptions regarding future business to calculate net interest income under varying hypothetical rate scenarios.  This method is subject to the accuracy of the assumptions that underlie the process, but it provides a better analysis of the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates than other analyses, such as the static gap analysis.
Assumptions used in the model are derived from historical trends and management’s outlook.  The model assumes a static balance sheet with cash flows reinvested in similar instruments to maintain the balance sheet levels and current composition. Actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for our balance sheet instruments are input to the model.  The model incorporates market-based assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on the prepayment rate of certain assets and liabilities.  Because these assumptions are inherently uncertain, actual results may differ from simulated results. 
59
Table of Contents
Different interest rate scenarios and yield curves are used to measure the sensitivity of earnings to changing interest rates in both a "shocked" instantaneous parallel move and a "steepening" move of rates. Interest rates on different asset and liability accounts move differently when the federal funds rate changes and such assumptions are reflected in the different rate scenarios.  The model does not take into account any future actions that management may take to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes, and it is our strategy to proactively change the volume and mix of our balance sheet in order to mitigate our interest rate risk.
The following table presents the estimated net interest income sensitivity over a 12-month horizon for the specified rate change levels presented. This change in interest rates assumes parallel shifts in the yield curve and does not take into account changes in the slope of the yield curve.  Further, the estimations are based upon the Company's balance sheet as of period end and is not comparing future results to prior results, but rather comparing hypothetical future results under differing rate scenarios.

(1) - The percentage change represents the projected net interest income for 12 months on a static balance sheet in a stable rate environment as compared to the projected net interest income in the various rate scenarios with immediate and parallel shocks applied to the yield curve.
With the FOMC increasing the target federal funds rate in 2022 and 2023, for December 31, 2023 the Company's sensitivity position was such that in the short-term it was projected that net interest income would likely fall in both a rising and falling rate environment.  
As of December 31, 2024 we expect net interest income to remain relatively stable in a plus 200 basis points or minus 200 basis point interest rate curve parallel shift scenario.  During the last four months of 2024, the FOMC decreased short term rates 100 basis points with a target federal funds rate of 4.25% - 4.50% at December 31, 2024.  As evidenced by our results for 2024, the Company has reacted quickly to interest rate cuts by the FOMC and thus reduced the Company's total cost of deposits, thereby increasing net interest income.  As of December 31, 2024, assuming no change in the shape of the yield curve, the Company is reflecting an asset sensitive position, with relatively smaller changes in the declining scenarios, particularly -100 and -200 basis points.
The shape of the yield curve also has a significant impact on the earnings of financial institutions, including the Company.  Generally speaking, when the yield curve is flat or inverted over time, banks experience a decrease in net interest income.  Conversely, a positively sloping yield curve over time is generally favorable for financial institutions.  Any additional flattening or inversion of the yield curve could have a material negative impact on the Company.
The Company continues to actively manage interest rate risk through the addition of variable rate assets and the pricing of interest bearing deposits. The model results demonstrated in the above table are based on the immediate shock of each of the various rate scenarios and assume a consistent future slope (or lack thereof) of the yield curve (i.e. a parallel shift of the yield curve) in both a rising and falling rate scenario.  
As previously noted, these assumptions are inherently uncertain, and actual results may differ from simulated results.  Further, the interest rate simulation models do not take into consideration growth, changes in balance sheet mix or composition, or other strategies that management would employee in either a rising or a falling rate scenario.

Economic Value Simulation
Economic value simulation is used to calculate the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities over different interest rate environments. Economic values are calculated based on discounted cash flow analysis. The net economic value of equity is the economic value of all assets minus the economic value of all liabilities. The change in net economic value over different rate environments is an indication of the longer-term earnings capability of the balance sheet. The same assumptions are used in the economic value simulation as in the earnings simulation. The economic value simulation uses instantaneous rate shocks to the balance sheet and assumes a static average life of deposits in all interest rate scenarios. 
The following table presents the estimated change in net economic value for the specified change levels presented. This change in interest rates assumes parallel shifts in the yield curve and does not take into account changes in the slope of the yield curve.

(1) - The percentage change represents our economic value of equity in a stable rate environment as compared to the economic value of equity in the various rate scenarios with immediate and parallel shocks applied to the yield curve.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company's EVE exposure to rising rates has improved at all levels and exposure to declining rates has depreciated slightly as the short term rates have fallen about 100 basis points during the last four months of 2024.  The improvement in EVE under a rising rate environment is driven by repositioning of the Company's assets to be less negatively impacted by rising rates, generally through an increase in variable rate assets.  The decline in EVE under some of the declining rate environments is driven by the actual decline in rates during the year as well as repayment of wholesale borrowings through more stable deposits which are modeled to show more fluctuation in EVE, but which are a preferred funding source.  Portions of the Company's deposits are also nearing their modeled floor rates and therefore reflect a negative projected change in value.  Refer also to the discussion above under Earnings Simulation Analysis.

Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices
Our financial statements included in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Report have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires the financial position and operating results to be measured principally in terms of historic dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. 
Nearly all of the Company’s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature, and as such, changes in interest rates (as discussed above) generally affect the financial condition of the Company to a greater degree than changes in the rate of inflation. Although interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the inflation rate, they do not necessarily change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the inflation rate. Inflation affects the Company’s results of operations mainly through increased operating costs, and the impact of inflation on banks in general is normally not as significant as its influence on those businesses that have large investments in plant and inventories.  We review pricing of our products and services, as well as our controllable operating and labor costs in light of current and expected costs due to inflation, to mitigate the inflationary impact on financial performance to the extent possible.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2024 
Note 1. 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation

-
 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of First Bancorp (the “Company”) and its wholly owned subsidiary First Bank (the “Bank”). The Bank has 
two
 wholly owned subsidiaries that are fully consolidated, Magnolia Financial, Inc. ("Magnolia Financial") and First Troy SPE, LLC. The Company is a bank holding company. The principal activity of the Company is the ownership and operation of the Bank, a state chartered bank with its main office in Southern Pines, North Carolina. Magnolia Financial is a business financing company that makes loans throughout the southeastern United States. First Troy SPE, LLC was formed in order to hold and dispose of certain real estate foreclosed upon by the Bank.  The Company is also the parent company for a series of statutory trusts that were formed for the purpose of issuing trust preferred debt securities. The trusts are not consolidated for financial reporting purposes as they are variable interest entities and the Company is not the primary beneficiary.  
The Bank formerly operated a third subsidiary, SBA Complete, Inc. ("SBA Complete"), which specialized in providing consulting services for financial institutions across the country related to Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loan origination and servicing.  During the second quarter of 2024, SBA Complete became inactive with certain activities transitioning to the Bank.
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2023 and 2022 consolidated financial statements to be comparable to 2024. These reclassifications had no effect on net income. Subsequent events have been evaluated through the date of filing this Annual Report Form 10-K.
Use of Estimates 
– The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. The most significant estimates made by the Company in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements are the determination of the allowance for credit losses on loans, the allowance for unfunded commitments, the accounting and impairment testing related to intangible assets, the fair value determination for acquired assets and liabilities, and the resulting accretion or amortization of purchase accounting premiums or discounts.
Business Combinations
 – The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. The accounts of an acquired entity are included as of the date of acquisition, and any excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is capitalized as goodwill. Under this method, all identifiable assets acquired, including purchased loans, and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value.
The Company typically issues common stock and/or pays cash for an acquisition, depending on the terms of the acquisition agreement. The value of common shares issued is determined based on the market price of the stock as of the closing of the acquisition.
Cash and Cash Equivalents

-
 The Company considers all highly liquid assets with original maturities of 90 days or less, such as cash on hand, noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing amounts due from banks and federal funds sold, to be “cash equivalents.”
Securities

-
 Debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as “held to maturity” ("HTM") and carried at amortized cost. Debt securities not classified as held to maturity are classified as “available for sale” ("AFS") and carried at fair value, with unrealized holding gains and losses being reported as other comprehensive income or loss and reported as a separate component of shareholders’ equity.
Interest income includes amortization of purchase premiums or discounts.  Premiums and discounts are generally amortized and accreted into income on a level yield basis, with premiums being amortized to the earliest call date and discounts being accreted to the stated maturity date.  Gains and losses on sales of securities are recognized at the time of sale based upon the specific identification method. 
69
Table of Contents
A debt security is placed on nonaccrual status at the time any principal or interest payments become 90 days delinquent.  Interest accrued but not received for a security placed on nonaccrual is reversed against interest income.
Allowance for Credit Losses ("ACL") -  Securities Held to Maturity 
- The Company measures expected credit losses on HTM debt securities on a pooled basis in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 326 ("CECL").  The estimate of expected credit losses is primarily based on the ratings assigned to the securities by debt rating agencies and the average of the annual historical loss rates associated with those ratings.  The Company then multiplies those loss rates, as adjusted for any modifications to reflect current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts as considered necessary, by the remaining lives of each individual security to arrive at a lifetime expected loss amount.  The CECL assumptions, including reasonable and supportable forecast periods, reversion method, and prepayments as applicable, are consistent with those utilized for the ACL on loans as discussed further below.   Virtually all of the mortgage-backed securities held by the Company are issued by government-sponsored enterprises ("GSEs").  These securities are either explicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government or guaranteed by GSEs that have credit ratings and perceived credit risk comparable to the U.S. government, are highly rated by major rating agencies, and have a long history of no credit losses.  Substantially all of the state and local government securities held by the Company are highly rated by major rating agencies. Accrued interest receivable on HTM debt securities was excluded from the estimate of credit losses. 
Allowance for Credit Losses - Securities Available for Sale - 
For AFS debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company first assesses whether it intends to sell, or if it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis.  If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security's amortized cost basis is written down to fair value. For debt securities AFS that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, the Company evaluates whether any decline in fair value is due to credit loss factors.  In making this assessment, management considers any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors.  If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security is compared to the amortized cost basis of the security.  If the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses on AFS securities is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis.  Any impairment that has not been recorded through an ACL is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).  Changes in the ACL under CECL are recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense.  Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of an AFS security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met.
 Accrued interest receivable on AFS debt securities was excluded from the estimate of credit losses. 
Presold Mortgages Held for Sale

-
 As a part of normal business operations, the Company originates residential mortgage loans that have been pre-approved by secondary investors to be sold on a best efforts basis. The terms of the loans are set by the secondary investors, and the purchase price that the investor will pay for the loan is agreed to prior to the funding of the loan by the Company. Loans are transferred to the investor in a short period following funding in accordance with the agreed-upon terms. The Company records gains from the sale of these loans on the settlement date of the sale equal to the difference between the proceeds received and the carrying amount of the loan.  Additionally, the Company records gains for loans in the process of closing, based on the changes in fair value of the loans and related commitments.  Between the initial funding of the loans by the Company and the subsequent reimbursement by the investors, the Company carries the loans on its balance sheet at fair value.
Loans 
- Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at amortized cost. Amortized cost is the principal balance outstanding, net of purchase premiums and discounts and deferred fees and costs. 
Accrued interest
 receivable related to these loans totaled $
27.6
 million at December 31, 2024 and $
28.0
 million at December 31, 2023, and was reported in accrued interest receivable on the consolidated balance sheets.  Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized in interest income using methods that approximate a level yield without anticipating prepayments.  
Past due status is based on contractual terms of the loan.  A loan is considered to be past due when a scheduled payment has not been received 30 days after the contractual due date. The accrual of interest is generally discontinued when a loan becomes 
90
 days past due and is not well collateralized and in the process of collection, or when management believes, after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts, that the principal or interest will not be collectible in the normal course of business. All accrued interest is reversed against 
70
Table of Contents
interest income when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status. So long as a loan is on nonaccrual status, interest received on such loans is accounted for using the cost-recovery method. Under the cost-recovery method, interest income is not recognized until the loan balance is reduced to zero. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current, there is a sustained period of repayment performance, and future payments are reasonably assured.
Purchased Financial Assets with Credit Deterioration ("PCD") 
- Loans acquired in a business combination that have experienced more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination are considered PCD loans. In determining whether an acquired loan is a PCD loan, the Company considers internal loan grades, delinquency status, and other relevant factors.
At the acquisition date, an estimate of expected credit losses is made for groups of PCD loans with similar risk characteristics and individual PCD loans without similar risk characteristics. The initial amortized cost of PCD loans is determined by reducing the loans par value by the initial ACL, with any difference between the resulting amount and the loans purchase price or acquisition date fair value recorded as a non-credit-related discount or premium.  Discounts and premiums are recognized through interest income on a level-yield method over the life of the loans. Subsequent to initial recognition, PCD loans are subject to the same interest income recognition and impairment model as non-PCD loans, with changes to the ACL recorded through provision expense.
Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans
 -  The ACL is an estimate that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial assets.  The level of the allowance is determined under the CECL methodology and includes management's evaluation of historical default and loss experience, current and projected economic conditions, asset quality trends, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrowers' ability to repay a loan (including the timing of future payments), the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and other pertinent factors.  
Credit losses are estimated on the amortized cost basis of loans, which includes the principal balance outstanding, purchase discounts and premiums, and deferred loan fees and costs. Accrued interest receivable is presented separately on the consolidated balance sheets and excluded from the estimate of credit losses.  Loans are charged off when the Company determines that such financial assets are deemed uncollectible.  The ACL is increased through provision for loan losses and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries. 
The ACL is measured on a collective basis for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics.  The Discounted Cash Flow (“DCF”) method is utilized for substantially all pools, with discounted cash flows computed for each loan in a pool based on its individual characteristics (e.g. maturity date, payment amount, interest rate, etc.), and the results are aggregated at the pool level.  A probability of default and loss given default, as adjusted for recoveries, are applied to the discounted cash flows for each pool, while considering prepayment and principal curtailment assumptions. When the DCF method is used to determine the ACL, management adjusts the effective interest rate used to discount expected cash flows to incorporate expected prepayments.  When management determines that foreclosure is probable or when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty at the reporting date and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date, adjusted for selling costs as appropriate. 
The Company has identified the following primary pools for measuring expected credit losses.  There are additional sub-segmentations within each pool, including risk categories. 
•
Owner occupied commercial real estate loans
 - Owner occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans are secured by commercial office buildings, industrial buildings, warehouses or retail buildings where the owner of the building occupies the property. For such loans, repayment is largely dependent upon the operation of the borrower's business. The Company generally requires loan to value of 
80
% or lower and debt service coverage of 
1.30
x or better.  Terms outside of these guidelines will have strengths to mitigate additional risk. 
•
Non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans
 - These loans represent investment real estate loans secured by office buildings, industrial buildings, warehouses, retail buildings, and multifamily residential housing. Repayment is primarily dependent on lease income generated from the underlying collateral. The Company generally requires loan to value of 
80
% or lower, debt service coverage of 
1.30
x or better and overall lease terms to match or extend beyond the term of the loan.
•
Consumer real estate mortgage loans
 - Consumer real estate mortgage consists primarily of loans secured by 1-4 family residential properties, including home equity lines of credit. Repayment is primarily dependent on the personal cash flow of the borrower and may be affected by changes in general economic conditions. The Company generally requires a debt-to-income below 
40
% on all home equity lines of credit with loan to 
71
Table of Contents
value generally 
80
% or less and a minimum credit score of 
660
.  Portfolio mortgage loans will vary depending on the product, but generally require credit scores of 
640
 or greater, debt to income below 
50
% and loan to value maximum of 
90
%.
•
Construction and land development loans
 - This pool includes loans where the repayment is dependent on the successful completion and eventual sale, refinance or operation of the related real estate project and are thus impacted by market demand and real estate valuations. Construction and land development loans include 1-4 family construction projects and commercial construction projects. Residential construction loans for resale generally have a loan to value of 
85
% or lower.  Loan to value would generally be under 
80
% for commercial speculative construction projects. Owner occupied and non-owner occupied commercial construction projects are underwritten to standard guidelines discussed above.
•
Commercial and industrial loans 
- These loans include loans to business enterprises issued for commercial, industrial and/or other professional purposes. These loans are generally secured by equipment, inventory, and accounts receivable of the borrower and repayment is primarily dependent on business cash flows.  Commercial and Industrial loans generally require debt service coverage of 
1.25
x or better.  The Company typically limits equipment and accounts receivable to loan to value of 
80
% and eligible inventory limited to 
40
% loan to value.
•
Consumer and other loans
 - Consumer and other loans include all loans issued to individuals not included in the consumer real estate mortgage classification, including automobile loans, consumer credit cards and loans to finance education, among others. Many consumer loans are unsecured and repayment is primarily dependent on the personal cash flow of the borrower which may be impacted by changes in economic conditions and unemployment. The Company generally limits consumer loans to those clients with a minimum 
660
 credit score and debt-to-income below 
40
%.  Loan to value will vary based on the collateral type and useful life.
In determining the proper level of default rates and loss given default, management has determined that the loss experience of the Company provides the best basis for its assessment of expected credit losses.  It therefore utilizes its own historical credit loss experience by each loan segment over an economic cycle, while excluding loss experience from certain acquired institutions (i.e., failed banks).  Management considers forward-looking information in estimating expected credit losses.  For substantially all segments of loans, the Company incorporates two or more macroeconomic drivers using a statistical regression modeling methodology.  The Company subscribes to a third-party service which provides a quarterly macroeconomic baseline forecast and alternative scenarios for the United States economy.  The baseline forecast, which incorporates an equal probability of the United States economy performing better or worse than the projection, along with the alternative scenarios, are evaluated by management to determine the best forecast to use for macroeconomic factors in the model.  
Management has also evaluated the appropriateness of the reasonable and supportable forecast scenarios utilized for each period and has made adjustments as needed.  For the contractual term that extends beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company reverts to the long-term mean of historical factors over 12 quarters using a straight-line approach.  The Company generally utilizes a four-quarter forecast and a 12-quarter reversion period to the long-term average, which is then held static for the remainder of the life of the loans.
Included in its systematic methodology to determine its ACL on loans, management considers the need to qualitatively adjust expected credit losses for information not already captured in the loss estimation process.  These qualitative adjustments consider a range of maximum and minimum loss rates and can either increase or decrease the quantitative model estimation (i.e., formulaic model results).  Each period the Company considers qualitative factors that are relevant within the qualitative framework that includes the following: 1) changes in lending policies, procedures, and strategies, 2) changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio, 3) staff experience, 4) changes in volume and trends in classified loans, delinquencies, and nonaccrual loans, 5) concentration risk, 6) trends in underlying collateral value, 7) external factors, including competition and legal and regulatory factors, 8) changes in the quality of the Company's loan review system, and 9) economic conditions not already captured.
Allowance for Credit Losses - Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposure
 - The Company estimates expected credit losses on commitments to extend credit over the contractual period (unfunded commitments) in which the Company is exposed to credit risk on the underlying commitments, unless the obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The allowance for unfunded commitments, which is reflected within "Other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets is adjusted for as an increase or decrease to the provision for credit losses for unfunded commitments. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life. The allowance is calculated 
72
Table of Contents
using the same aggregate reserve rates calculated for the funded portion of loans at the portfolio level applied to the amount of commitments expected to fund.
Financial Difficulty Modifications ("FDM")
 -  A loan that is refinanced or restructured by the Company when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty is generally considered a FDM.  Such modification is evaluated to determine if the changes to the loan result in a new loan or a continuation of the existing loan, and to determine the appropriate treatment of deferred loan fees/costs, (i.e. to recognize in income if considered a new loan or to continue amortization if determined to be a continuation of the loan).  The ACL on a FDM is measured using the same method as all other loans held for investment.  FDMs that share similar risk characteristics and consistently discounted based on the post-modification effective rate.    
Troubled Debt Restructurings ("TDR")
 - Prior to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2022-02 on January 1, 2023, a TDR was generally considered a loan for which the terms were modified resulting in a more than insignificant concession, and for which the borrower was experiencing financial difficulties. The ACL on a TDR was measured using the same method as all other loans held for investment, except that the original interest rate was used to discount the expected cash flows, not the rate specified within the restructuring.

Small Business Administration ("SBA") Loans Held for Sale and SBA Retained Loan Discount 
– All SBA loans originated are underwritten and documented as prescribed by the SBA.  SBA loans are generally fully amortizing and have maturity dates and amortizations of up to 
25
 years.  The portion of SBA loans originated that are guaranteed and intended for sale on the secondary market may be classified as held for sale if the Company intends to sell them in the near future and generally has acceptable bids for such loans.  SBA loans classified as held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value.  The Company generally sells the guaranteed portion of the SBA loan as soon as it is eligible to be sold and retains the servicing right.  When the guaranteed portion of an SBA loan is sold, the Company allocates the carrying basis of the loan between the guaranteed portion of the loan sold, the unguaranteed portion of the loans retained, and the servicing asset based on their relative fair values.  A gain is recorded for the difference between the proceeds received from the sale and the basis allocated to the sold portion. The relative fair value allocation results in a discount that is recorded on the unguaranteed portion of the loan that is retained.  The discount is amortized as a yield adjustment over the life of the loan, so long as the loan performs.

SBA Servicing Assets 
- When the Company sells the guaranteed portion of an SBA loan, the Company continues to perform the servicing on the loan and collects a fee related to the sold portion of the loan.  A SBA servicing asset is recorded for the fair value of that fee based on an analysis of discounted cash flows that incorporates estimates of (1) market servicing costs, (2) market-based prepayment rates, and (3) market profit margins.  SBA servicing assets are included in “Other assets” on the consolidated balance sheets.  SBA servicing assets are initially recorded at fair value and amortized against income over the lives of the related loans as a reduction of servicing fee income, generally 
five years
. SBA servicing asset amortization expense is recorded in noninterest income as an offset to SBA servicing fees within the line item "Other service charges and fees" on the consolidated statement of income.  SBA servicing assets are tested for impairment on a quarterly basis by comparing their estimated fair values, aggregated by year of origination, to the related carrying values.  Changes in observable market data relating to market interest rates, loan prepayment speeds, and other factors, could result in impairment or reversal of impairment of these servicing assets and, as such, impact the Company's financial condition and results of operations.
Transfers of Financial Assets
 - Transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales, when control over the assets has been relinquished.  Control over financial assets is deemed to be surrendered when the assets have been isolated from the Company, the transferee obtains the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets, and the Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity. If the sale criteria are not met, the transfer is recorded as a secured borrowing in which the assets remain on the balance sheet and the proceeds from the transaction are recognized as a liability.
Premises and Equipment

-
 Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Recorded within noninterest expense as "Occupancy expense" on the consolidated statements of income, depreciation, computed by the straight-line method, is charged to operations over the estimated useful lives of the properties or, in the case of leasehold improvements, over the term of the lease, if shorter. Land is carried at cost.  Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations in the year incurred. Gains and losses on dispositions are included in current operations and are recorded within noninterest expense on the "Other operating expenses" line on the consolidated statements of income.

73
Table of Contents
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

-
 Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Identifiable intangible assets, primarily core deposit intangibles ("CDI"), are recognized separately and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which for the Company has generally been 
five
 to 
ten years
 and at an accelerated rate. Goodwill is recognized in business combinations to the extent that the price paid exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired, including any identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is subject to fair value impairment tests on at least an annual basis.
Foreclosed Properties

-
 Foreclosed properties consists primarily of real estate acquired by the Company through legal foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure. The property is initially carried at the estimated fair value of the property less estimated selling costs.  Subsequent to foreclosure, any decline in fair value or gain or loss on disposition are recorded through noninterest expense on the "Other operating expenses" line in the consolidated statements of income. Capital expenditures made to improve the property are capitalized. Costs incurred to maintain the property are expensed as incurred and are also included in "Other operating expenses."  Foreclosed properties are included in the "Other assets" line on the consolidated balance sheets and totaled $
5.0
 million and $
0.9
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Bank-Owned Life Insurance
 – The Company has purchased life insurance policies on certain current and past key employees and directors where the insurance policy benefits and ownership are retained by the employer. These policies are recorded at their cash surrender value.  Income from these policies and changes in the net cash surrender value are recorded within noninterest income as “Bank-owned life insurance income” on the consolidated statements of income.

Income Taxes

-
 Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are reduced, if necessary, by the amount of such benefits that are more likely than not expected to be realized based upon available evidence.

Other Investments
 – The Company accounts for its investments in limited partnerships and limited liability companies (“LLCs”) using the equity method of accounting if the percentage ownership and degree of management influence in the investments warrants such accounting treatment.  Under the equity method of accounting, the Company records its initial investment at cost. Subsequently, the carrying amount of the investment is increased or decreased to reflect the Company’s share of income or loss of the investee, recorded within noninterest income as "Other gains, net" on the consolidated statements of income. The Company’s recognition of earnings or losses from an equity method investment is based on the Company’s ownership percentage in the investee and the investee’s earnings on a quarterly basis. The investees generally provide their financial information during the quarter following the end of a given period. The Company’s policy is to record its share of earnings or losses on equity method investments in the quarter the financial information is received.
All of the Company’s investments in limited partnerships and LLCs and their market values are not readily available. The Company’s management evaluates its investments in investees for impairment based on the investee’s ability to generate cash through its operations or obtain alternative financing, and other subjective factors. There are inherent risks associated with the Company’s investments in such companies, which may result in income statement volatility in future periods.
Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") Stock
 - The Company is a member of the FHLB system.  Members are required to own a certain amount of stock based on the level of borrowings and other factors.  FHLB stock is carried at cost and is recorded in "Other assets" on the consolidated balance sheets.  Cash dividends are reported as income, recorded within interest income in the "Other, principally overnight investments" line on the consolidated statements of income.
Federal Reserve Bank ("Federal Reserve", "FRB") Stock
 - The Company is a member of its regional Federal Reserve and is required to own stock based on its level of capital.  Federal Reserve stock is carried at cost and is recorded in "Other assets" on the consolidated balance sheets.  Cash dividends are reported as income, recorded within interest income in the "Other, principally overnight investments" line on the consolidated statements of income.
74
Table of Contents
Loan Commitments and Related Financial Instruments
 - Financial instruments include off-balance sheet credit instruments, such as commitments to make loans and commercial letters of credit, issued to meet customer financing needs.  The face amount for these items represents the exposure to loss, before considering customer collateral or ability to repay.  Such financial instruments are recorded when they are funded.
Leases -
 The Company leases certain branch locations and administrative offices which are generally classified as operating leases with right-of-use assets being included in other assets and the associated lease obligations being included in other liabilities. For leases where the Company is the lessee that have initial terms greater than one year, right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities are reported on the balance sheet. Leases with an initial term of less than one year are not recorded on the balance sheet, rather, the Company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and included in "Occupancy expense" on the consolidated statements of income.

Stock-Based Compensation
 -  Restricted stock awards are the primary form of equity grant utilized by the Company.  Compensation cost is based on the fair value of the award, which is the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of the grant. Restricted stock awards issued by the Company typically have vesting periods with service conditions. Compensation cost is recognized as expense over the vesting period.  For awards with graded vesting, compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.  Because of the insignificant amount of forfeitures the Company has experienced, forfeitures are recognized as they occur.
Earnings Per Share ("EPS") Amounts

-
 Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net income, less income allocated to participating securities, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, excluding unvested shares of restricted stock.  For the Company, participating securities are comprised of unvested shares of restricted stock.  Diluted EPS is computed by assuming the issuance of common shares for all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the reporting period. For the periods presented, the Company’s potentially dilutive common stock issuances related to unvested shares of restricted stock, dilutive stock options and contingently issuable shares which are determined using the treasury stock method.  If any of the potentially dilutive common stock issuances have an anti-dilutive effect, the potentially dilutive common stock issuance is disregarded.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments

-
 Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument, as more fully described in Note 14.  Because no highly liquid market exists for a significant portion of the Company’s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.
Fair value estimates are based on existing on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments.

Impairment

-
 Goodwill is evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis, and more often if a triggering event is identified, by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its related carrying value.  If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company utilizes various valuation techniques to determine whether the implied fair value of the goodwill exceeds its carrying value. If the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess.
The Company reviews all other long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company’s policy is that an impairment loss is recognized if the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. Any long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell. To date, the Company has not recorded any impairment write-downs of its long-lived assets or goodwill.
Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
- Comprehensive income (loss) includes revenues, expenses, gains, and losses that are excluded from earnings under current accounting standards, primarily unrealized gain (loss) on available for sale securities and unrealized and realized gains and losses
 on postretirement benefit plans.
75
Table of Contents
Variable Interest Entities
 - The Company's statutory trust subsidiaries (First Bancorp Capital Trust II, Trust III and Trust IV, Carolina Capital Trust, New Century Statutory Trust I, and GrandSouth Capital Trust I), (collectively "the Trusts") qualify as variable interest entities.  Notes issued by the Company to the Trusts in return for the proceeds from the issuance of the trust preferred securities have terms that are substantially the same as the corresponding trust preferred securities.  As qualified variable interest entities, the Trusts' balance sheet and statement of operations have never been consolidated with those of the Company because the Company is not the primary beneficiary.  Further, the Company has no exposure to loss of the operations of the Trusts as the Company is limited to the repayment of the underlying obligations and would not absorb the losses of the Trusts if losses were to occur.  The trust preferred securities qualify as capital for regulatory capital adequacy requirements.

Segment Reporting
 - Accounting standards require management to report selected financial and descriptive information about reportable operating segments that exceed certain thresholds. The standards also require related disclosures about products and services, geographic areas, and major customers. Generally, disclosures are required for segments internally identified to evaluate performance and resource allocation. The Company’s operations are substantially all within a single banking segment, and the financial statements presented herein reflect the combined results of all of its operations with that segment. The Company has no foreign operations or customers.
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities - 
 The Company occasionally enters into derivative financial instruments as part of its interest rate risk management strategies. These derivative financial instruments consist primarily of interest rate swaps to accommodate certain commercial loan customers, with offsetting positions to dealers under a back-to-back swap program.  All derivative instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as either an asset (included in "Other assets") or liability (included in "Other liabilities") at their fair value.  The Company has master netting agreements with the counterparties with which it does business, but reflects gross assets and liabilities at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets.
The accounting for the gain or loss resulting from the change in fair value depends on the intended use of the derivative. The Company classifies its derivative financial instruments as either (1) a hedge of an exposure to changes in the fair value of a recorded asset or liability (“fair value hedge”), (2) a hedge of an exposure to changes in the cash flows of a recognized asset, liability or forecasted transaction (“cash flow hedge”), or (3) derivatives not designated as accounting hedges ("undesignated hedges"). As of December 31, 2024, the Company has only entered into derivatives classified as undesignated hedges for which changes in fair value are recognized in current period earnings in either noninterest income or noninterest expense. 
The Company also originates certain residential mortgage loans with the intention of selling these loans.  The Company enters into forward sale agreements to mitigate risk and to protect the expected gain on the eventual loan sale. The commitments to originate residential mortgage loans and forward loan sales commitments are freestanding derivative instruments which are entered into as part of an economic hedging strategy to manage exposure related to mortgage loans held for sale.

Note 2. 
Acquisitions
On January 1, 2023, the Company completed its acquisition of 
100
% of GrandSouth Bancorporation ("GrandSouth"), in an all-stock transaction pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the "Merger Agreement"), dated June 21, 2022, between the Company and GrandSouth. At the closing of the transaction, GrandSouth merged into the Company. Following the merger of the Company and GrandSouth, GrandSouth Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of GrandSouth, merged into the Bank with the Bank being the surviving entity. The results of GrandSouth are included beginning on the January 1, 2023 acquisition date. 
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each share of common and preferred stock of GrandSouth issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the acquisition was converted into 
0.91
 shares of the Company's common stock. As a result, the Company issued 
5,032,834
 shares of the Company common stock effective January 1, 2023. In addition, GrandSouth common stock options outstanding at the merger effective time were converted to options to acquire 
0.91
 shares of the Company's common stock resulting in 
542,345
 options with an average exercise price of approximately $
20.14
. The total consideration transferred at the close of the transaction was $
229.5
 million which was determined based on the number of shares issued and the closing market price of the Company's stock immediately prior to the merger effective time of $
42.84
. In addition to the stock issued, the fair value of the converted stock options calculated in accordance with ASC 805-30-55 was included in the total consideration of the transaction.
As a result of the merger, 
eight
 branches in South Carolina were added to the Company's branch network. The acquisition accomplished the Company's strategic initiative to expand its presence in South Carolina, specifically in the high-growth markets of the state including Greenville, Charleston and Columbia. Significant synergies were anticipated to be gained from the acquisition, with asset growth and revenue enhancement opportunities from the new markets and expanded customer base. Accordingly, the Company recognized goodwill in the transaction related primarily to the reasons noted, as well as the positive earnings of GrandSouth.
77
Table of Contents
This transaction was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, and accordingly, the assets acquired, intangible assets identified, and liabilities assumed of GrandSouth were recorded based on estimates of fair values as of January 1, 2023. The determination of fair value requires management to make estimates about discount rates, future expected cash flows, market conditions, and other future events that are highly subjective in nature and subject to change. Estimated fair values were based on management’s best estimates, using the information available at the date of acquisition, including the use of third-party valuation specialists. Management has finalized the valuations of all acquired assets and liabilities assumed in the GrandSouth acquisition.
The following table summarizes the fair value of acquired assets, identified intangible assets, and liabilities assumed as of January 1, 2023. 
Following the table is a discussion of valuation approaches utilized in estimating the fair values. The $
114.5
 million in goodwill that resulted from this transaction is non-deductible for tax purposes.

The following is a description of the methods used to determine the fair values of significant assets acquired and liabilities assumed included in the table above.
Cash and cash equivalents:
 This consists primarily of cash and due from banks, and interest-bearing deposits with banks. The carrying amount of these assets was a reasonable estimate of fair value based on the short-term nature of these assets.
Securities available for sale:
 Fair value of securities was measured based on quoted market prices, where available. If a quoted market price was not available, fair value was estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities and adjusted for differences between the quoted instrument and the instrument being valued. Substantially all of the securities acquired from GrandSouth were liquidated at their recorded fair value upon close of the transaction or shortly thereafter. There was no gain or loss recorded on the sale of acquired securities.
Loans:
 Fair value of loans acquired was based on a discounted cash flow methodology that considered factors including loan type and related collateral, classification status, remaining term of the loan, fixed or variable interest rate, amortization status, and current discount rates. Expected cash flows were derived using inputs consistent with management's assessment of credit risk for allowance measurement, including estimated future credit losses and estimated prepayments. A total fair value mark of $
29.5
 million was recorded. PCD loans were determined based primarily on internal grades, delinquency status, and other evidence of credit deterioration. The Company calculated the initial allowance of $
5.6
 million on PCD loans in accordance with its CECL model and reclassified that amount from the fair value mark to establish the initial ACL on PCD loans.

Premises: 
Land and buildings held for use were valued at appraised values, which reflected considerations of recent disposition values for similar property types with adjustments for characteristics of individual properties.
Intangible assets:
 The CDI asset represents the value of the relationships with deposit customers. The fair value for the CDI asset was estimated based on a discounted cash flow methodology that gave appropriate consideration to expected customer attrition rates, cost of deposit base, net maintenance cost attributable to customer deposits and an estimate of the cost associated with alternative funding sources. The discount rates used for CDI assets were based on market rates. The CDI is being amortized over 
ten years
 utilizing the sum of the months digits accelerated method, which results in a weighted-average amortization period of approximately 
41
 months.
Lease Assets and Lease Liabilities:
 Lease assets and lease liabilities were measured using a methodology that involved estimating the future lease payments over the remaining lease term with discounting using a discount rate. The lease term was determined for individual leases based on management's assessment of the probability of exercising existing renewal options.
Deposits: 
The fair values used for the demand and savings deposits by definition equal the amount payable on demand at the acquisition date. Fair values for time deposits were estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis applying interest rates currently offered to the contractual interest rates on such time deposits.
Borrowings: 
The fair values of long-term debt instruments were estimated based on quoted market prices for instrument if available, or for similar instruments if not available.
Supplemental Pro Forma Financial Information
The following table presents certain pro forma information as if GrandSouth had been acquired on January 1, 2022. These results combine the historical results of GrandSouth with the Company’s results and, while certain adjustments were made for the estimated impact of certain fair value adjustments and other acquisition-related activity, they are not indicative of what would have occurred had the acquisition taken place on January 1, 2022.
Merger-related costs related to this acquisition of $
13.7
 million for 2023 were recorded by the Company and were excluded from the pro forma information below.  In addition, no adjustments have been made to such pro forma information to eliminate the provision for loan losses recorded by GrandSouth in the amount of $
2.2
 million for 2022.
Pro forma information for the year 2023 was adjusted to eliminate the following: 1) the non-PCD provision for loan losses recorded on the acquisition date of $
12.2
 million and 2) the initial recording of a provision for credit losses associated with GrandSouth’s unfunded commitments of $
1.9
 million. If the GrandSouth acquisition had occurred at the beginning of 2022, the acquisition date credit loss reserve amounts would have been included in the fair value measurements of GrandSouth and also included in the goodwill calculation.
The following table also discloses the impact of the acquisition of GrandSouth from the acquisition date of January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2023. These amounts are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023. The operations of GrandSouth have been integrated into existing First Bank operations and therefore separate results of operations are not presented for the year ended December 31, 2024.

As of December 31, 2024, the Company's securities portfolio held 
584
 securities of which 
560
 securities were in an unrealized loss position.  As of December 31, 2023, the Company's securities portfolio held 
657
 securities of which 
632
 securities were in an unrealized loss position.  
In the above tables, all of the securities that were in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2024 and 2023 are bonds that the Company has determined are in a loss position due primarily to interest rate factors and not credit quality concerns.  In arriving at this conclusion, the Company reviewed third-party credit ratings and considered the severity of the impairment. The state and local government investments are comprised almost entirely of highly-rated municipal bonds issued by state and local governments throughout the nation. The Company has no significant concentrations of bond holdings from any one state or local government entity.  Nearly all of the Company's mortgage-backed securities were issued by Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("FHLMC"), Federal National Mortgage Association ("FNMA"), Government National Mortgage Association ("GNMA"), or SBA, each of which is a government agency or GSE and guarantees the repayment of its securities. The Company does not intend to sell these securities, and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell these securities before recovery of the amortized cost.
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company determined that expected credit losses associated with HTM securities and AFS debt securities were insignificant.

At December 31, 2024 and 2023, investment securities with carrying values of $
806.0
 million and $
971.3
 million, respectively, were pledged as collateral for public deposits. In addition, at December 31, 2024 and 2023, investment securities with carrying values of $
661.0
 million and $
679.0
 million, respectively, were pledged as collateral to the FRB to secure any such borrowings. 
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no holdings of securities of any one issuer, other than the US Government and its agencies or GSEs, in an amount greater than 10% of shareholders' equity.
During the second quarter of 2024, the Company sold all of its holdings of Class B shares of Visa, Inc. (“Visa”) stock that were received upon Visa’s initial public offering and recognized a gain of $
4.5
 million. As the Class B stock did not initially have a readily determinable fair value, it was carried at $
0
 prior to the sale. 
During 2024, the Company received proceeds from sales of securities of $
385.1
 million and recorded $
41.5
 million in gross losses from the sales.  These losses were partially offset by the $
4.5
 million

gain on the sale of the Visa stock discussed above.  Also Included in "Securities losses, net" in the consolidated statements of income, during 2024, the Company received proceeds from the call of a security of $
5.2
 million and recorded a $
1.0
 million loss related to the unamortized premium balance at the time of the call.  In 2023, there were no sales of investment securities with the exception of securities acquired from GrandSouth which were subsequently liquidated as discussed in Note 2.  There was 
no
 gain or loss associated with the sale of acquired securities.  In 2022, there were 
no
 sales of investment securities.
Included in “Other assets” in the consolidated balance sheets are investments in FHLB and Federal Reserve stock totaling $
41.3
 million and $
54.5
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These investments do not have readily determinable fair values.  The FHLB stock had a cost and fair value of $
8.5
 million and $
21.7
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and serves as part of the collateral for the Company’s line of credit with the FHLB and is also a requirement for membership in the FHLB system. The Federal Reserve stock had a cost and fair value of $
32.7
 million and $
32.8
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and is a requirement for Federal Reserve member bank qualification. Periodically, both the FHLB and Federal Reserve recalculate the Company’s required level of holdings, and the Company either buys more stock or redeems a portion of the stock at cost. The Company determined that neither stock was impaired at either period end.

3.5
 million respectively.    
At December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, loans in the amount of $
6.7
 billion and $
6.5
 billion, respectively, were pledged as collateral to the FRB and the FHLB for borrowing capacity.  Refer to Note 9 for further discussion.
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, total loans included loans to executive officers and directors of the Company, totaling approximately $
62.9
 million and $
63.7
 million, respectively. There was 
one
 new loan and advances on existing loans totaling approximately $
1.2
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and repayments amounted to $

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, unamortized discounts on all acquired loans totaled $
15.1
 million and $
24.0
 million, respectively.  
Loan discounts are generally amortized as yield adjustments over the respective lives of the loans, so long as the loans perform. There was no impairment of acquired loans during the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 that would require acceleration of amortization or charge off of unamortized discount.
Nonperforming assets ("NPAs") are defined as nonaccrual loans, FDMs, loans past due 90 or more days and still accruing interest, foreclosed real estate, and prior to the adoption of ASU 2022-02 on January 1, 2023, TDRs.

Collateral dependent loans are loans for which the repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty.  The Company reviews individually evaluated loans on nonaccrual with a net book balance of $
500,000
 or greater for designation as collateral dependent loans, as well as certain other loans that may still be accruing interest and/or are less than $
500,000
 in size that management of the Company designates as having higher risk.  These loans do not share common risk characteristics and are not included within the collectively evaluated loans for determining the ACL.

Under CECL, for collateral dependent loans, the Company has adopted the practical expedient to measure the ACL based on the fair value of collateral. The ACL is calculated on an individual loan basis based on the shortfall between the fair value of the loan's collateral, which is adjusted for liquidation costs/discounts, and amortized cost. If the fair value of the collateral exceeds the amortized cost, no allowance is required. 
The Company's policy is to obtain third-party appraisals on any significant pieces of collateral.  For loans secured by real estate, the Company's policy is to write nonaccrual loans down to 
90
% of the appraised value, which considers estimated selling costs.  For real estate collateral, the Company may discount the collateral values due to factors including market trends, collateral condition, or near-term sales.  For loans secured by non-real estate collateral, the Company generally writes nonaccrual loans down to provide for selling costs and liquidity discounts that are usually 
86
Table of Contents
incurred when disposing of non-real estate collateral. For reviewed loans that are not on nonaccrual basis, the Company assigns a specific allowance based on the parameters noted above.  
Fluctuations in the ACL each period are based on loan mix and growth, changes in the levels of nonperforming loans, economic forecasts impacting loss drivers, other assumptions and inputs to the CECL model, and as occurred in 2024, adjustments for acquired loan portfolios. Much of the change to the level of ACL during the year ended December 31, 2024 is attributed to the potential exposure from Hurricane Helene. The balance of the change was a result of loan growth during the year and updated prepayment speed estimates in the CECL model, which have slowed with market rate increases, thus requiring additional allowance for the estimated longer life of loans. 
The following tables present the activity in the ACL on loans for each of the periods indicated.

Credit Quality Indicators
The Company tracks credit quality based on its internal risk ratings. Upon origination, a loan is assigned an initial risk grade, which is generally based on several factors such as the borrower’s credit score, the loan-to-value ratio, the debt-to-income ratio, etc. Loans that are risk-graded as substandard during the origination process are declined. After loans are initially graded, they are monitored regularly for credit quality based on many factors, such as 
87
Table of Contents
payment history, the borrower’s financial status, and changes in collateral value. Loans can be downgraded or upgraded depending on management’s evaluation of these factors. Internal risk-grading policies are consistent throughout each loan type.
The following describes the Company’s internal risk grades in ascending order of likelihood of loss:
Risk Grade
Description
Pass:
1
Loans with virtually no risk, including cash secured loans.
2
Loans with documented significant overall financial strength.  These loans have minimum chance of loss due to the presence of multiple sources of repayment – each clearly sufficient to satisfy the obligation.
3
Loans with documented satisfactory overall financial strength.  These loans have a low loss potential due to presence of at least two clearly identified sources of repayment – each of which is sufficient to satisfy the obligation under the present circumstances.
4
Loans to borrowers with acceptable financial condition.  These loans could have signs of minor operational weaknesses, lack of adequate financial information, or loans supported by collateral with questionable value or marketability.
5
Loans that represent above average risk due to minor weaknesses and warrant closer scrutiny by management.  Collateral is generally available and felt to provide reasonable coverage with realizable liquidation values in normal circumstances.  Repayment performance is satisfactory.
P
(Pass)
Consumer loans that are of satisfactory credit quality with borrowers who exhibit good personal credit history, average personal financial strength and moderate debt levels.  These loans generally conform to Bank policy, but may include approved mitigated exceptions to the guidelines.
Special Mention:
6
Existing loans with defined weaknesses in primary source of repayment that, if not corrected, could cause a loss to the Company.
Classified:
7
An existing loan inadequately protected by the current sound net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the collateral pledged, if any.  These loans have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt.
8
Loans that have a well-defined weakness that make the collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable.  Loss appears imminent, but the exact amount and timing is uncertain.
9
Loans that are considered uncollectible and are in the process of being charged-off.  This grade is a temporary grade assigned for administrative purposes until the charge-off is completed.
F
(Fail)
Consumer loans with a well-defined weakness, such as exceptions of any kind with no mitigating factors, history of paying outside the terms of the note, insufficient income to support the current level of debt, etc.
The tables below present the Company’s recorded investment in loans by credit quality indicators by year of origination or renewal as of the periods indicated. Acquired loans are presented in the year originated, not in the year of acquisition.
In the tables that follow, substantially all of the "Classified" loans have grades of 7 or Fail, with those categories having similar levels of risk.
As presented in the tables that follow, as of December 31, 2024, the Company had $
37.1
 million in loans graded Special Mention and $
65.8
 million in loans graded Classified, which includes all nonaccrual loans at that date.  As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $
44.1
 million in loans graded Special Mention and $
54.2
 million in loans graded Classified, which includes all nonaccrual loans at that date.

Loan Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty
Occasionally, the Company modifies loans to borrowers in financial distress as a part of our loss mitigation activities.  Various types of modification may be offered including principal forgiveness, term extension, payment delays, or interest rate reductions. In some cases, the Company will modify a certain loan by providing multiple types of concessions. Typically, one type of concession, such as a term extension, is granted initially. If the borrower continues to experience financial difficulty, another concession may be granted. For loans included in the “combination” columns below, multiple types of modifications have been made on the same loan within the current reporting period.  
The followings tables present the amortized cost basis at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 of the loans modified during the twelve months then ended for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, by loan category and type of concession granted.

None of the modifications made for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty during the twelve months ended  December 31, 2023 are considered to have had a payment default.
Upon the Company’s determination that a modified loan (or portion of a loan) has subsequently been deemed uncollectible, the loan (or a portion of the loan) is written off. Therefore, the amortized cost basis of the loan is reduced by the uncollectible amount and the ACL is adjusted by the same amount. 
TDR Disclosures Prior to the Adoption of ASU 2022-02
The restructuring of a loan was considered a TDR if both (i) the borrower was experiencing financial difficulties and (ii) the creditor had granted a concession. Concessions may have included interest rate reductions or below market interest rates, principal forgiveness, extension of terms and other actions intended to minimize potential losses.
The vast majority of the Company’s TDRs modified during the year ended December 31, 2022 related to interest rate reductions combined with extension of terms. The Company does not generally grant principal forgiveness.
The Company’s TDRs can be classified as either nonaccrual or accruing based on the loan’s payment status. The TDRs that are nonaccrual are reported within the nonaccrual loan totals presented previously.
The following tables present information related to loans modified in a TDR during periods as indicated.

The Company considered a TDR loan to have defaulted when it became 90 or more days delinquent under the modified terms, had been transferred to nonaccrual status, or had been transferred to foreclosed real estate. There were no accruing TDRs that were modified in the twelve months preceding December 31, 2022 and that defaulted during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022.
Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company’s loan portfolio is not concentrated in loans to any single borrower or to a relatively small number of borrowers. Additionally, management is not aware of any concentrations of loans to classes of borrowers or 
93
Table of Contents
industries that would be similarly affected by economic conditions.  Approximately 
88
% of the Company's loan portfolio is secured by real estate and is therefore susceptible to changes in real estate valuations.
Most of the Company's business activity is with customers located within the markets where we have banking operations.  While our exposure to credit risk is affected by changes in the economy within our markets, the risk is not significantly concentrated. The following table presents the total lending exposure for the counties with the largest percentage of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.  
No other market (as defined by county) had total loans outstanding in excess of 5% of the total portfolio at year end.

Given that the storm impacted the area just prior to September 30, 2024 and recovery continues in many communities, the Company performed analyses to identify possible impacts from the storm and has reserved accordingly based upon the information available as of December 31, 2024. The Company applied increased reserve rates based upon severe economic factors to the approximately $
744
 million of loans in the most impacted path of Hurricane Helene. Additionally, the Company performed an initial evaluation of the largest commercial loans in that area and applied incremental reserves to those loans that were suspected of having higher potential property damage or economic impact from the storm. Due to the potential exposure from Hurricane Helene, the ACL on these impacted loans increased by $
13.0
 million, expanding the ACL as a percent of loans in the impacted geography from 
1.25
% to 
3.00
% as of December 31, 2024 and adding 
16
 basis points to the overall ACL as a percent of total loans, which was 
1.51
% as of December 31, 2024. We offered a 90 day forbearance to those loan customers impacted by Hurricane Helene.
Allowance for Unfunded Loan Commitments
In addition to the ACL on loans, the Company maintains an allowance for lending-related commitments such as unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit.  The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company.  The allowance for lending-related commitments on off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted as a provision for credit loss expense.  The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur, which is based on a historical funding study derived 
94
Table of Contents
from internal information, and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life, which are the same loss rates that are used in computing the ACL on loans, and are discussed in Note 1.  The allowance for unfunded loan commitments were included in "Other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets.

Goodwill is evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis, with the annual evaluation occurring as of October 31 of each year. Goodwill is also evaluated for impairment any time there is a triggering event indicating that impairment may have occurred. No triggering events were identified during 2024 or 2023 and, therefore, the Company did not perform interim impairment evaluations in either of those years. The Company's most recent evaluation of goodwill, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2024, indicated that there was 
no
 goodwill impairment. There was no change to carrying amounts of goodwill during 2024.

The company had recorded deminimis valuation allowances for 2024 and 2023 related to state net operating loss carryforwards for which the realization of the remaining deferred tax assets is determined to be more likely than not. The Company had no significant uncertain tax positions, and thus no such reserve for uncertain tax positions has been recorded. Additionally, the Company determined that it has no material unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would affect the effective tax rate. The Company’s general policy is to record tax penalties and interest as a component of “Other operating expenses.”
The Company is subject to routine audits of its tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and various state taxing authorities.  The Company’s tax returns are subject to income tax audit by federal and state agencies beginning with the year 2021. There are no indications of any material adjustments relating to any examination currently being conducted by any taxing authority.

All outstanding FHLB and FRB borrowings may be accelerated immediately by the FHLB and FRB, respectively, in certain circumstances, including material adverse changes in the condition of the Company or if the Company’s qualifying collateral amounts to less than that required under the terms of the borrowing agreement.
In the above tables, at December 31, 2024, there were 
no
 short-term borrowings (original maturity of less than twelve months).  At December 31, 2023, short-term borrowings totaled $
529.0
 million and had a weighted average interest rate of 
5.25
% .
Trust Preferred Securities in the above tables are borrowings structured as trust preferred capital securities which were issued by various unconsolidated subsidiaries of the Company as discussed in Note 1.  These unsecured debt securities qualify as Tier I capital for capital adequacy requirements.
The Subordinated Debentures in the tables above are borrowings issued by GrandSouth and assumed by the Company on January 1, 2023.  These unsecured debt securities qualify as Tier II capital for capital adequacy requirements.
At December 31, 2024, the Company had several sources of readily available borrowing capacity:
•
A $
1.4
 billion line of credit with the FHLB that can be structured as either short-term or long-term borrowings, depending on the particular funding or liquidity needs.  As of December 31, 2024, the line of credit is secured by a blanket lien on portions of the Company's real estate loan portfolio totaling approximately $
2.4
 billion and the Company's FHLB stock totaling $
8.5
 million.  $

Note 10. 
Leases
The Company enters into leases in the normal course of business.  As of December 31, 2024, the Company leased 
13
 branch offices for which the land and buildings are leased and 
nine
 branch offices for which the land is leased but the building is owned. The Company also leases office space for several operational departments.  All of the Company’s leases are operating leases and the lease agreements have maturity dates ranging from April 2026 to May 2076, some of which include options for multiple 
five
- and 
ten-year
 extensions. The Company includes lease extension options in the lease term if, after considering relevant economic, market, and strategic factors, it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise the option. The weighted average remaining life of the lease term for these leases was 
21.2
 years as of December 31, 2024 and 
19.8
 years as of December 31, 2023.  Certain of the Company's lease agreements include variable lease payments based on changes in inflation, with the impact of that factor being insignificant to the Company's total lease expense.  As permitted by applicable accounting standards, the Company has elected not to recognize leases with original lease terms of 12 months or less (short-term leases) on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.  The short-term lease cost for each period presented was insignificant.
Leases are classified as either operating or finance leases at the lease commencement date, and as previously noted, all of the Company's leases have been determined to be operating leases.  Lease expense for operating leases and short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  Right-of-use assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company's obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.  Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated present value of lease payments over the lease term.
The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate, based on a fully collateralized fully amortizing borrowing with a maturity similar to the lease term, at lease commencement to calculate the present value of lease payments when the rate implicit in the lease is not known.  The weighted average discount rate for leases was 
3.34
% and 
3.19
% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The right-of-use assets, included in "
Other assets
" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet, and lease liabilities, included in "
Other liabilities
" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet were $
13.8
 million and $
14.6

Table of Contents
million as of December 31, 2024, respectively, and were $
17.1
 million and $
17.8
 million as of December 31, 2023, respectively.  
Total operating lease expenses, included in "Occupancy and equipment expenses" in the Company's consolidated statement of income, was $
2.5
 million in 2024, $
3.1
 million in 2023, and $
2.9

Employee Benefit Plans
401(k) Plan

The Company sponsors a retirement savings plan pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC"). New employees who have met the age requirement are automatically enrolled in the plan at a 
6
% deferral rate. The automatic deferral can be modified by the employee at any time. An eligible employee may contribute up to 
15
% of annual salary to the plan, not to exceed IRC limits.  For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company matched 
100
% of the employee’s contribution up to 
4
%, 
6
% and 
6
%, respectively. The Company’s matching contribution expense was $
6.8
 million, $
6.1
 million, and $
4.9
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Although discretionary contributions by the Company are permitted by the plan, the Company did not make any such contributions in the years presented. The Company’s matching and discretionary contributions are made according to the same investment elections each participant has established for their deferral contributions. During 2024, upon the dissolution of the Pension Plan, as discussed below, the remaining balance of plan assets was transferred to the 401(k) Plan, the expense for which is included in the 2024 contribution expense shown above.
Pension Plan

Historically, the Company offered a noncontributory defined benefit retirement plan (the “Pension Plan”) that qualified under Section 401(a) of the IRC.  In 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors (the "Board") approved a resolution to terminate the Pension Plan.  During 2023, the Company commenced the Pension Plan termination process and on July 31, 2023, the Pension Plan was amended to terminate it as of that date.  Subsequently in 2023, the Pension Plan settled benefits through lump-sum payments of approximately $
9.2
 million to eligible participants electing that option and purchased annuity contracts from One America (the "Insurer") which irrevocably transferred to the Insurer approximately $
19.5
 million of the Pension Plan's obligations and related assets, thereby reducing the Pension Plan's obligations at December 31, 2023 to 
zero
.  The Company utilized the remaining surplus for future contributions under the Company’s 401(k) Plan and the remaining balance was transferred to the 401(k) Plan during 2024.
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan

Historically, the Company sponsored a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the “SERP”) for the benefit of certain senior management executives of the Company. The purpose of the SERP was to provide additional monthly pension benefits.  The SERP is an unfunded plan.  Payments are made from the general assets of the Company. Effective December 31, 2012, the Company froze the SERP to all participants.
The following table reconciles the beginning and ending balances of the SERP’s benefit obligation, as computed by the Company’s independent actuarial consultants:

Note 12. 
Commitments and Contingencies
In the normal course of business, there are various outstanding commitments to extend credit that are not reflected in the financial statements.  The same credit policies are used to make such commitments as are used for loans, including obtaining collateral at exercise of the commitment.  Commitments may expire without being used.  
The following table presents the Company’s outstanding loan commitments, including credit cards, at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

In addition to loan commitments, at December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had $
24.5
 million and $
20.6
 million, respectively, in standby letters of credit outstanding. The Company has 
no
 carrying amount for these standby letters of credit at either of those dates. The nature of the standby letters of credit is a stand-alone obligation made on behalf of the Company’s customers to suppliers of the customers to guarantee payments owed to the supplier by the customer. The standby letters of credit are generally for a term of one year, at which time they may be renewed for another year if both parties agree.
The Company maintains an allowance for unfunded loan commitments which is included in "Other liabilities" in the consolidated balance sheets. The allowance for unfunded loan commitments is determined as part of the quarterly ACL analysis.
The Company also periodically invests in limited partnerships and LLCs primarily for the purposes of fulfilling CRA requirements and obtaining tax credits.  As of December 31, 2024, the Company had a remaining funding commitment of $
32.1
 million related to these investments.
The Company, in the normal course of business, may be subject to various pending and threatened lawsuits in which claims for monetary damages are asserted.  The Company is not involved in any legal proceedings which, in management’s opinion, could have a material effect on the consolidated financial position of the Company.
Note 13.  
Derivatives and Hedging Activities 
In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions.  As an element of its risk management strategies, the Company may enter into derivative 
105
Table of Contents
financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates.  To accommodate customers, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps with certain commercial loan customers, with offsetting positions to dealers under a back-to-back swap program.
At December 31, 2024, the Company's derivative financial instruments consist entirely of customer back-to-back interest rate swaps which are not designated as hedges.  Under this program, the Company executes interest rate swaps with commercial banking customers to facilitate their risk management strategies.  Those interest rate swaps are simultaneously hedged by offsetting derivatives that the Company executes with a third party, such that the Company minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions.  As the interest rate derivatives associated with this program are not designated as hedging instruments, changes in the fair value of both the customer derivatives and the offsetting derivatives are recognized directly in earnings.
The Company's derivative instruments are carried at fair value and included in "Other assets" for derivatives with positive fair values and "Other liabilities" for derivatives with negative fair values on the consolidated balance sheets.
The table below presents the fair value of Company’s derivative financial instruments as of the dates indicated.

The table below presents a gross presentation, the effects of offsetting, and a net presentation of the Company’s derivatives as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.  The Company’s interest rate swaps are subject to master netting arrangements between the Company and its counterparties, however, the Company has not made a policy election to offset its derivative positions. The interest rate swaps with borrowers are cross collateralized with the underlying loan and, therefore, there is no posted collateral. Interest rate swap agreements with third-party counterparties contain provisions that require the Company to post collateral if the derivative exposure exceeds a threshold amount and receive collateral for agreements in a net asset position.

The commitments to originate residential mortgage loans and forward loan sales commitments are freestanding derivative instruments which were immaterial at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.
Credit-risk-related Contingent Features
The Company's agreements with its derivative counterparties contain a provision where if either party defaults on any of its indebtedness, then it could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations.  The agreements with derivative counterparties also include provisions that if not met, could result in the Company being declared in default on its derivative obligations, including if repayment of the underlying indebtedness is accelerated by the lender due to the Company's default on the indebtedness.  The Company has provisions in its derivative counterparty agreement providing that if the Company fails to maintain its status as a well-capitalized institution or is subject to a prompt corrective action directive, the counterparty could terminate the derivative positions and the Company would be required to settle its obligations under the agreements.
The Company manages its credit exposure on derivative transactions by entering into a bilateral credit support agreement with each non-customer counterparty.  The credit support agreement requires collateralization of exposure beyond specified minimum threshold amounts.  As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, the fair value of derivatives in a net liability position, including accrued interest, was $
302
 thousand and $
349
 thousand.  As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, the Company has minimum collateral posting thresholds with its derivative counterparty and has posted collateral of $
150
 thousand and $
330
 thousand.

Note 14. 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal and most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) of identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date.
Level 2: Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a reporting entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.

The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value.
Securities Available for Sale
 — When quoted market prices are available in an active market, the securities are classified as Level 1 in the valuation hierarchy. If quoted market prices are not available, but fair values can be estimated by observing quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, the securities are classified as Level 2 on the valuation hierarchy. Most of the fair values for the Company’s Level 2 securities are determined by the Company's third-party bond accounting provider using matrix pricing. Matrix pricing is a mathematical technique widely used in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on 
108
Table of Contents
quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities’ relationship to other benchmark quoted securities. For the Company, Level 2 securities include US Treasury securities, mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed obligations, government-sponsored enterprise securities, and corporate bonds. In cases where Level 1 or Level 2 inputs are not available, securities may be classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy.
The Company reviews the pricing methodologies utilized by the bond accounting provider to ensure the fair value determination is consistent with the applicable accounting guidance and that the investments are properly classified in the fair value hierarchy.
Presold Mortgages in Process of Settlemen
t - The fair value is based on the committed price that an investor has agreed to pay for the loan which is considered a Level 2 input.
Derivative financial assets and liabilities 
- The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts (or payments) and the discounted expected variable cash payments (or receipts).  The variable cash payments (or receipts) are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves.  These are considered a Level 2 input.
Individually evaluated loans
 — Fair values for individually evaluated loans are measured on a non-recurring basis and are based on the underlying collateral values securing the loans, adjusted for estimated selling costs, or the net present value of the cash flows expected to be received for such loans.  Collateral may be in the form of real estate or business assets including equipment, inventory and accounts receivable. The vast majority of the collateral is real estate. The value of real estate collateral is generally determined by third-party appraisers using an income or market valuation approach based on an appraisal conducted by an independent, licensed third party appraiser (Level 3). The value of business equipment is based upon an outside appraisal if deemed significant, or the net book value on the applicable borrower’s financial statements if not considered significant. Likewise, values for inventory and accounts receivable collateral are based on borrower financial statement balances or aging reports on a discounted basis as appropriate (Level 3).  Appraisals used in this analysis are generally obtained at least annually based on when the loans first became impaired, and thus the appraisals are not necessarily as of the period ends presented.  Any fair value adjustments are recorded in the period incurred as provision for credit losses on the consolidated statements of income.  
There were no significant changes in the reported amount of Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on either a recurring or a nonrecurring basis as of December 31, 2024.
The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments not carried at fair value as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:

Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company’s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument. Because no highly liquid market exists for a significant portion of the Company’s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and 
109
Table of Contents
matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.
Fair value estimates are based on existing on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments. Significant assets and liabilities that are not considered financial assets or liabilities include net premises and equipment, intangible and other assets such as deferred income taxes, prepaid expense accounts, income taxes currently payable, and other various accrued expenses. In addition, the income tax ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in any of the estimates.
Note 15. 
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company recorded total stock-based compensation expense of $
4.3
 million, $
4.6
 million, and $
3.0
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, which is include in "Total personnel expense" on the accompanying consolidated statements of income. 
The Company recognized $
1.0
 million, $
1.1
 million, and $
0.7
 million of income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation expense in its income statement for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
At December 31, 2024, the sole equity-based compensation plan for the Company is the First Bancorp 2024 Equity Plan (the "Equity Plan"), which was approved by shareholders on May 31, 2024.  As of December 31, 2024, the Equity Plan had 
1,930,548
 shares remaining available for grant.
The Equity Plan is intended to serve as a means to attract, retain, and motivate key employees and directors and to associate the interests of the Plan's participants with those of the Company and its shareholders. The Equity Plan allows for both grants of stock options and other types of equity-based compensation, including stock appreciation rights, restricted and unrestricted stock, restricted performance stock, and performance units.  For the last several years, the only equity-based compensation granted by the Company has been shares of restricted stock, as it relates to employees, and unrestricted stock as it relates to non-employee directors.
Recent restricted stock awards to employees typically include service-related vesting conditions only. Compensation expense for these grants is recorded over the requisite service periods. Upon forfeiture, any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed.  Upon a change in control (as defined in the Equity Plan), unless the awards remain outstanding or substitute equivalent awards are provided, the awards become immediately vested. 
Certain of the Company’s equity grants contain terms that provide for a graded vesting schedule whereby portions of the award vest in increments over the requisite service period. The Company recognizes compensation expense for awards with graded vesting schedules on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each incremental award.  Compensation expense is based on the estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest. Over the past five years, there have been insignificant amounts of forfeitures, and therefore the Company assumes that all awards granted with service conditions will vest. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur.
In addition to employee equity awards, the Company's practice is to grant unrestricted common shares to each non-employee director (currently 
13
 in total) in June of each year.  These grants were each valued at approximately $
37,500
 in 2024, $
37,500
 in 2023 and $
32,000
 in 2022.  Compensation expense associated with these director awards is recognized on the date of the award since there are no vesting conditions. 
On May 31, 2024, the Company granted 
15,457
 shares of common stock to non-employee directors (
1,189
 shares per director), at a fair market value of $
31.55
 per share, which was the closing price of the Company’s common stock on that date, which resulted in $
487,500
 in expense. On June 1, 2023, the Company granted 
17,094
 shares of common stock to non-employee directors (
1,221
 shares per director), at a fair market value of $
30.69
 per share, which was the closing price of the Company’s common stock on that date, which resulted in $
525,000
 in expense. On June 1, 2022, the Company granted 
10,344
 shares of common stock to non-employee directors (
862
 shares per director), at a fair market value of $
37.12
 per share, which was the closing price of the Company's common stock on that date, which resulted in $
384,000
 in expense. The expense associated with director grants is classified as "Other operating expense" in the consolidated statements of income.

The fair value of the replacement options issued in conjunction with the GrandSouth acquisition as of January 1, 2023 was measured using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. 
The following table illustrates the assumptions for the Black-Scholes model used in determining the fair value of options granted during the year ended December 31, 2023:

The expected life is based on historical exercises and forfeitures experience of the grantees. The volatility is based on historical price volatility.

The risk-free interest rate is based on a U.S. Treasury instrument with a life that is similar to the expected life of the option grant. 
At December 31, 2024, the Company had 
no
 unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options. All unexercised options expire 
ten years
 after the applicable original grant dates under the GrandSouth stock option plan.
Note 16. 
Shareholders’ Equity
Rabbi Trust Obligations
With the acquisition of Carolina Bank in March 2017, the Company assumed a deferred compensation plan structured as a Rabbi Trust for certain members of Carolina Bank’s board of directors that is fully funded by Company common stock.  Subsequent to the acquisition, payments have been made to plan participants and the related asset and liability were both $
1.1
 million at December 31, 2024 and $
1.4
 million at December 31, 2023, respectively, and are presented as components of shareholders’ equity.
Stock Repurchases
Pursuant to authorizations by the Company's Board, the Company from time to time has repurchased shares of common stock in private transactions and in open-market purchases.  On January 30, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the repurchase of up to $
40
 million of the Company’s common stock. Any such repurchases would be made pursuant to a plan approved by and containing provisions about the timing, purchase prices and quantities purchased determined by management in its discretion. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not make any such purchases.

Regulatory Restrictions 
The Company is regulated by the Federal Reserve and is subject to securities registration and public reporting regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Bank is regulated by the Federal Reserve and the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks.
The primary source of funds for the payment of dividends by the Company is dividends received from its subsidiary, the Bank. The Bank, as a North Carolina banking corporation, may declare dividends so long as such dividends do not reduce its capital below its applicable required capital (typically, the level of capital required to be deemed “adequately capitalized”). As of December 31, 2024, approximately $
1.1
 billion of the Company’s investment in the Bank was restricted as to transfer to the Company without obtaining prior regulatory approval.
There was 
no
 average reserve balance requirement under the requirements of the Federal Reserve at December 31, 2024.
The Company and the Bank must comply with regulatory capital requirements established by the Federal Reserve. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company’s assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company’s and Bank’s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors.

The Company’s and the Bank’s respective regulatory capital ratios as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, along with the minimum amounts required for capital adequacy purposes and to be well capitalized under prompt corrective action in effect at such times are presented below.  There are no conditions or events since year-end that management believes have changed the Company’s or the Bank's classification.

A description of the Company’s revenue streams accounted for under ASC 606 is detailed below.
Service charges on deposit accounts:
 The Company earns fees from its deposit customers for transaction-based, account maintenance, and overdraft services. Overdraft fees are recognized at the point in time that the overdraft occurs. Maintenance and activity fees include account maintenance fees and transaction-based fees. Account maintenance fees, which relate primarily to monthly maintenance, are earned over the course of the month, representing the period over which the Company satisfies the performance obligation. Transaction-based fees, which include services such as ATM usage fees, stop payment charges, statement rendering, are recognized at the time the transaction is executed as that is the point in time the Company fulfills the customer’s request. Service charges on deposits are withdrawn from the customer’s account balance. Substantially all of these revenues are recognized at the point in time the services are provided.
Other service charges and fees:
 The Company earns interchange income on its customers’ debit and credit card usage and earns fees from other services utilized by its customers. "Bankcard interchange income" is primarily comprised of interchange fees earned whenever the Company’s debit and credit cards are processed through card payment networks such as MasterCard. Interchange fees from cardholder transactions represent a percentage of the underlying transaction value and are recognized daily, concurrently with the transaction processing services provided to the cardholder. Interchange fees are offset with interchange expenses and are presented on a net basis. "Other service charges and fees" includes revenue from processing wire transfers, bill pay service, cashier’s checks, ATM surcharge fees, and other services. The Company’s performance obligation for fees, exchange, and other service charges are largely satisfied, and related revenue recognized, when the services are rendered or upon completion. Payment is typically received immediately or in the following month.  Substantially all of these revenues are recognized at the point in time the services are provided, with some recognized in the following month.
Commissions from the sale of financial products:
 The Company earns commissions from the sale of wealth management products.  Wealth management income primarily consists of commissions received on financial product sales, such as annuities. The Company’s performance obligation is generally satisfied upon the issuance of the financial product. Shortly after the policy is issued, the carrier remits the commission payment to the Company, and the Company recognizes the revenue. The Company also earns some fees from asset management, which is billed quarterly and due upon billing for services rendered in the most recent period, for which the performance obligation has been satisfied.  Substantially all of these revenues are recognized at the point in time that the services are provided.
Most contracts with customers are cancellable by either party without penalty or they are short-term in nature, with a contract duration of less than one year. Accordingly, most revenue deferred for the reporting period ended December 31, 2024 is expected to be earned within 
one year
.
The Company has made no significant judgments in applying the revenue guidance prescribed in ASC 606 that affect the determination of the amount and timing of revenue from the above-described contracts with customers.

Note 22. 
Segment Reporting
 The Company 
is a bank holding company, whose principal activity is the ownership and management of its wholly-owned subsidiary, First Bank (the "Bank").  As a community-oriented financial institution, substantially all of the Company’s operations involve the delivery of loan and deposit products or the provision of financial advice to customers.  Management makes operating decisions and assesses performance based on an ongoing review of these banking operations, which constitute the Company’s only operating segment for financial reporting purposes.  
The accounting policies of the banking operations segment are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. The measure of segment assets is reported on the balance sheet as total consolidated assets.
The role of chief operating decision maker is comprised of the executive leadership team to include the Company's Chief Executive Officer, the Bank's Chief Executive Officer, the Bank's President, the Company's Chief Financial Officer. The chief operating decision makers use pre-tax net income to allocate resources in the annual budget and forecasting process.  The chief operating decision makers consider budget-to-actual variances on a monthly basis for profit measures when making decisions about allocating capital and personnel to the operating segment.
The chief operating decision makers use the Consolidated Statements of Income and Consolidated Balance Sheets to ascertain measures or performance such as revenue, profit or loss, significant expenses and assets.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Shareholders and Board of Directors
First Bancorp
Southern Pines, North Carolina
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of First Bancorp (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024
,
 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) and our report dated February 26, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans
As described in Note 4 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements, the Company reported an allowance for credit losses on loans (“ACL”) of approximately $122.6 million as of December 31, 2024. As described in Note 1 to the Company's consolidated financial statements, the ACL represents management’s estimate of credit losses for the remaining estimated life of the loan portfolio using a quantitative lifetime loss model, which uses assumptions and data elements, some of which are subjective in nature. There is also a qualitative component of the ACL that is derived by applying qualitative risk scoring to a range of maximum and minimum loss rates for each of the identified qualitative factors. 
120
Table of Contents
Management makes significant judgments regarding selecting reasonable and supportable economic forecast factors used in the quantitative model and qualitative risk scores used in the qualitative component of the ACL.   We identified these economic forecast factors and qualitative risk scores as a critical audit matter because they involve especially subjective and complex judgement in auditing whether these were reasonable and supportable.  These assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment and increased extent of effort, specialized skills, and knowledge.  
The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:
•
Testing the design and operating effectiveness of the Company’s controls over the selected economic forecast factors and qualitative risk scores.   
•
Assessing the reasonableness of management’s judgments in determining the selected economic forecast factors and qualitative risks scores, including assessing the consistency of management’s application of its underlying framework for determining these assumptions and assessing for potential bias and potential contradictory evidence.  
•
Utilizing personnel with specialized skill and knowledge to assist with assessing the relevance and reliability of the data used in determining the selected economic forecast factors, including comparing the data to third-party sources.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
Shareholders and Board of Directors
First Bancorp
Southern Pines, North Carolina
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited First Bancorp’s (the “Company’s”) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the “COSO criteria”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria
. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated February 26, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9A, Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, which are our controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods.  Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed is communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Based on the evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in allowing timely decisions regarding disclosure to be made about material information required to be included in our periodic reports with the SEC.
Management’s Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.
Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting can also be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
Management is also responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this report. The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with GAAP and include, as necessary, best estimates and judgments by management.
Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013) (the "Framework"). Based on management’s evaluation under the Framework, management of the Company has concluded the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(f), as of December 31, 2024.
BDO USA, LLP, an independent, registered public accounting firm, has audited the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, and audited the Company’s effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, as stated in their reports, which are included in Item 8 hereof.
Changes in Internal Controls
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2024 that materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting
