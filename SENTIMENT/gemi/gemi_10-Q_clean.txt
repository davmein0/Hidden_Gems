b.
Registration Rights
. PubCo covenants and agrees as follows:
3
i.
Demand Registration
.
1.
Form S-1 Demand
. If PubCo is ineligible to file with the SEC a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (or successor form) in accordance with 
paragraphs b(i)(2)
, at any time after one hundred eighty (180) days after the date hereof, if PubCo receives a request from Holders of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the Registrable Securities then outstanding that PubCo file a Form S-1 registration statement with respect to Registrable Securities with an anticipated aggregate offering proceeds, net of Selling Expenses, that would exceed seventy-five million US dollars ($75,000,000), then PubCo shall: (x) within ten (10) days after the date such request is given, give notice thereof (the “
Demand Notice
”) to all Holders other than the Initiating Holders; and (y) as soon as practicable, and in any event within sixty (60) days after the date such request is given by the Initiating Holders, file a Form S-1 registration statement under the Securities Act covering all Registrable Securities that the Initiating Holders requested to be registered and any additional Registrable Securities requested to be included in such registration by any other Holders, as specified by notice given by each such Holder to PubCo within twenty (20) days of the date the Demand Notice is given, and in each case, subject to the limitations of 
paragraphs b(i)(3)
 and 
b(iii)
 of this Agreement.
2.
Form S-3 Demand
. If at any time when it is eligible to use a Form S-3 registration statement, PubCo receives a request from Holders of at least ten percent (10%) of the Registrable Securities then outstanding that PubCo file a Form S-3 registration statement with respect to outstanding Registrable Securities of such Holders having an anticipated aggregate offering proceeds, net of Selling Expenses, of at least seventy-five million US dollars ($75,000,000), then PubCo shall (i) within ten (10) days after the date such request is given, give a Demand Notice to all Holders other than the Initiating Holders; and (ii) as soon as practicable, and in any event within forty-five (45) days after the date such request is given by the Initiating Holders, file a Form S-3 registration statement under the Securities Act (or a post-effective amendment or prospectus supplement to an existing Form S-3 registration statement) covering all Registrable Securities requested to be included in such registration by any other Holders, as specified by notice given by each such Holder to PubCo within twenty (20) days of the date the Demand Notice is given, and in each case, subject to the limitations of 
paragraphs b(i)(3)
 and 
b(iii)
 of this Agreement. Such Form S-3 registration statement may also cover any other securities of PubCo and other Holders of PubCo’s securities.
3.
Blackout Periods
. Notwithstanding the foregoing obligations, if in the good faith judgment of the board of directors of PubCo it would be materially detrimental to PubCo and its shareholders for such registration statement to either become effective or remain effective for as long as such registration statement otherwise would be required to remain effective, or to commence an offering, 
4
because such action would: (i) materially interfere with a significant acquisition, corporate reorganization, or other similar transaction involving PubCo; (ii) require premature disclosure of material information that PubCo has a bona fide business purpose for preserving as confidential; or (iii) render PubCo unable to comply with requirements under the Securities Act or Exchange Act, then PubCo shall have the right to defer taking action with respect to such filing or offering, and any time periods with respect to filing or effectiveness thereof shall be tolled correspondingly, for a period of not more than ninety (90) days after the request of the Initiating Holders is given; 
provided
, 
however
, that PubCo may not invoke this right more than once in any twelve (12) month period; and 
provided
, 
further
 that PubCo shall not register any securities for its own account or that of any other equity holder during such ninety (90) day period other than in an Excluded Registration.
4.
Restrictions on Demand Registrations
. PubCo shall not be obligated to effect, or to take any action to effect, any registration or offering pursuant to 
paragraph b(i)(1)
 of this Agreement, (i) during the period that is sixty (60) days before PubCo’s good faith estimate of the date of filing of, and ending on a date that is one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of, a company-initiated registration; 
provided
 that PubCo is actively employing in good faith commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective; (ii) after PubCo has effected two (2) registrations pursuant to 
paragraph b(i)(1)
 of this Agreement
;
 or (iii) if the Initiating Holders propose to dispose of shares of Registrable Securities that may be immediately registered on Form S-3 pursuant to a request made pursuant to 
paragraph b(i)(2)
 of this Agreement. PubCo shall not be obligated to effect, or to take any action to effect, any registration or offering pursuant to 
paragraph b(i)(2)
 of this Agreement, (i) during the period that is thirty (30) days before PubCo’s good faith estimate of the date of filing of, and ending on a date that is ninety (90) days after the effective date of, a company-initiated registration; 
provided
 that PubCo is actively employing in good faith commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective; or (ii) if PubCo has effected two (2) registrations pursuant to 
paragraph b(i)(2)
 of this Agreement within the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the date of such request or more than four (4) registrations pursuant to 
paragraph b(i)(2)
 of this Agreement in the aggregate. A registration shall not be counted as “effected” for purposes of this 
paragraph b(i)(4)
 until such time as the applicable registration statement has been declared effective by the SEC, unless the Initiating Holders withdraw their request for such registration, elect not to pay the registration expenses therefor, and forfeit their right to one demand registration statement pursuant to 
paragraph b(vi)
 of this Agreement, in which case such withdrawn registration statement shall be counted as “effected” for purposes of this 
paragraph b(i)(4)
; 
provided
 that if such withdrawal is during a period PubCo has deferred taking action pursuant to 
paragraph b(i)(3)
 of this Agreement, then the Initiating Holders may withdraw their request for registration and 
5
such registration will not be counted as “effected” for purposes of this 
paragraph b(i)(4)
.
ii.
Company Registration
. If PubCo proposes to register (including for this purpose a registration effected by PubCo for stockholders other than the Holders) any of its common equity securities under the Securities Act in connection with the public offering of such securities solely for cash (other than in an Excluded Registration, a Block Trade or an at-the-market offering), PubCo shall, at such time, promptly give each Holder notice of such registration. Upon the request of each Holder given within ten (10) days after such notice is given by PubCo, PubCo shall, subject to the provisions of 
paragraph b(iii)
 of this Agreement
,
 cause to be registered all of the Registrable Securities that each such Holder has requested to be included in such registration. PubCo shall have the right to terminate or withdraw any registration initiated by it under this 
paragraph b(ii)
 before the effective date of such registration, whether or not any Holder has elected to include Registrable Securities in such registration. The expenses (other than Selling Expenses) of such withdrawn registration shall be borne by PubCo in accordance with 
paragraph b(vi)
 of this Agreement.
iii.
Underwriting Requirements
.
1.
If, pursuant to 
paragraph b(i)
 of this Agreement, the Initiating Holders intend to distribute the Registrable Securities covered by their request by means of an underwriting, they shall so advise PubCo as a part of their request made pursuant to 
paragraph b(i)
 of this Agreement, and PubCo shall include such information in the Demand Notice. The underwriter(s) will be selected by PubCo and shall be reasonably acceptable to a majority in interest of the Initiating Holders. In such event, the right of any Holder to include such Holder’s Registrable Securities in such registration shall be conditioned upon such Holder’s participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of such Holder’s Registrable Securities in the underwriting to the extent provided herein. All Holders proposing to distribute their securities through such underwriting shall (together with PubCo as provided in 
paragraph b(iv)(5)
 of this Agreement) enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the underwriter(s) selected for such underwriting; 
provided
, 
however
, that no Holder (or any of their assignees) shall be required to make any representations, warranties, or indemnities except as they relate to such Holder’s ownership of shares, the number of Registrable Securities it intends to sell, the name and address of such Holder, and authority to enter into the underwriting agreement and to such Holder’s intended method of distribution, and the liability of such Holder shall be several and not joint, and limited to an amount equal to the net proceeds from the offering received by such Holder. Notwithstanding any other provision of this 
paragraph b(iii)
, if the managing underwriter(s) advise(s) the Initiating Holders in writing that marketing factors require a limitation on the number of shares to be underwritten, then the Initiating Holders shall so advise all Holders of Registrable Securities that otherwise would be underwritten pursuant hereto, and the number of Registrable Securities that may be included in the underwriting shall be allocated among such Holders of 
6
Registrable Securities, including the Initiating Holders, in proportion (as nearly as practicable) to the number of Registrable Securities owned by each Holder or in such other proportion as shall be mutually agreed to by all such selling Holders; 
provided
, 
however
, that the number of Registrable Securities held by the Holders to be included in such underwriting shall not be reduced unless all other securities are first entirely excluded from the underwriting. 
2.
At any time and from time to time during the period a Form S-3 registration statement is effective, Holders of at least ten percent (10%) of the Registrable Securities then outstanding may, by written notice to PubCo, request an offering pursuant to the Form S-3 Registration Statement of all or part of the Registrable Securities held by such Holders (a “
Shelf Take-Down
”). Such Holders may, after any Form S-3 Registration Statement becomes effective, deliver a written notice to PubCo specifying that a Shelf Take-Down is intended to be conducted through an underwritten offering (including by means of a Block Trade) (such underwritten offering, an “
Underwritten Shelf Take-Down
”), which notice shall specify the number and type of Registrable Securities intended to be included in such Underwritten Shelf Take-Down and the intended method(s) of distribution thereof; 
provided
, 
however
, that the Holders may not request an Underwritten Shelf Take-Down the reasonably anticipated aggregate gross proceeds of which, net of Selling Expenses, are less than seventy-five million US dollars ($75,000,000). PubCo and Holders participating in an Underwritten Shelf Take-Down will enter into an underwriting agreement (including a customary lock-up, if requested by the managing underwriter(s) in customary form with the managing underwriter(s) selected for such offering). PubCo may include in any Underwritten Shelf Take-Down (other than a Block Trade) pursuant to this clause any additional securities of the same class, subject to the Holders’ priority position set forth herein. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if a Holder wishes to engage in a Shelf Take-Down in the form of a Block Trade, such Holder shall notify PubCo of the Block Trade not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the day such Block Trade is to commence, and Persons other than such demanding Holder shall not be entitled to make a demand for, receive notice of, or elect to participate in, such Block Trade. 
3.
In connection with any offering involving an underwriting of shares of PubCo’s capital stock pursuant to 
paragraph b(ii)
 hereof, PubCo shall not be required to include any of the Holders’ Registrable Securities in such underwriting unless the Holders accept the terms of the underwriting as agreed upon between PubCo and its underwriters, and then only in such quantity as the underwriters in their sole discretion determine will not jeopardize the success of the offering by PubCo. If the total number of securities, including Registrable Securities, requested by equity holders to be included in such offering exceeds the number of securities to be sold (other than by PubCo) that the underwriters in their reasonable discretion determine is compatible with the 
7
success of the offering, then PubCo shall be required to include in the offering only that number of such securities, including Registrable Securities, which the underwriters and PubCo in their sole discretion determine will not jeopardize the success of the offering. If the underwriters determine that less than all of the Registrable Securities requested to be registered can be included in such offering, then the Registrable Securities that are included in such offering shall be allocated among the selling Holders in proportion (as nearly as practicable to) the number of Registrable Securities owned by each selling Holder or in such other proportions as shall mutually be agreed to by all such selling Holders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall (a) the number of Registrable Securities included in the offering be reduced unless all other securities (other than securities to be sold by PubCo) are first entirely excluded from the offering or (b) the number of Registrable Securities included in the offering be reduced below twenty-five percent (25%) of the total number of securities included in such offering. For purposes of the provision in this 
paragraph b(iii)(3)
 concerning apportionment, for any selling Holder that is a partnership, limited liability company, or corporation, the partners, members, retired partners, retired members, stockholders, and Affiliates of such Holder, or the estates and immediate family members of any such partners, retired partners, members, and retired members and any trusts for the benefit of any of the foregoing Persons, shall be deemed to be a single “selling Holder,” and any pro rata reduction with respect to such “selling Holder” shall be based upon the aggregate number of Registrable Securities owned by all Persons included in such “selling Holder,” as defined in this sentence.
4.
For purposes of 
paragraph b(i)
 of this Agreement, a registration shall not be counted as “effected” if, as a result of an exercise of the underwriter’s cutback provisions in 
paragraph b(iii)(1)
 of this Agreement, fewer than fifty percent (50%) of the total number of Registrable Securities that Holders have requested to be included in such registration statement are actually included.
iv.
Obligations of PubCo
. Whenever required under this 
paragraph b
 to effect the registration of any Registrable Securities, PubCo shall, as expeditiously as reasonably possible:
1.
prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement with respect to such Registrable Securities and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective and, upon the request of the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities registered thereunder, keep such registration statement effective for a period of up to one hundred twenty (120) days or, if earlier, until the distribution contemplated in the registration statement has been completed; 
provided
, 
however
, that such one hundred twenty (120) day period shall be extended for a period of time equal to the period the Holder refrains, at the request of an underwriter of common equity (or other securities) of PubCo, from selling any securities included in such registration;
8
2.
prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to such registration statement, and the prospectus used in connection with such registration statement, as may be necessary to comply with the Securities Act in order to enable the disposition of all securities covered by such registration statement;
3.
furnish to the selling Holders such numbers of copies of a prospectus, including a preliminary prospectus, as required by the Securities Act, and such other documents as the Holders may reasonably request in order to facilitate their disposition of their Registrable Securities;
4.
use its commercially reasonable efforts to register and qualify the securities covered by such registration statement under such other securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as shall be reasonably requested by the selling Holders; 
provided
 that PubCo shall not be required to qualify to do business or to file a general consent to service of process in any such states or jurisdictions, unless PubCo is already subject to service in such jurisdiction and except as may be required by the Securities Act;
5.
in the event of any underwritten public offering, enter into and perform its obligations under an underwriting agreement, in usual and customary form, with the underwriter(s) of such offering;
6.
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all such Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement to be listed on a national securities exchange or trading system and each securities exchange and trading system (if any) on which similar securities issued by PubCo are then listed;
7.
provide a transfer agent and registrar for all Registrable Securities registered pursuant to this Agreement and provide a CUSIP number for all such Registrable Securities, in each case not later than the effective date of such registration;
8.
promptly make available for inspection by the selling Holders, any managing underwriter(s) participating in any disposition pursuant to such registration statement, and any attorney or accountant or other agent retained by any such underwriter or selected by the selling Holders, all financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents, and properties of PubCo, and cause PubCo’s officers, directors, employees, and independent accountants to supply all information reasonably requested by any such seller, underwriter, attorney, accountant, or agent, in each case, as necessary or advisable to verify the accuracy of the information in such registration statement and to conduct appropriate due diligence in connection therewith;
9.
notify each selling Holder, promptly after PubCo receives notice thereof, of the time when such registration statement has been declared effective or a supplement to any prospectus forming a part of such registration statement has been filed;
9
10.
after such registration statement becomes effective, notify each selling Holder of any request by the SEC that PubCo amend or supplement such registration statement or prospectus; and
11.
use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that, at all times after any registration statement covering a public offering of securities of PubCo under the Securities Act shall have become effective, its insider trading policy shall provide that PubCo’s directors may implement a trading program under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act.
v.
Furnish Information
. It shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of PubCo to take any action pursuant to this 
paragraph b
 with respect to the Registrable Securities of any selling Holder that such Holder shall furnish to PubCo such information regarding itself, the Registrable Securities held by it, and the intended method of disposition of such securities as is reasonably required to effect the registration of such Holder’s Registrable Securities.
vi.
Expenses of Registration
. All expenses (other than Selling Expenses) incurred in connection with registrations, filings, or qualifications pursuant to 
paragraph b
, including all registration, filing, and qualification fees; printers’ and accounting fees; fees and disbursements; and the reasonable fees and disbursements of one counsel for the selling Holders selected by Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities to be registered (“
Selling Holder Counsel
”), shall be borne and paid by PubCo; 
provided
, 
however
, that PubCo shall not be required to pay for any expenses of any registration proceeding begun pursuant to 
paragraph b(i)
 of this Agreement if the registration request is subsequently withdrawn at the request of the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities to be registered (in which case all selling Holders shall bear such expenses pro rata based upon the number of Registrable Securities that were to be included in the withdrawn registration), unless the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities agree to forfeit their right to one registration pursuant to 
paragraph b(i)(1)
 or 
paragraph b(i)(2)
 of this Agreement, as the case may be; 
provided
, 
further
, that if, at the time of such withdrawal, the Holders shall have learned of a material adverse change in the condition, business, or prospects of PubCo from that known to the Holders at the time of their request and have withdrawn the request with reasonable promptness after learning of such information then the Holders shall not be required to pay any of such expenses and shall not forfeit their right to one registration pursuant to 
paragraph b(i)(1)
 or 
paragraph b(i)(2)
 of this Agreement
.
 All Selling Expenses relating to Registrable Securities registered pursuant to this 
paragraph b
 (other than fees and disbursements of counsel to any Holder, other than the Selling Holder Counsel, which shall be borne solely by the Holder engaging such counsel) shall be borne and paid by the Holders

pro rata on the basis of the number of Registrable Securities registered on their behalf.
vii.
Delay of Registration
. No Holder shall have any right to obtain or seek an injunction restraining or otherwise delaying any registration pursuant to this Agreement as the result of any controversy that might arise with respect to the interpretation or implementation of this 
paragraph b.
10
viii.
Indemnification
. If any Registrable Securities are included in a registration statement under this 
paragraph b
:
1.
To the extent permitted by law, PubCo will indemnify and hold harmless each selling Holder, and the partners, members, officers, directors, and stockholders of each such Holder; legal counsel and accountants for each such Holder; any underwriter (as defined in the Securities Act) for each such Holder; and each Person, if any, who controls such Holder or underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, against any Damages, and PubCo will pay to each such Holder, underwriter, controlling Person, or other aforementioned Person any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred thereby in connection with investigating or defending any claim or proceeding from which Damages may result, as such expenses are incurred; 
provided
, 
however
, that the indemnity agreement contained in this 
paragraph b(viii)(1)
 shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such claim or proceeding if such settlement is effected without the consent of PubCo, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, nor shall PubCo be liable for any Damages to the extent that they arise out of or are based upon actions or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by or on behalf of any such Holder, underwriter, controlling Person, or other aforementioned Person expressly for use in connection with such registration except to the extent such information has been corrected in a subsequent writing prior to or concurrently with the sale of Registrable Securities to the Person asserting the claim.
2.
To the extent permitted by law, each selling Holder, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless PubCo, and each of its directors, each of its officers who has signed the registration statement, each Person (if any), who controls PubCo within the meaning of the Securities Act, legal counsel and accountants for PubCo, any underwriter (as defined in the Securities Act), any other Holder selling securities in such registration statement, and any controlling Person of any such underwriter or other Holder, against any Damages, in each case only to the extent that such Damages arise out of or are based upon actions or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by or on behalf of such selling Holder expressly for use in connection with such registration and has not been corrected in a subsequent writing prior to or concurrently with the sale of Registrable Securities to the Person asserting the claim; and each such selling Holder will pay to PubCo and each other aforementioned Person any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred thereby in connection with investigating or defending any claim or proceeding from which Damages may result, as such expenses are incurred; 
provided
, 
however
, that the indemnity agreement contained in this 
paragraph b(viii)(2)
 shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such claim or proceeding if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Holder, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; and 
provided
, further, that in no event shall the aggregate amounts payable by any Holder by way of indemnity or contribution under this 
paragraph b(viii)(2)

11
and 
paragraph b(viii)(4)
 of this Agreement exceed the proceeds from the offering received by such Holder (net of any Selling Expenses paid by such Holder), except in the case of fraud or willful misconduct by such Holder.
3.
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this 
paragraph b(viii)
 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action) for which a party may be entitled to indemnification hereunder, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this 
paragraph b(viii)
, give the indemnifying party notice of the commencement thereof. The indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in such action and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, participate jointly with any other indemnifying party to which notice has been given, and to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties; 
provided
, 
however
, that an indemnified party (together with all other indemnified parties that may be represented without conflict by one counsel) shall have the right to retain one separate counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such action. The failure to give notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action shall relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnified party under this 
paragraph b(viii)
, solely to the extent that such failure materially prejudices the indemnifying party’s ability to defend such action. The failure to give notice to the indemnifying party will not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this 
paragraph b(viii)

To provide for just and equitable contribution to joint liability under the Securities Act in any case in which either: (A) any party otherwise entitled to indemnification hereunder makes a claim for indemnification pursuant to this 
paragraph b(viii)
 but it is judicially determined (by the entry of a final judgment or decree by a court of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of time to appeal or the denial of the last right of appeal) that such indemnification may not be enforced in such case, notwithstanding the fact that this 
paragraph b(viii)
 provides for indemnification in such case, or (B) contribution under the Securities Act may be required on the part of any party hereto for which indemnification is provided under this 
paragraph b(viii)
, then, and in each such case, such parties will contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages, liabilities, or expenses to which they may be subject (after contribution from others) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of each of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in connection with the statements, omissions, or other actions that resulted in such loss, claim, damage, liability, or expense, as well as to reflect any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among 
12
other things, whether the untrue or allegedly untrue statement of a material fact, or the omission or alleged omission of a material fact, relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission; 
provided
, 
however
, that, in any such case (x) no Holder will be required to contribute any amount in excess of the aggregate proceeds of all such Registrable Securities offered and sold by such Holder pursuant to such registration statement, and (y) no Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation; and 
provided
, 
further
, that in no event shall a Holder’s liability pursuant to this 
paragraph b(viii)(4)
, when combined with the amounts paid or payable by such Holder pursuant to 
paragraph b(viii)(2)
 of this Agreement, exceed the proceeds from the offering received by such Holder (net of any Selling Expenses paid by such Holder), except in the case of willful misconduct or fraud by such Holder.
5.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the provisions on indemnification and contribution contained in the underwriting agreement entered into in connection with the underwritten public offering are in conflict with the foregoing provisions, the provisions in the underwriting agreement shall control; 
provided
, 
however
, that any matter expressly provided for or addressed by the foregoing provisions that is not expressly provided for or addressed by the underwriting agreement shall be controlled by the foregoing provisions.
6.
Unless otherwise superseded by an underwriting agreement entered into in connection with the underwritten public offering, the obligations of PubCo and Holders under this 
paragraph b(viii)
 shall survive the completion of any offering of Registrable Securities in a registration under this 
paragraph b
, and otherwise shall survive the termination of this Agreement or any provision(s) of this Agreement.
ix.
Reports Under Exchange Act
. With a view to making available to the Holders the benefits of SEC Rule 144 and any other rule or regulation of the SEC that may at any time permit a Holder to sell securities of PubCo to the public without registration or pursuant to a registration on Form S-3, PubCo shall:
1.
make and keep available adequate current public information, as those terms are understood and defined in SEC Rule 144;
2.
use commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of PubCo under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act; and furnish to any Holder, so long as the Holder owns any Registrable Securities, forthwith upon request (x) to the extent accurate, a written statement by PubCo that it has complied with the reporting 
13
requirements of SEC Rule 144 (at any time after ninety (90) days after the date hereof), the Securities Act, and the Exchange Act, or that it qualifies as a registrant whose securities may be resold pursuant to Form S-3 (at any time after PubCo so qualifies); and (y) such other information as may be reasonably requested in availing any Holder of any rule or regulation of the SEC that permits the selling of any such securities without registration or pursuant to Form S-3 (at any time after PubCo so qualifies to use such form).
x.
Termination of Registration Rights
. The rights of any Holder under this Agreement, including to request registration or inclusion of Registrable Securities in any registration pursuant to 
paragraph b(i)
 or 
paragraph b(ii)
 of this Agreement, shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of:
1.
the closing of a Deemed Liquidation Event;
2.
such time as SEC Rule 144 or another similar exemption under the Securities Act is available for the sale of all of such Holder’s shares without limitation, during a three (3) month period without registration; or
3.
the fifth (5th) anniversary of the date hereof.
xi.
Subsequent Registration Rights
. From and after the date of this Agreement, PubCo shall not, without the prior written consent of the holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities then outstanding, enter into any agreement with any holder or prospective holder of any securities of PubCo that would provide to such holder or prospective holder the right to include securities in any registration on other than either a pro rata basis with respect to the Registrable Securities or on a subordinate basis after all Holders have had the opportunity to include in the registration and offering all shares of Registrable Securities that they wish to so include; 
provided
 that this limitation shall not apply to Registrable Securities acquired by (a) any existing or new stockholder that holds Common Stock equal to at least ten percent (10%) of the aggregate amount of issued and outstanding Common Stock, or (b) Morgan Creek Gemini SPV, Inc. and its Affiliates (“
MCD
”) for so long as it holds at least fifty percent (50%) of the Series B Preferred Units of Gemini Space Station, LLC (on an as-converted basis) originally purchased by MCD (subject to adjustment for unit splits, recapitalizations and the like).
xii.

This Agreement, together with the other documents and agreements referred to herein, is the entire, final, and complete agreement and understanding of the parties hereto relating to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and replaces all prior and contemporaneous agreements and understandings, whether written and oral, by and among the parties or their representatives with respect thereto.

xix.
Severability
. If any provision of this Agreement is determined by a court to be invalid or unenforceable, that determination will not affect the other provisions hereof, each of which will be construed and enforced as if the invalid or unenforceable portion were not contained herein solely to the extent of such invalidity of unenforceability. Such invalidity or unenforceability will not affect any valid and enforceable application thereof, and each such provision will be deemed to be effective, operative, made, entered into, or taken in the manner and to the full extent permitted by law.

Successors and Assigns.
 Subject to the prior written consent of PubCo, a Holder may transfer or assign all or any portion of their respective rights provided in this Agreement in connection with the transfer of shares of Class A Common Stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Class A Common Stock.

Additional Holder
”) by obtaining an executed joinder agreement from such Additional Holder in a form reasonably satisfactory to PubCo.
