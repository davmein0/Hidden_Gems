PART I    

        This annual report is prepared on Form 10-K and is filed by FirstService Corporation, an Ontario company (hereinafter sometimes referred
to as the "Registrant"). The Registrant and its subsidiaries are referred to as "FirstService", the "Company", "us", "our" or "we", except as expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise
requires. The Registrant is a "foreign private issuer" as defined under Rule 405 of Regulation C under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. However, commencing with the year ended
March 31, 2000, the Registrant elected to file its annual, quarterly and current reports on forms designated for U.S. domestic issuers. 

Forward-looking statements  

        This annual report on Form 10-K contains or incorporates by reference certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors created by such legislation. Such forward-looking statements involve risks and
uncertainties and include, but are not limited to, statements regarding future events and the Company's plans, goals and objectives. Such statements are generally accompanied by words such as
"intend", "anticipate", "believe", "estimate", "expect" or similar statements. Our actual results may differ materially from such statements. Factors that could result in such differences, among
others, are: 

•
Political
conditions, including any outbreak or escalation of terrorism or hostilities and the impact thereof on our business.

•
U.
S. and Canadian economic conditions, especially as they relate to consumer spending and business spending on customer relations and promotion.

•
Extreme
weather conditions impacting demand for our services or our ability to perform those services.

•
Competition
in the markets served by the Company.

•
Labor
shortages or increases in wage rates.

•
The
effects of changes in interest rates on our cost of borrowing.

•
Unexpected
increases in operating costs, such as insurance, workers' compensation, health care and fuel prices.

•
Changes
in government policies at the federal, state/provincial or local level that may adversely impact our firearms registration processing, lawn care, or textbook
fulfillment activities.

•
The
effects of changes in the Canadian dollar foreign exchange rate in relation to the U.S. dollar on the Company's Canadian dollar denominated revenues and expenses.

•
Our
ability to make acquisitions at reasonable prices and successfully integrate acquired operations. 

        Although
we believe that the assumptions underlying our forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove inaccurate and, therefore, there can be no assurance
that the results contemplated in such forward-looking statements will be realized. The inclusion of such forward-looking statements should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any
other person that the future events, plans or expectations contemplated by the Company will be achieved. We note that past performance in operations and share price are not necessarily predictive of
future performance.
