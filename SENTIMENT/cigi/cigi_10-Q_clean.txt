FIRSTSERVICE CORPORATION    

    NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    

    December 31, 2003
  (Unaudited)
  (in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)

1. DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS  

        FirstService
Corporation (the "Company") is a provider of property and business services to commercial, residential and institutional customers in the United States and Canada.
The Company's operations are conducted through four segments: Residential Property Management, Integrated Security Services, Consumer Services and Business Services. 

2. SUMMARY OF PRESENTATION  

        The
condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC") for the presentation of interim financial information. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make
the information not misleading. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

        In
the opinion of management, the condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position of the Company as of
December 31, 2003, the results of its operations for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 and cash flows for the nine-month periods ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The results of operations for the nine months ended December 31, 2003 are not necessarily indicative of
the results to be expected for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2004. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto for the fiscal year ended
March 31, 2003 contained in the Company's Form 10-K/A as filed with the SEC. 

3. RESTATEMENTS  

        As
a result of a detailed review of the accounting for certain intangible assets, including purchase accounting at the times of acquisition and accounting upon the adoption of Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, 
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
, at April 1, 2001, the Company has made certain
restatements. In particular, the Company recorded deferred income taxes with respect to franchise intangible assets acquired upon the October 1998 acquisition of California Closet
Company, Inc. ("CCC") and the October 1997 acquisition of Paul Davis Restoration, Inc. ("PDR"). In addition, the Company reevaluated the useful lives of the franchise intangible
assets associated with CCC and PDR. It was determined that the amortization of franchise rights should follow the pattern of use, specifically the attrition rate of the franchisees that were present
at the dates of acquisition. The amortization of trademarks and trade names was determined to be 35 and 25 years for CCC and PDR, respectively. Previously, all of these assets were treated as
indefinite life intangible assets. 

        The
following presents the impact on net earnings of the restatement adjustments for the three and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2002.

        The
consolidated balance sheet as at March 31, 2003 was restated. The recognition of deferred income taxes related to the CCC and PDR franchise intangible assets resulted in an
increase to goodwill and an increase to deferred income taxes long-term liability. In addition, the balance sheets were restated to take into account the amortization expense, income tax
recovery, minority interest, and effect on retained earnings resulting from the restatement adjustments to net earnings described in the chart above. A reconciliation of the consolidated balance sheet
at March 31, 2003 follows.

4. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  

        In
April 2003, SFAS No. 149, 
Amendment of SFAS 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

("SFAS 149") was issued. SFAS 149 amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts
and for hedging activities under SFAS 133, 
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
 ("SFAS 133"). SFAS 149 is
effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003 and hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. SFAS 149 did not have a material impact on the
Company's financial condition or results of operations. 

        In
May 2003, SFAS No. 150, 
Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity
 ("SFAS 150") was issued. SFAS 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of
both liabilities and equity, and is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003 and otherwise is effective July 1, 2003. SFAS 150 had no impact
on the Company's financial condition or results of operations. 

        In
February 2003, FASB Interpretation No. 46, 
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (an interpretation of ARB
No. 51)
 ("FIN 46") was issued. In December 2003, FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003) ("FIN 46R").
FIN 46R addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities having certain characteristics and replaces FIN 46. FIN 46R is effective for the Company's
annual financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2004. The Company is evaluating the impact of FIN 46R on its results of operations and financial condition. 

5. ACQUISITIONS OF BUSINESSES AND PURCHASES OF MINORITY INTERESTS  

        During
the nine-month period, four businesses were acquired in the Company's Consumer Services segment at a cost of $13,794 ($13,451 net of cash acquired). The purchase
prices were allocated as follows: goodwill $9,556; intangible assets $7,387; other net assets $(3,492). During the prior year period, four business acquisitions in the amount of $2,880 ($2,405 net of
cash acquired) were completed. 

        Certain
vendors, at the time of acquisition, are entitled to receive contingent consideration if the acquired businesses achieve specified earnings levels during the
two — to four-year periods following the dates of acquisition. Such contingent consideration is issued at the expiration of the contingency period. As
at December 31, 2003, there was contingent consideration outstanding of up to $16,500 ($12,700 as at March 31, 2003). The contingencies will expire during the period extending to
April 2007. Vendors are entitled to receive interest on contingent consideration issued to them, which interest is calculated from the acquisition date to the payment date at interest rates
ranging from 5% to 7%. The contingent consideration will be recorded when the contingencies are resolved and the consideration is issued or becomes issuable, at which time the Company will record the
fair value of the consideration issued or issuable, including interest, as additional costs of the acquired businesses. There was $1,478 of contingent consideration issued or issuable during the
nine-month period (2002 — $2,991) and allocated to goodwill. 

        During
the nine months ended December 31, 2003, the Company purchased minority interests from one (2002 — five) minority shareholder(s) for
total consideration of $940 (2002 — $4,204). The purchase price for the 2003 purchase was allocated as follows: minority interest $656 and goodwill $284. 

6. LONG-TERM DEBT  

        The
Company has an amended and restated credit agreement with a syndicate of banks that provides a $90,000 committed senior revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facility") renewable
and extendible in 364-day increments, and if not renewed, a two-year final maturity. The Credit Facility was most recently renewed and extended on May 7, 2003. The
Credit Facility bears interest at 1.5% to 3.0% over floating reference rates, depending on certain leverage ratios. At December 31, 2003, the Company had drawn $4,500 on the Credit Facility and
had letters of credit of $5,730 outstanding. 

        The
Company has outstanding $100,000 of 8.06% fixed-rate Senior Secured Notes (the "8.06% Notes"), held by a group of U.S. institutional investors. The final maturity
of the 8.06% Notes is June 29, 2011, with equal annual principal repayments commencing on June 29, 2005. 

9

        On
October 1, 2003, the Company issued $50,000 of 6.40% fixed-rate Senior Secured Notes (the "6.40% Notes") to a group of U.S. institutional investors. The
6.40% Notes have a final maturity of September 30, 2015 with equal annual principal repayments commencing on September 30, 2012. The proceeds of the 6.40% Notes were used to repay
amounts drawn on the Credit Facility. Concurrent with the issuance of the 6.40% Notes, the Company's Credit Facility was reduced to $90,000 from $140,000 resulting in no net change to the Company's
overall borrowing capacity. 

        The
Credit Facility and the Notes rank equally in terms of seniority. The Company has granted the lenders and Note-holders various security including the following: an
interest in all of the assets of the Company including the Company's share of its subsidiaries, an assignment of material contracts and an assignment of the Company's "call rights" with respect to
shares of the subsidiaries held by minority interests. 

        The
covenants and other limitations within the amended and restated credit agreement and the Note agreements are substantially the same. The covenants require the Company to maintain
certain ratios including leverage, fixed charge coverage, interest coverage and net worth. The Company is limited from undertaking certain mergers, acquisitions and dispositions without prior
approval. 

7. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  

        The
Company has interest rate swap agreements to exchange the fixed rates on the Notes for variable rates. On the 8.06% Notes, one interest rate swap exchanges the fixed rate on $75,000
of principal for LIBOR + 250.5 basis points and a second exchanges the fixed rate on $25,000 for LIBOR + 445 basis points. The terms of the swaps match the term of the
Notes with a maturity of June 29, 2011. On October 2, 2003, the Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements to exchange the fixed rate on the $50 million in 6.40% Notes
for a variable rate of LIBOR + 170 basis points. The terms of the swaps match the term of the 6.40% Notes with a maturity of September 30, 2015. 

        The
interest rate swaps are being accounted for as fair value hedges in accordance with SFAS 133. The swaps are carried at fair value on the balance sheet, with gains or losses
recognized in earnings. The carrying value of the hedged debt is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the hedged interest rate risk; the associated gain or loss is recognized currently
in earnings. So long as the hedge is considered highly effective, the net impact on earnings is nil. The fair value of the swaps is determined based on the present value of the estimated future net
cash flows using implied rates in the applicable yield curve as of the valuation date. Due to changes in the yield curve, the fair values of the swaps fluctuate and at December 31, 2003, the
fair values were a gain of $3,161 (2002 — gain of $6,279). 

        The
Company from time to time purchases and sells foreign currencies by using forward contracts, which have not been specifically identified as hedges. The values of these contracts are
marked to market with resulting gains and losses included in earnings. At December 31, 2003 the Company had outstanding 4 foreign currency contracts to purchase $Cdn10,817 at a rate of
$Cdn1.3522 per $US1.0000 on various dates during the period from March 2004 to December 2004, the fair value of which represented a gain of $Cdn350 ($US270). The purpose of the contracts
is to match expected future Canadian dollar denominated expenses at the Canadian Business Services operations to U.S. dollar denominated revenues.

9. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  

        The
Company has a stock option plan for officers, key full-time employees and directors of the Company and its subsidiaries. Options are granted at the market price for the
underlying shares on the date of grant. Each option vests over a four-year period and expires five years from the date granted and allows for the purchase of one Subordinate Voting Share. 

        In
December 2002, SFAS No. 148, 
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and Disclosure an
Amendment of SFAS 123
 ("SFAS 148") was issued. SFAS 148 provides alternative methods of transition for making a voluntary change to fair value-based
accounting for stock-based compensation. The Company continues to account for its stock option plans under the intrinsic value recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25, 

Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees
 ("APB 25"), and related interpretations. Effective for interim periods beginning after
December 15, 2002, SFAS 148 also requires disclosure of pro forma results on a quarterly basis as if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of
SFAS No. 123, 
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
 ("SFAS 123"). 

        In
accordance with APB 25, no stock-based employee compensation cost has been recognized in earnings. The following table illustrates the effect on net earnings and earnings per
share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, as amended, to all options outstanding under the Company's stock option plan.

        During
the nine-month period ended December 31, 2003, the Company granted 37,000 stock options that call for settlement by the issuance of Subordinate Voting Shares at
a weighted average exercise price of $12.00 per share with an estimated fair value of $4.03 per share (2002 — 34,000 stock options at a weighted average exercise
price of $22.04 per share and an estimated fair value of $7.64 per share). The value of these option grants was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes pricing model with the following

        The
Company is involved in legal proceedings and claims primarily arising in the normal course of its business. In the opinion of management, the Company's liability, if any, would not
materially affect its results of operations or financial condition. 

11. GUARANTEE  

        In
connection with a contract, the Company has assumed risks associated with work to be performed by a third party. In the unlikely event of non-performance by the third
party, the maximum exposure to the Company would be $7,713.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

(in U.S. Dollars) 

Results of operations — three months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002  

        Revenues for our third quarter of fiscal 2004 were $152.1 million, 20% higher than the prior year's quarter. Internal growth was 9%, while changes in
foreign exchange rates and acquisitions contributed 6% and 5%, respectively. 

        During
the quarter, 31% of our revenues were originally denominated in Canadian currency, and the balance in U.S. dollars. Based on average foreign exchange rates, the Canadian
dollar was 19.3% stronger relative to the U.S. dollar during the quarter than in the comparable quarter last year. The Company's Canadian dollar denominated revenues and earnings benefit from a
stronger Canadian dollar upon conversion to U.S. dollars. This is offset by exchange losses incurred by certain Business Services operations based in Canada that sell services to
U.S. clients in U.S. dollars. If exchange rates had stayed constant year-over-year, the current year's second quarter revenues would have been $7.6 million
lower and EBITDA
(1)
 would have been $0.1 million higher. 

(1)
EBITDA
is defined as net earnings before extraordinary items, minority interest share of earnings, income taxes, interest, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA excludes income taxes
and interest, both of which are charges that require cash settlement. EBITDA is not a recognized measure for financial statement presentation under United States generally accepted accounting
principles ("U.S. GAAP"). The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure is operating earnings. Operating earnings takes into account depreciation and amortization expenses, while EBITDA does not.
Management utilizes EBITDA as a measure to assess the performance of its operations, to evaluate acquisition candidates and establish pricing, for performance-based compensation purposes, and within
its debt covenants with its lenders. The Company believes EBITDA is a reasonable measure of operating performance because of the low capital intensity of its service operations. The Company believes
EBITDA is a financial metric used by many investors to compare companies, especially in the services industry, on the basis of operating results and the ability to incur and service debt. The table
below reconciles EBITDA to operating earnings.

        Third quarter EBITDA was $9.5 million, 16% higher than the $8.2 million reported in the prior year quarter. Our EBITDA margin was
6.2% of revenues versus 6.5% of revenues because of higher corporate costs and foreign exchange in Business Services (higher revenues without corresponding EBITDA). Operating earnings for the quarter
were $5.3 million, up from $4.6 million in the prior year due to higher revenues offset by higher depreciation and amortization expenses. 

        Interest
expense was $2.0 million versus $2.1 million recorded in the prior year quarter. The average interest rate during the quarter was 5.3%, approximately 20 basis
points higher than last year's quarter. We continued to benefit from low floating reference rates during the quarter. Substantially all of our indebtedness was at variable interest rates during the
quarter. We monitor interest rates closely and we intend to fix a portion of our debt if economic indicators warrant. 

        The
consolidated income tax rate declined to approximately 29.8% of earnings before income taxes and minority interest from 32.4% in the prior year's quarter. The reduction in tax rate
is primarily the result of efficiencies generated from the cross-border tax structure we implemented in fiscal 2000. 

        Net
earnings for the quarter were $2.0 million, compared to $1.3 million in the prior year quarter, as a result of higher operating earnings from each business segment. 

        Our
Residential Property Management segment reported revenues of $54.9 million for the quarter, up $8.1 million or 17% versus the prior year quarter. Internal growth in
core contractual management revenues was 11%, and an additional 6% of growth came from acquisitions completed during the last twelve months. Residential Property Management EBITDA was
$2.2 million, up slightly relative to the prior year quarter. Margins declined due to underperformance in our restoration operations and slightly higher insurance costs. Foreign exchange rates
did not impact revenue or EBITDA growth. 

        The
revenues of our Integrated Security Services segment rose 15% to $32.6 million. Internal growth was 5%, while foreign exchange on our Canadian operations accounted for the
balance of the revenue increase. Integrated Security Services EBITDA was $2.6 million, an increase of 22% over the $2.1 million reported one year ago, and margins improved 50 basis
points to 7.9%. The margin improvement was the result of higher gross profit margins on systems installations. 

        Consumer
Services revenues were $27.5 million, an increase of 44% over the prior year period. Internal growth represented 22% of the revenue gain, while acquisitions accounted for
17% and foreign exchange accounted for 5%. EBITDA at Consumer Services was $2.6 million compared to $1.3 million reported in the prior year period. Approximately half of the EBITDA
increase was from acquisitions. 

        Third
quarter revenues in Business Services were $37.0 million, an increase of 14% over the fiscal 2003 period. Internal growth accounted for 3% of the revenue increase, while
foreign exchange represented the balance. Business Services EBITDA was $3.9 million, up slightly from the $3.7 million reported one year ago. Under-utilization of fulfillment warehouse
capacity continued to negatively impact the quarter's margins, but new client wins have slowly begun to increase our utilization, and this is expected to continue. Foreign exchange, while causing
reported revenues to increase, had only a nominal impact on EBITDA because margins at our Canadian operations that sell services to U.S. clients in U.S. dollars contracted. 

        Corporate
expenses for the quarter totaled $1.8 million. The $0.8 million increase relative to the prior year was due to foreign exchange of $0.3 million (most
Corporate costs are denominated in Canadian dollars) and to increased compensation expense. 

Results of operations — nine months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002  

        Revenues for the nine-month period were $476.4 million, 14% higher than revenues reported in the same period one year ago. Internal growth
accounted for 6% of the revenue increase, while acquisitions and changes in foreign exchange rates each accounted for 4% of the increase. 

        During
the nine-month period, 30% of our revenues were originally denominated in Canadian currency, and the balance in U.S. dollars. Based on the average foreign
exchange rates in effect during the period, the Canadian dollar was 14.4% stronger relative to the U.S. dollar during the period than in the comparable period last year. The Company's Canadian
dollar denominated revenues and earnings benefit from a stronger Canadian dollar upon conversion to U.S. dollars. This is offset by exchange losses incurred by certain Business Services
operations based in Canada that sell services to U.S. clients in U.S. dollars. If exchange rates had stayed constant year-over-year, the current year period's
revenues would have been $18.2 million lower and EBITDA would have been $0.2 million higher. 

        For
the nine months ended December 31, 2003, EBITDA was $48.0 million, up $0.1 million versus the prior year period. The flat comparison was the result of lower
profitability in the first quarter, especially in the Business Services segment, offset by improving results in the second and third quarters. Operating earnings were $35.7 million, down
$1.6 million versus the prior year entirely due to higher depreciation and amortization expense primarily from fixed and intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions. 

        Net
earnings for the nine-month period were $17.4 million, identical to the comparable period. Net earnings was flat despite the reduction in operating earnings
because of lower interest expense due to lower floating interest rates and a decline in our income tax rate. 

        Residential
Property Management reported year-to-date revenues of $183.8 million, reflecting growth of 12% relative to the prior year. Internal growth was
8%, with the balance attributable to acquisitions. Revenue growth came from core property management client wins and ancillary services. EBITDA was $14.9 million, up from $14.0 million
in the prior year period. 

        Integrated
Security Services revenues for the nine-month period were $92.3 million, up 14% versus the prior year. Approximately 7% of the revenue increase was a result
of internal growth in our US operations, while the balance of the increase related to changes in foreign exchange rates. EBITDA was $6.8 million, up from $6.2 million in the prior year
period, while the margin declined slightly to 7.4%. 

        Consumer
Services revenues were $93.8 million, up 23% relative to the prior year period. Internal growth for the period was 13%, acquisitions contributed 5% and foreign exchange
rate changes also contributed 5%. EBITDA was $18.3 million, up 11% from $16.5 million, while margins declined from 21.6% in last year's period to 19.6% this year. The margin decline was
revenue mix related, since Company-owned operations, such as recently-acquired branchises, contribute lower margins and do not have a seasonal peak in the first half of the year. 

        Business
Services reported year-to-date revenues of $106.2 million, an increase of 10% relative to last year. Foreign exchange accounted for 8% of the
increase, while internal growth represented 2%. While revenues contracted early in the year, production started on several new clients in the second quarter to effect the year to date increase. EBITDA
was $12.5 million versus $14.6 million reported one year ago, due to excess fulfillment capacity and lower margins on new business. Capacity utilization and corresponding margins are
expected to increase slowly over the next few quarters. 

        Our
corporate costs were $4.9 million for the nine months, $1.5 million higher than in the prior period, primarily as a result of foreign exchange impact of
$0.6 million (a majority of corporate costs are denominated in Canadian dollars) but also due to an executive severance in the first quarter and higher compensation costs. 

Restatements  

        On January 27, 2004, we announced that as a result of a detailed review of the accounting for certain intangible assets, including purchase accounting at
the times of acquisition and accounting upon the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, 
Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets
, at April 1, 2001, certain restatements would be made. In particular, we recorded deferred income taxes with respect to franchise intangible assets acquired upon
the October 1998 acquisition of California Closet Company, Inc. ("CCC") and the October 1997 acquisition of Paul Davis Restoration, Inc. ("PDR"). In addition, we
reevaluated the estimated useful lives of the franchise intangible assets associated with CCC and PDR. It was determined that the amortization of franchise rights should follow the pattern of use,
specifically the attrition rate of the franchisees that were present at the dates of acquisition. The amortization of trademarks and trade names was determined to be 35 and 25 years for CCC and
PDR, respectively. Previously, all of these assets were treated as indefinite life intangible assets. 

        On
February 11, 2004, we filed an amended Form 10-K/A for the year ended March 31, 2003 and amended Forms 10-Q/A for the
quarters ended June 30, 2003 and September 30, 2003 to reflect the restatements. The cumulative impact of the restatements upon retained earnings to September 30, 2003 was
$1.2 million. On an annual basis, the impact upon net earnings for each of the years ended March 31, 2003 and 2002 was $0.4 million comprised of additional
amortization expense of $0.8 million less income tax and minority interest effects of $0.4 million. The annual impact on diluted earnings per share for each of these years was $0.03. 

Acquisitions  

        In October 2003, we completed four acquisitions in our Consumer Services segment. Two acquisitions are California Closets franchises (San Francisco and
Toronto) that became our fifth and six Company-owned "branchises". In addition, we acquired two franchise systems — Pillar to Post, Inc. ("PTP") and Floor
Coverings International, Inc. ("FCI"). PTP is one of the largest franchised home inspection services in North America, with 300 franchisees and approximately $30 million in annual
system-wide sales. FCI franchises mobile shop-at-home floor coverings businesses with 100 franchisees and annual system-wide sales of
$20 million. The four acquisitions collectively generated approximately $10 million in revenues and $1.8 million in EBITDA in their most recent fiscal years prior to acquisition. 

Outlook  

        The outlook presented on October 21, 2003 with our second quarter results for fiscal 2004 was: revenues $590-$600 million; EBITDA
$54.5-$56.0 million; operating earnings $39.5-$41.0 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.27-$1.32. This outlook has been updated to take our
results for the third quarter into consideration and to reflect the impact of the restatements. The updated outlook is as follows: revenues $610-$620 million; EBITDA
$55.0-$56.0 million; and diluted earnings per share of $1.27-$1.30. 

        The
Company also presented a preliminary outlook for the year ended March 31, 2005, which may be updated once our internal budgeting process is completed, which is expected to be
before the end of March 2004. The preliminary outlook is: revenues $650-675 million; EBITDA $60.5-$63.0 million; and diluted earnings per share of
$1.40-$1.50. The preliminary outlook takes into account the impact of amortization resulting from the restatements, an average foreign exchange rate of $US0.7800 per $Cdn1.0000, no change
in interest rates, and no new acquisitions. 

Seasonality and quarterly fluctuations  

        Certain segments of the Company's operations, which in the aggregate comprise approximately 15% of revenues, are subject to seasonal variations. Specifically, the
demand for residential lawn care, exterior painting, and swimming pool management in the northern United States and Canada is highest during late spring, summer and early fall and very low
during winter. As a result, these operations generate a large percentage of their annual revenues between April and September. The Company has historically generated lower profits or net losses during
its first and fourth fiscal quarters, from October to March. Residential Property Management (with the exception of swimming pool management), Integrated Security Services, and Business Services
generate revenues roughly evenly throughout the fiscal year. 

        The
seasonality of swimming pool management and certain Consumer Services operations (exterior painting and lawn care) results in variations in quarterly EBITDA margins. Variations in
quarterly EBITDA margins can also be caused by acquisitions, which alter the consolidated service mix. The Company's non-seasonal businesses typically generate a consistent EBITDA margin
over all four quarters, while the Company's seasonal businesses experience high EBITDA margins in the first two quarters, offset by negative EBITDA in the last two quarters. As
non-seasonal revenues increase as a percentage of total revenues, the Company's quarterly EBITDA margin fluctuations should be reduced. 

Liquidity and capital resources  

        Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine-month period was $30.8 million, up from $26.8 million in the prior year. The most
significant factor contributing to the increase in cash flow was more efficient utilization of working capital. We believe that cash from operations and other existing resources will continue to be
adequate to satisfy the ongoing working capital needs of the Company. 

        Net
indebtedness as at December 31, 2003 was $151.2 million, down from $153.3 million at March 31, 2003. Net indebtedness is calculated as the current and
non-current portion of long-term debt adjusted for interest rate swaps less cash and cash equivalents. Cash from operating activities was generally offset by investing
activities (business acquisitions and fixed assets), resulting in a small decline in net indebtedness during the period. 

14

        We
are in compliance with the covenants within our financing agreements as at December 31, 2003 and, based on our outlooks for the balance of the year and for fiscal 2005, we
expect to remain in compliance with the covenants. We had $79.8 million of available un-drawn credit as of December 31, 2003. 

        On
October 1, 2003, we completed a private placement of $50 million of 6.40% Senior Secured Notes (the "6.40% Notes") due September 30, 2015. The 6.40% Notes have an
average life of 10.5 years, with equal annual principal repayments commencing September 30, 2012. Concurrent with the issuance of the 6.40% Notes, we amended our credit facility such
that available credit was reduced by $50 million from $140 million to $90 million. Our total borrowing capacity remains unchanged. On October 2, 2003, we entered into
interest rate swap agreements to exchange the fixed rate on the 6.40% Notes for a variable rate of LIBOR + 170 basis points. 

        For
the nine months ended December 31, 2003, capital expenditures were $10.6 million. Significant purchases included service vehicle fleet replacement and expansion for the
Company-owned Consumer Services and Residential Property Management operations and a call center technology upgrade in Business Services. Capital expenditures for the year are expected to be
approximately $12 million, slightly higher than the amount expended during fiscal 2003. 

        In
relation to acquisitions completed during the past three years, we have outstanding contingent consideration totaling $16.5 million as at December 31, 2003
($12.7 million as at March 31, 2003). The amount of the contingent consideration is not recorded as a liability unless the outcome of the contingency is determined to be beyond a
reasonable doubt. The contingent consideration is based on achieving specified earnings levels, and is issued or issuable at the end of the contingency period. When the contingencies are resolved and
additional consideration is distributable, we will record the fair value of the additional consideration as additional costs of the acquired businesses. 

        In
those operations where managements are also minority owners, the Company is party to shareholders' agreements. These agreements allow us to "call" the minority position for a
predetermined formula price, which is usually equal to the multiple of trailing two-year average earnings paid by the Company for the original acquisition. Minority owners may also "put"
their interest to the Company at the same price, with certain limitations. The total value of the minority shareholders' interests, as calculated in accordance with shareholders' agreements, was
approximately $30 million at December 31, 2003 (March 31, 2003 — $26.0 million). While it is not our intention to acquire outstanding
minority interests, this step would materially increase net earnings. On an annual basis, the impact of the acquisition of all minority interests would increase interest expense by
$1.1 million, reduce income taxes by $0.3 million and reduce minority interest share of earnings by $3.2 million, resulting in an approximate increase to net earnings of
$2.4 million. 

Critical accounting policies  

        There has been no change in the Company's critical accounting policies from those described in our annual report on Form 10-K/A for the
year ended March 31, 2003. 

New accounting standards  

        For a discussion of recently issued accounting standards, please refer to note 4 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Forward-looking statements  

        This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains or incorporates by reference certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors created by such legislation. Such forward-looking statements involve risks and
uncertainties and include, but are not limited to, statements regarding future events and the Company's plans, goals and objectives. Such statements are generally accompanied by words such as
"intend", "anticipate", "believe", "estimate", "expect" or similar statements. Our actual results may differ materially from such statements. Factors that could result in such differences, among
others, are: 

•
Political
conditions, including any outbreak or escalation of terrorism or hostilities and the impact thereof on our business.

•
U.
S. and Canadian economic conditions, especially as they relate to consumer spending and business spending on customer relations and promotion.

•
Extreme
weather conditions impacting demand for our services or our ability to perform those services.

•
Competition
in the markets served by the Company.

•
Labor
shortages or increases in wage rates.

•
The
effects of changes in interest rates on our cost of borrowing.

•
Unexpected
increases in operating costs, such as insurance, workers' compensation, health care and fuel prices.

•
Changes
in government policies at the federal, state/provincial or local level that may adversely impact our firearms registration processing, lawn care, textbook
fulfillment or other activities.

•
The
effects of changes in the Canadian dollar foreign exchange rate in relation to the U.S. dollar on the Company's Canadian dollar denominated revenues and expenses.

•
Our
ability to make acquisitions at reasonable prices and successfully integrate acquired operations. 

        Although
we believe that the assumptions underlying our forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove inaccurate and, therefore, there can be no assurance
that the results contemplated in such forward-looking statements will be realized. The inclusion of such forward-looking statements should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any
other person that the future events, plans or expectations contemplated by the Company will be achieved. We note that past performance in operations and share price are not necessarily predictive of
future performance. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  

        During the past three months, there was no material change to our market risk profile, including foreign currency and interest rate risks, as described in
Item 7A of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003 as filed with the SEC. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

a)
Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.
    The Company's CEO and CFO have evaluated the effectiveness of the
Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. They
have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were adequate and effective to ensure that material information relating to
the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries would be made known to them by others within those entities and would be disclosed on a timely basis.

b)
Changes in internal control over financial reporting.
    As of the end of the period covered by this report, there were no
changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

c)
Limitations on the effectiveness of controls.
    The Company's management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that the
Company's disclosure controls will prevent all error and fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of
the control system are met.
