        As
of May 9, 2003, in relation to the Subordinate Voting Shares, there were approximately 300 shareholders of record and approximately 4,000 persons who held shares in the names
of nominees. One shareholder, the President and CEO of the Company, held all of the Multiple Voting Shares. 

        No
dividends were declared by the Registrant during the two fiscal years ended March 31, 2003 and 2002. Our agreements with our lenders prohibit us from declaring dividends
without the prior approval of the lenders, which approval was obtained in May 2003. If dividends were declared, they would be payable in either Canadian or U.S. dollars. 

Taxation  

        The following discussion summarizes certain tax considerations relevant to an investment by individuals and corporations who, for income tax purposes, are
resident in the United States and not in Canada, hold shares as capital property, and do not use or hold the shares in carrying on business through a permanent establishment or in connection
with a fixed base in Canada (collectively "Unconnected U.S. Shareholders"). The Canadian tax consequences of investment in the shares by investors who are not Unconnected
U.S. Shareholders may be expected to differ substantially from the tax consequences discussed herein. This discussion is based upon the provisions of the Income Tax Act (Canada) (the
"Tax Act"), the Convention between Canada and the United States of America with respect to taxes on income and capital (the "Convention") and the published administrative practices of
the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency and judicial decisions, all of which are subject to change. This discussion does not take into account the tax laws of the various provinces or territories of
Canada. 

        This
discussion is intended to be a general description of the Canadian tax considerations and does not take into account the individual circumstances of any particular shareholder. 

        Any
cash and stock dividends on the shares payable to Unconnected U.S. Shareholders generally will be subject to Canadian withholding tax. Under the Convention, the rate of
withholding tax generally applicable to Unconnected U.S. Shareholders is 15%. In the case of a U. S. corporate shareholder owning 10% or more of the voting shares of the Company, the applicable
withholding tax under the Convention is 5%. 

        Capital
gains realized on the disposition of shares by Unconnected U.S. Shareholders will not be subject to tax under the Tax Act unless such shares are taxable Canadian
property within the meaning of the 

15

Tax Act.
Shares will not be taxable Canadian property to a holder unless, at any time during the five-year period immediately preceding the disposition, the holder, or persons with
whom the holder did not deal at arm's length, or any combination thereof, owned 25% or more of the issued shares of any class or series of the Company. If the shares are considered taxable Canadian
property to a holder, the Convention will generally exempt Unconnected U.S. Shareholders from tax under the Tax Act in respect of a disposition of shares, provided the value of the
shares of the Company is not derived principally from real property situated in Canada.

Notes

(1)
Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, 
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
 ("SFAS 142") was adopted
effective April 1, 2001, which resulted in a material decrease in amortization expense and a material increase in net earnings. Fiscal 2001 net earnings, adjusted for SFAS 142, were
$15,560 and net earnings per share were $1.19 (basic) and $1.12 (diluted).

(2)
Excluding
current portion of long-term debt and effect of interest rate swaps.

(3)
EBITDA
is defined as net earnings before extraordinary items, minority interest share of earnings, income taxes, interest, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA excludes income taxes
and interest, both of which are charges that require cash settlement. EBITDA is not a recognized measure for financial statement presentation under United States generally accepted accounting
principles ("U.S. GAAP"). The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure is operating earnings. Operating earnings takes into account depreciation and amortization expenses, while EBITDA
does not. Management utilizes EBITDA as a measure to assess the performance of its operations, to evaluate acquisition candidates and establish pricing, for performance-based compensation purposes,
and within its debt covenants with its lenders. The Company believes EBITDA is a reasonable measure of operating performance because of the low capital intensity of its service operations. The Company
believes EBITDA is a financial metric used by many investors to compare companies, especially in the services industry, on the basis of operating results and the ability to incur and service debt. The
table below reconciles EBITDA to operating earnings.
