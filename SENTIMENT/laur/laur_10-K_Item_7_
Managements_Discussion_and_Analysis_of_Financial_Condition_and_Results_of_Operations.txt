As used in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K (this “Form 10‑K”), unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, references to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company,” “Laureate” and similar references refer collectively to Laureate Education, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

Trademarks and Tradenames
LAUREATE, LAUREATE INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITIES and the leaf symbol are trademarks of Laureate Education, Inc. in the United States and other countries. This Form 10‑K also includes other trademarks of Laureate and trademarks of other persons, which are properties of their respective owners.
Industry and Market Data
We obtained the industry, market and competitive position data used throughout this Form 10‑K from our own internal estimates and research, as well as from industry publications and research, surveys and studies conducted by third‑party sources.
Industry publications, studies and surveys generally state that they have been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, although they do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of such information. We have not independently verified industry, market and competitive position data from third‑party sources. While we believe that our internal business estimates and research are reliable and the market definitions are appropriate, neither such estimates or research nor these definitions have been verified by any independent source.
Forward‑Looking Statements
This Form 10‑K contains “forward‑looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which involve risks and uncertainties. You can identify forward‑looking statements because they contain words such as “believes,” “expects,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “seeks,” “approximately,” “intends,” “plans,” “estimates” or “anticipates” or similar expressions that concern our strategy, plans or intentions. All statements we make relating to estimated and projected earnings, costs, expenditures, cash flows, growth rates and financial results, and all statements we make relating to our current growth strategy and other future plans, strategies or transactions that may be identified, explored or implemented and any litigation or dispute resulting from any completed transaction are forward-looking statements. In addition, we, through our senior management, from time to time make forward‑looking public statements concerning our expected future operations and performance and other developments. All of these forward‑looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may change at any time, including with respect to our current growth strategy and the impact of any completed divestiture or separation transaction on our remaining businesses. Accordingly, our actual results may differ materially from those we expected. We derive most of our forward‑looking statements from our operating budgets and forecasts, which are based upon many detailed assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and, of course, it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, including, without limitation, in conjunction with the forward‑looking statements and risk factors included in this Form 10‑K, are disclosed under various sections throughout this Form 10‑K, including, but not limited to, Item 1—Business, Item 1A—Risk Factors, and Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. All subsequent written and oral forward‑looking statements attributable to us, or persons acting on our behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by the factors discussed in this Form 10‑K. Some of the factors that we believe could affect our results include:
•
the risks associated with operating our portfolio of degree-granting higher education institutions in Mexico and Peru, including complex business, political, legal, regulatory, tax and economic risks;
•
our ability to maintain and, subsequently, increase tuition rates and student enrollments in our institutions;
•
our ability to effectively manage the growth of our business and increase our operating leverage;
•
the risks associated with maintaining the value of our brands and our reputation;
•
the effect of existing international and U.S. laws and regulations governing our business or changes to those laws and regulations or in their application to our business;
•
changes in the political, economic and business climate in the markets in which we operate;
•
risks of downturns in general economic conditions and in the educational services and education technology industries that could, among other things, impair our goodwill and intangible assets;
•
possible increased competition from other educational service providers;
2
•
market acceptance of new service offerings by us or our competitors and our ability to predict and respond to changes in the markets for our educational services;
•
the effect of greater than anticipated tax liabilities;
•
the effect on our business and results of operations from fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies;
•
risks associated with the incorporation of new technologies (including artificial intelligence) into our programs and processes;
•
the fluctuations in revenues due to seasonality;
•
the risks associated with disruptions to our computer networks and other cybersecurity incidents, including misappropriation of personal or proprietary information;
•
the risks associated with protests, strikes or natural or other disasters;
•
our ability to attract and retain key personnel;
•
the risks and uncertainties associated with an epidemic, pandemic or other public health emergency including, but not limited to, effects on student enrollment, tuition pricing, and collections in future periods;
•
our ability to maintain proper and effective internal controls necessary to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis;
•
the risks associated with indebtedness and disruptions to credit and equity markets;
•
our focus on a specific public benefit purpose and producing a positive effect for society may negatively influence our financial performance; and
•
the future trading prices of our common stock and the impact of any securities analysts’ reports on these prices.
We caution you that the foregoing list of important factors may not contain all of the material factors that are important to you. In addition, in light of these risks and uncertainties, the matters referred to in the forward‑looking statements contained in this Form 10‑K may not in fact occur. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward‑looking statement as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by law.
