Item 3. Legal Proceedings
Our former Spanish holding company, Laureate Netherlands Holding B.V. (f/k/a Iniciativas Culturales de España, S.L.), was subject to various tax audits by the Spanish Taxing Authority (“STA”), resulting in the issuance of final assessments based on the STA’s rejection of the tax deductibility of financial expenses related to certain intercompany acquisitions. Accordingly, we have paid assessments totaling approximately $40.8 million for tax years during the period from 2006 to 2015. We filed various appeals of the assessments, which were rejected, and in June 2023, the Spanish Supreme Court ruled in favor of the STA on its appeal regarding these issues. As a result, the Company has no further recourse with respect to the related final assessments for tax years 2006 to 2010. The outcome of any remaining years under audit are not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and thus will not be reported upon by the Company in subsequent periodic reports.
In May 2023, we were notified by t
he STA that an audit of our former Spanish holding company was being initiated in relation to corporate income tax for the period from January 2018 to May 2020 and withholding on account of non-resident income tax for the period from May 2019 to May 2020. In December 2024, after completion of the audit by the STA, the Company paid a final assessment of $0.4 million with respect to this matter, resulting in the closing of the audit.

Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
Market Information
Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq under the symbol “LAUR.”
Holders of Record
There were 56 holders of record of our common stock as of January 31, 2025. The number of beneficial owners of our common stock is substantially greater than the number of record holders because substantially all of our common stock is held in “street name” by banks and brokers.
Dividend Policy
We currently do not anticipate paying any ordinary cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future; however, the Company may consider extraordinary dividend(s) as part of an overall strategy to return capital to shareholders. Notwithstanding any such actions, we expect to retain our future earnings, if any, for use in the operation of our business. The terms of our Credit Agreement limit our ability to pay cash dividends in certain circumstances. Furthermore, if we are in default under our Credit Agreement, our ability to pay cash dividends will be limited in the absence of a waiver of that default or an amendment to such agreement. In addition, our ability to pay cash dividends on shares of our common stock may be limited by restrictions on our ability to obtain sufficient funds through dividends from our subsidiaries. For more information on our Credit Agreement, see “Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 8, Debt, in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Subject to the foregoing, the payment of cash dividends in the future, if any, will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon such factors as earnings levels, capital requirements, our overall financial condition and any other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.
