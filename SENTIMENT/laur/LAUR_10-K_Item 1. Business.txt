Item 1. Business
General
We operate a portfolio of degree-granting higher education institutions in Mexico and Peru. These institutions, which we collectively refer to as the 
Laureate International Universities
 n
etwork, are leading brands in their respective markets and offer a broad range of undergraduate and graduate degrees through campus-based, online and hybrid programs. Collectively, we have approximately 472,000 students enrolled at five institutions with over 50 campuses as of December 31, 2024. Our institutions in Mexico and Peru operate within scaled country networks, which provide advantages in terms of shared infrastructure, technology, curricula and operational best practices. O
ur students are enrolled at traditional, campus-based institutions offering multi-year degrees, with an average program length of four years, similar to leading private
 and public higher education institutions in developed markets such as the United States and Europe. 
Our programs are designed with a distinct emphasis on applied, professional-oriented content for growing career fields and are focused on academic disciplines that we believe offer strong employment opportun
ities and high earnings potential for our students. We continually and proactively adapt our curriculum to the needs of the market. In particular, we emphasize science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) and business disciplines, areas in which we believe that there is large and growing demand, especially in developing countries. Students pursuing degrees in Medicine & Health Sciences, Engineering & Information Technology and Business & Management, our three largest disciplines, constitute approximately 70% of our total post-secondary enrollments. We believe that the work of our graduates in these disciplines creates a positive impact on the communities we serve and strengthens our institutions’ reputations within their respective markets. Our focus on private-pay and our track record for delivering high-quality outcomes to our students, while stressing affordability and accessibility, has been a key reason for our long record of success.
We believe that the higher education markets in Mexico and Peru present an attractive long-term opportunity, primarily because of the large and growing imbalance between the supply and demand for affordable, quality higher education in those markets. We believe that the combination of the projected growth in the middle class, limited government resources dedicated to higher education, and a clear value proposition demonstrated by the higher earnings potential afforded by higher education creates substantial opportunities for high-quality private institutions to meet this growing and unmet demand. By offering high-quality, outcome-focused education, we believe that we enable students to prosper and thrive in the dynamic and evolving knowledge economy.
In many developing markets, traditional higher education students (defined as 18-24 year olds) have historically been served by public universities, which have limited capacity and are often underfunded, resulting in an inability to meet growing student demands and employer requirements. In addition, in many of these same markets, non-traditional students, such as working adults and distance learners, have limited options for pursuing higher education. With strong brands and highly reputed i
nstitutions in Mexico and Peru, we believe that we are uniquely positioned to address these market opportunities.

Our institutions in Mexico and Peru offer traditional higher education students a private education alternative, with multiple brands and price points in each market and innovative programs and strong career-driven outcomes. Additionally, through 
targeted programs and multiple teaching modalities, we are able to serve the differentiated needs of non-traditional students in these markets.
Our program and level of study mix for 2024 was as follows:
Our Segments
We have two reportable segments, which are summarized in the charts below. The following information for our segments is presented as of December 31, 2024.
Our Industry
We operate higher education institutions in Mexico and Peru. These markets are characterized by what we believe is a significant imbalance between supply and demand. The demand for higher education is large and growing and is fueled by 
6
several demographic and economic factors, including a growing middle class, global growth in services and technology-related industries and recognition of the significant personal and economic benefits gained by graduates of higher education institutions. At the same time, the respective Mexican and Peruvian governments often have limited resources to devote to higher education, resulting in a diminished ability by the public sector to meet growing demand, and creating opportunities for private education providers to enter these markets and deliver high-quality education. As a result, the private sector plays a large and growing role in higher education.
Favorable industry dynamics in Mexico and Peru driving growth in the higher education sector include the following:
Large, Growing and Underpenetrated Population of Qualified Higher Education Students.
 In many countries, including throughout Latin America and other developing regions, there is growing demand for higher education based on favorable demographics, increasing secondary completion rates and increasing higher education participation rates, resulting in continued growth in higher education enrollments. While global participation rates have increased for traditional higher education students (defined as 18-24 year olds), the market for higher education in Mexico and Peru, excluding technical-vocational institutes, is still significantly underpenetrated, at approximately 35% and 42%, respectively, as compared to approximately 55% in the United States.
Strong Economic Incentives for Higher Education.
 According to data from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”), in countries that are members of the OECD, the earnings from employment for younger adults (25-34 years) completing higher education was approximately 39% higher, and the earnings advantage reached 68% among older adults (45-54 years), than those of younger and older adults with only an upper secondary education. We believe that the cumulative impact of favorable demographic and socio-economic trends, coupled with the superior earnings potential of higher education graduates, will continue to expand the market for private higher education.
Increasing Role of the Private Sector in Higher Education.
 In both Mexico and Peru, the private sector plays a meaningful role in higher education, bridging supply and demand imbalances created by a lack of capacity at public universities. In Mexico, private education providers constitute 39% of the total higher-education market (46% in states in which we have operations). In Peru, private education providers constitute 76% of the total higher-education market. In addition to capacity limitations, we believe that limited public resources, and the corresponding policy reforms to make higher education systems less dependent on the financial and operational support of local governments, have resulted in increased enrollments in private institutions relative to public institutions.
Increasing Demand for Online Offerings.
 We believe that increasing student demand, new instruction methodologies designed for the online medium, and growing employer and regulatory acceptance of degrees obtained through online and hybrid modalities will continue to drive online learning in Mexico and Peru. Moreover, increasing the percentage of courses taught online in a hybrid educational model has significant cost and capital efficiency benefits, as a greater number of students can be accommodated in existing physical campus space.
Our Strengths and Competitive Advantages
We believe that our key competitive strengths that will enable us to execute our strategy include the following:
Scaled Platform Institutions Across Country Networks.
 Our scale within the countries in which we operate facilitates distinct advantages for our students and allows us to leverage our operating model across multiple brands in Mexico and Peru.
Our in-country networks facilitate competitive advantages related to:
•
Curricula and Programs. 
We are able to leverage our curricula and resources, allowing for the rapid deployment of new programs. Increasing amounts of our curricula are being standardized, allowing us to lower the cost of program development by reusing and sharing content, while improving the quality of our programs.
•
Best Practices. 
Through collaboration across our institutions, best practices for key operational processes, such as digital marketing, data science/AI, scheduling, retention management, market research, campus design, faculty training, student services and recruitment, are identified and then rolled out to all of our institutions.
•
Unified Systems. 
Our scale also permits increased investment in unified technology systems and an opportunity to leverage standardization of processes, centralization of common services (such as information technology, finance and procurement) and intellectual property, and implementing a common operating model and platform for content development, digital campus experiences, student services, recruitment and administrative services within 
7
each country. These systems provide data and insights on a scale that we believe will allow us to improve student experience, retention rates and outcomes, while also enabling a more efficient and lower cost educational delivery model.
Leading Online Technology
.
 Our commitment to digital teaching and learning has been manifested through significant investments in core technologies, as well as in human resources, training and development activities. These investments have been instrumental in establishing a deep level of expertise in online education, facilitating the design and delivery of high quality, effective and differentiated online courses in the markets in which we operate.
Long-Standing and Respected University Brands.
 We believe that we have established a reputation for providing high-quality higher education, and our institutions are among the most respected higher education brands in their local markets. Our institutions have long-established histories and are ranked among the best in their respective countries. 
In addition, many of our institutions and programs have earned the highest accreditation available, which provides us with a strong competitive advantage in local markets. For example, medical school licenses are often the most difficult to obtain and are only granted to institutions that meet rigorous standards. Throughout Mexico and Peru we operate 23 medical and nine dental schools. We believe that the establishment of our medical and dental schools further validates the quality of our institutions and programs and increases brand awareness.
Commitment to Academic Quality.
 We offer high-quality undergraduate, graduate and specialized programs in a wide range of disciplines that generate strong interest from students and provide attractive employment prospects. We focus on programs that prepare our students to become employed in high demand professions. Our curriculum development process includes employer surveys and ongoing research into business trends to determine the skills and knowledge base that will be required by those employers in the future. This information results in timely curriculum upgrades, which helps ensure that our graduates acquire the skills that will make them marketable to employers. We also are committed to continually evaluating our institutions to ensure we are providing the highest quality education to our students. External assessment methodologies, such as QS Stars™, allows us to identify key areas for improvement in order to drive a culture of quality and continual innovation at our institutions.
Attractive Financial Model.
•
Private Pay Model. 
Essentially all of our revenues for 2024

were generated from private pay sources, as there are no material government-sponsored student loan programs in Mexico or Peru. We believe that students’ and families’ willingness to allocate personal resources to fund higher education at our institutions validates our strong value proposition.
•
Revenue Visibility Enhanced by Program Length and Strong Retention. 
The length of our programs provides us with a high degree of revenue visibility. The majority of the academic programs offered by our institutions last between four and five years. Additionally, we actively monitor and manage student retention because of the impact it has on student outcomes and our financial results. Our historical annual student retention rate, which we define as the proportion of prior year students returning in the current year (excluding graduating students), was 79% on average over the last five years. Given our high degree of revenue visibility, we are able to make attractive capital investments and execute other strategic initiatives to help drive sustainable growth in our business.
•
Attractive Margin Profile with Significant Operating Leverage.
 Our scale within each country provides significant advantages, enabling us to operate efficiently with attractive margin levels. We focus on optimizing our operations at the country level through our in-county networks.
Our Strategy
Our mission is to deliver affordable, high-quality education to prepare students for successful careers and lifelong achievement, while building pride, trust, and respect in our communities. To achieve our mission, we execute a strategy enabled by the following initiatives:
Integration of Campus-Based Operations in Mexico and Peru.
 Our institutions in Mexico and Peru serve approximately 472,000 students in a relatively homogenous operating environment, creating a unique opportunity to harvest the benefits of scale. We believe that by implementing best practices within each country we will enable closer collaboration and facilitate innovation and improved student experiences. We believe that this unification will enable us to be more nimble in our day-to-
8
day operations and will allow us to extract valuable insights from more data across our network. Further, we believe that integration will enable further innovation and efficiency in our academic model and operations, and allow us to expand our market share.
Leverage and Expand Existing Portfolio.
 We will continue to focus on opportunities to expand our programs and the type of students that we serve, as well as our capacity in our markets to meet local demand, leveraging our existing platform to execute on attractive organic growth opportunities. In particular, we intend to add new programs and course offerings, expand target student demographics and, where appropriate, increase capacity at existing campuses and through hybrid online opportunities, open new campuses and enter new cities in existing markets. We believe that these initiatives will drive growth and provide an attractive return on capital.
•
Add New Programs and Course Offerings. 
We will continue to develop new programs and course offerings to address the changing needs in the markets. New programs and course offerings enable us to provide a high-quality education that we believe is desired by students and prospective employers. In addition, we have a comprehensive suite of current program offerings, all of which are not currently offered in each campus in which we operate. We intend to lift and shift many of those current programs to the campuses where they are not currently being offered, with a particular focus on our health sciences vertical.
•
Expand Target Student Demographics. 
We use sophisticated analytical techniques to identify opportunities to provide quality education to new or underserved student populations where market demand is not being met, such as non-traditional students (e.g., working adults, life-long learners) who may value flexible scheduling options, as well as traditional students. Our ability to provide quality education to these underserved markets has provided additional growth opportunities to our network and we intend to leverage our management capabilities and local knowledge to further capitalize on these opportunities in new and existing markets.
•
Increase Capacity at Existing and New Campus Locations. 
We will continue to make demand-driven investments in additional capacity throughout our network by expanding existing campuses and opening new campuses, including in new cities. We employ a highly analytical process based on economic and demographic trends, and demand data for the local market to determine when and where to expand capacity. When opening a new campus or expanding existing facilities, we use best practices that we have developed over more than the past decade to cost-effectively expedite the opening and development of that location.
Expand Online and Hybrid Education Programs.
 We intend to increase the number of our students that receive their education through fully online or hybrid programs to meet the growing demands of students. Our online initiative is designed to not only provide students with access to innovative programs and modern digital experiences, but also to diversify our offerings, increase our enrollments and expand our digital solutions in a capital efficient manner, leveraging current infrastructure and improving classroom utilization.
Our operating model is targeting to have 40% to 60% percent of our student credit hours taken online going forward. Currently, we operate within this range with adaptability and flexibility. With a common learning management system implemented across our universities, we believe that we have the expertise to continue to expand online and hybrid offerings to meet the growing demand for this market opportunity, allowing us to differentiate ourselves further from our competitors.
We continue to accelerate the advancement of online education programs and technology-enabled solutions that deliver high-quality differentiated student experiences for our institutions at scale.
Our strategy for the online opportunity includes the following components:
•
Hybrid Online Programs. 
Traditional 18-24 year old students attending campus-based institutions are increasingly seeking digital learning experiences that are blended with in-person learning. We provide those students with a hybrid learning experience, mixing face-to-face classroom experience with technology through our online platform, which we believe improves the student experience by providing them with a wide range of online courses, interactive discussions, virtual experiences, digital resources, and simulations that enhance their learning experiences both within and outside the classroom.
•
Fully Online Programs. 
Many students require flexible learning modules to accommodate work and personal responsibilities. Often, these students are working adults who are looking to either complete an undergraduate or post-graduate degree, or who want to gain a credential to accelerate or change careers. Our fully online programs provide students with a high-quality curriculum experience to achieve their goals.

Our Segments and Institutions
Laureate offers its educational services through two reportable segments: Mexico and Peru.
We determine our segments based on information utilized by our chief operating decision maker to allocate resources and assess performance. See Note 6, Business and Geographic Segment Information, in our consolidated financial statements for financial information regarding our operating segments and financial information about geographic areas; see also “Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations—Segment Results” and “—Overview—Factors Affecting Comparability—Seasonality” in this Form 10-K.

Competition
We face competition in both of our reportable segments. We believe that competition focuses on price, educational quality, reputation, brand positioning, location and facilities.
The market for higher education in Mexico and Peru is highly fragmented and marked by large numbers of local competitors. The target demographics are primarily 18- to 24-year-olds in the countries in which we compete. Public institutions tend to be less expensive, if not free, but limited in capacity. The top public universities in these market are selective, and many of the other public universities are less focused on practical programs aligned around career opportunities. This creates market demand for private educational providers. We compete with other private higher education institutions on the basis of price, educational quality, reputation and location. We believe that we compare favorably with competitors because of our focus on quality, professional-oriented curriculum and the competitive advantages provided by our in-country networks. There are a number of private and public institutions in both of the countries in which we operate, and it is difficult to predict how the markets will evolve and how many competitors there will be in the future. We expect competition to increase as the Mexican and Peruvian markets continue to develop.
See “Item 1A—Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—The higher education market is very competitive, and we may not be able to compete effectively.”
Intellectual Property
We currently own, or have filed applications for, trademark registrations for the word “Laureate,” for “Laureate International Universities” and for the Laureate leaf logo in the trademark offices of all jurisdictions in which we operate institutions of h
igher learning. We have also registered or filed applications in the applicable jurisdictions in which we operate for the trademarks “La
ureate Online International” and “Laureate Online Education.” In addition, we have the rights to trade names, logos and other intellectual property specific to most of our higher education institutions, in the countries in which those institutions operate.
Human Capital
We currently enroll approximately 472,000 students across our five institutions in Mexico and Peru, in campus-based, fully online, and hybrid learning programs. Our students are supported by a workforce of more than 31,800 employees, including 18,000 academic staff.
More than 99% of our employees are based in Mexico or Peru, and most of our corporate team are based in the United States. 
10
We believe our future success depends on our ability to attract, develop, and retain skilled employees in a highly competitive talent market. Therefore, we strive to be a company our employees are proud to work for and continue to invest in ongoing training and development – consistent with our belief in the power of education to change lives.
Leadership and Governance
•
Our Board of Directors receive regular reports on talent development, succession planning, and company-wide culture-building efforts. Internally, this work is led by our Senior Vice President, People and Culture, in close collaboration with the Chief Executive Officer and our executive leadership team. 
•
Various committees of our Board of Directors also take an active role in human capital oversight and talent management. This includes the Compensation Committee which works with top-tier external consultants to ensure compensation is benchmarked against industry standards, and our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee manages a talent matrix for our Board of Directors to ensure existing and potential future Board members bring skills and experience most closely aligned with the needs of our business as we continue to grow.

Ongoing Training and Access to Education Assistance 
•
Scholarships and discounts are made available at each of our five institutions for employees (an average of approximately 80% of tuition is paid for employees studying at one of our five institutions). Significant discounts are also provided for immediate family members of employees in Mexico and Peru. 
•
In the United States, education assistance is offered to all corporate employees to pursue additional education opportunities or certifications.
•
Regular workshops covering a wide variety of relevant topics complement mandatory training for all employees (which include courses on Ethics and Compliance and cybersecurity). 
Employee Engagement 
•
Comprehensive employee engagement surveys are conducted regularly. In 2024, employees in Mexico and the United States responded to engagement surveys and our employees in Peru are scheduled to do so in the first half of 2025.

Our overall engagement score in Mexico increased from 72% to 73% in 2024, and the overall engagement score for our US-based corporate team was 84%, an increase from 70% in 2022. In addition, multiple metrics are consistently tracked to monitor engagement and employee satisfaction, such as voluntary attrition, changes in individual and team performance and outcomes, and reports to the ethics and compliance hotline.
Performance Management and Ongoing Development
•
We have a company-wide approach to performance management, goal setting, feedback, and performance-based compensation, which, at a minimum, includes two formal review checkpoints per year. 
•
In 2024, all members of our executive team continued to participate in an executive coaching and development program and contributed to a range of culture-building and workforce development initiatives.

Compensation and Employee Benefits 
•
Employee compensation is reviewed and benchmarked annually against independent market data to ensure our compensation remains competitive and fair.
•
Senior leaders across the United States, Mexico and Peru participate in our long-term equity incentive program as part of our competitive compensation and talent retention initiatives.
•
We continue to offer a wide range of benefits to our employees. Our portfolio of benefits support and promote the physical and mental health of our employees and are regularly benchmarked to ensure competitiveness against industry standards.
11
Safety and Security 
•
We remain committed to the safety and well-being of all employees, students, and other stakeholders. Throughout 2024, we took a range of actions to advance our commitment to safety and security. 
•
In both Mexico and Peru, we employ dedicated security teams to develop and execute strategies to promote the safety of all students, employees, and campuses. Incidents and risks are reported, reviewed, and addressed through established cross-functional incident response teams. 
•
In addition, our focus on safety and security is complemented by our long-standing Discrimination and Harassment policy.
•
Cybersecurity is a major area of focus across the Company.
•
Our employees are expected to complete mandatory cybersecurity training multiple times per year, covering a wide range of topics aimed at keeping employees and the business protected from increasing cyber risks. 
•
Strict data management controls are enforced across the Company to ensure our workforce and human capital data is appropriately and securely captured and stored. 
Recognizing the Impact of Our People
•
Through the expertise, passion, and commitment of our people, we are making a positive impact within and beyond communities across Mexico and Peru. In 2024, we published our 2023 Impact Report which recognizes and celebrates the impact our people are creating, aligned to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Our Impact Reports are available at laureate.net/impact. 
•
These Impact Reports feature data and case studies tracked by our Impact and our Academic Quality Committees –comprised of impact and academic leaders from Mexico and Peru and from multiple functional areas including Finance, Communications, Academic, Operations and Ethics and Compliance.

Our History
Since making our first investment in global higher education in 1999, we have focused on expanding access to differentiated higher education and learning opportunities to traditionally underserved areas of the world. In August 2007, we were acquired in a leveraged buyout by a consortium of investment funds and other investors. On February 6, 2017, we consummated our initial public offering and shares of our common stock began trading on the Nasdaq under the symbol “LAUR”.
Public Benefit Corporation Status
In October 2015, we redomiciled in Delaware as a public benefit corporation as a demonstration of our long-term commitment to our mission to benefit our students and society. Public benefit corporations are intended to produce a public benefit and to operate in a responsible and sustainable manner. Under Delaware law, public benefit corporations are required to identify in their certificate of incorporation the public benefit or benefits they will promote, and their directors have a duty to manage the affairs of the corporation in a manner that balances the pecuniary interests of the stockholders, the best interests of those materially affected by the corporation’s conduct, and the specific public benefit or public benefits identified in the public benefit corporation’s certificate of incorporation. Public benefit corporations organized in Delaware also are required to assess their benefit performance internally and to disclose publicly at least biennially a report detailing their success in meeting their benefit objectives.
Our public benefit, as provided in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, is to produce a positive effect (or a reduction of negative effects) for society and persons by offering diverse education programs delivered online and on premises operated in the communities that we serve. By doing so, we believe that we provide greater access to cost-effective, high-quality higher education that enables more students to achieve their academic and career aspirations. Our operations are outside the United States, where there is a large and growing imbalance between the supply and demand for quality higher education. Our stated public benefit is firmly rooted in our company mission and our belief that when our students succeed, countries prosper and societies benefit. Becoming a public benefit corporation underscores our commitment to our purpose and our stakeholders, including students, regulators, employers, local communities and stockholders.

Industry Regulation
Mexican Regulation
Mexican law provides that private entities are entitled to render education services in accordance with applicable legal provisions. These provisions regulate the education services rendered by the federal government, the states and private entities and contain guidelines for the allocation of the higher education role among the federal government, the states and the municipalities, including their respective economic contributions, in order to jointly participate in the development and coordination of higher education.
There are three levels of regulation in Mexico: federal, state and municipal. The federal authority is the Federal Ministry of Public Education (
Secretaría de Educación Pública
). Each of the 31 states and Mexico City has the right to establish a local Ministry of Education, and each municipality of each state may establish a municipal education authority that only has authority to advertise and promote educational services and/or activities.
Some functions are exclusive to the Federal Ministry of Education, such as the establishment of study plans and programs for Basic and Mid-Superior education services. There are also concurrent functions, such as the granting and withdrawal of governmental recognition of validity of studies (
Reconocimiento de Validez Oficial de Estudios
) (“REVOEs”).
The General Law on Education (
Ley General de Educación
) in Mexico classifies studies in the following three categories: (i) Basic Education, which includes pre-school (kindergarten), elementary school and junior high school (
secundaria
); (ii) Mid-Superior Education, which includes high school (
preparatoria
) and equivalent studies, as well as professional education that does not consider 
preparatoria
 as a prerequisite; and (iii) Superior Education, which includes the studies taught after 
preparatoria,
 including undergraduate school (
licenciatura
), specialties (
especialidades
), master’s studies, doctorate studies and studies for teachers (
educación normal
).
The REVOEs are issued either by the Federal Ministry of Education under the General Law on Education or by any of the state Ministries of Education under the applicable state law. REVOEs are granted for each program taught at each campus. If there is a change in the program or in the campus at which it is taught, the entity will need to get a new REVOE.
The Federal Ministry of Education has issued a set of general resolutions (
Acuerdos
) that regulate the general requirements for obtaining REVOEs. The main 
Acuerdos
 are (i) 
Acuerdo
 243, issued on May 27, 1998, which sets the general guidelines for obtaining an Authorization or REVOE; (ii) 
Acuerdo
 17/11/17, issued on November 10, 2017, which sets the procedures related to REVOEs for Superior Education studies; and (iii) 
Acuerdo
 18/11/18, issued on November 27, 2018, which defines the different levels, models and educational options at Superior Education. The Federal Ministry of Education recommends to the local Ministries of Education the adoption and inclusion of the provisions contained in 
Acuerdo
 243 and 
Acuerdo
 17/11/17 in the local Law on Education and other applicable local laws and regulations.
Depending on each state, other requirements may apply; for example, in certain states, private institutions that provide educational services with REVOEs need to be registered with the corresponding local authorities.
Acuerdo
 17/11/17 regulates in detail the provisions contained under the General Law on Education to grant REVOEs for Superior Education studies, regarding faculty, plans and programs of studies, inspection visits, procedures, etc. 
Acuerdo
 17/11/17 also provides that private institutions that provide Superior Education services in accordance with presidential decrees or secretarial resolutions (
acuerdos secretariales
) issued specifically to them may maintain the obligations provided to them thereunder and may function under the simplified provisions of 
Acuerdo
 17/11/17. Currently, Universidad Tecnológica de México, S.C. and Universidad del Valle de México, S.C. have secretarial resolutions that were issued in their favor before the 
13
issuance of 
Acuerdo
 17/11/17. The obligations contained in these secretarial resolutions generally conform to the obligations provided under 
Acuerdo
 17/11/17.
The regulatory authorities are entitled to conduct inspection visits to the facilities of educational institutions to verify compliance with applicable legal provisions. Failure to comply with applicable legal provisions may result in the imposition of fines, the cancellation of the applicable REVOE and the closure of the education facilities.
Private institutions with REVOEs are required to grant a minimum percentage of scholarships to students. 
Acuerdo
 17/11/17 requires private institutions to grant scholarships to at least five percent of the total students registered during each academic term. Scholarships consist, in whole or in part, of payment of the registration and tuition fees established by the educational institution.
Private entities may also obtain the recognition of validity of their programs from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (
Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México
 or “UNAM”). The General Regulations of Incorporation and Validation of Studies issued by UNAM provide that programs followed in private entities may be “incorporated” to UNAM in order for UNAM to recognize their validity.
The UNAM regulations also require private entities incorporated to UNAM to grant scholarships to at least five percent of the total students registered at such entity. The students entitled to have this benefit will be selected by UNAM. Some of our high school programs and one of our medical programs are incorporated to UNAM.
A new higher education bill was enacted in April 2021. No foreseeable material changes are expected to impact the business as a result of this bill and expected secondary provisions.
Peruvian Regulation
We operate three post-secondary education institutions in Peru, two of which are universities, and one of which is a technical-vocational institution that is licensed as both a college and an institute. Peruvian law provides that universities and technical-vocational institutes can be operated as public or private entities and that the private entities may be organized for profit. The Ministry of Education (“MINEDU”) has overall responsibility for the national education system.
The university law enacted by the Peruvian Congress in 2014 (the “University Law”) regulates the establishment, operation, monitoring and closure of universities and promotes continuous improvement of quality at Peruvian universities. The University Law created a new agency, the Superintendencia Nacional de Educación Superior Universitaria (“SUNEDU”), which is responsible for carrying out the governmental role in university regulation, including ensuring quality. Under the University Law, institutional autonomy is recognized, and universities are permitted to create their own internal governance rules and determine their own academic, management and economic systems, including curriculum design and entrance and graduation requirements. In July 2022, the Peruvian Congress enacted a law that eliminated SUNEDU's powers for the approval of new careers, schools and faculties.
In August 2024, the Peruvian Congress amended the University Law to make licenses permanent, which replaced SUNEDU's authority to grant renewable licenses for specific time periods. In order to keep their licenses in force, universities have to comply with, at a minimum, certain basic quality conditions (“BQCs”) (i.e., that they have specified academic goals and that the degrees granted and plans of study are aligned with those goals; that their academic offerings are compatible with their planning goals (e.g., there is sufficient labor demand for careers offered); that there are only two regular semesters of studies per year; that they have appropriate infrastructure and equipment; that they engage in research; that they have a sufficient supply of qualified teachers, at least 25% of whom will need to be full-time; that they supply adequate basic complementary educational services (e.g., medical and psychological services and sports activities); that they provide appropriate placement office services; and that they have transparency of institutional information). Both UPC and UPN have had licenses granted by SUNEDU in place since 2017. 
The University Law, as amended in August 2024, allows for the educational services to be provided by three modalities: (i) face-to-face learning (with a maximum of 20% virtual credits), (ii) hybrid learning (with up to 60% of the total credits of the academic program allowed to be taken virtually) and (iii) virtual learning (up to 100% of academic credits, except for programs that require in-person experiments and practices). 
Technical-vocational institutes are regulated by the MINEDU, which grants operating licenses for six years, after which the Ministry conducts a revalidation process. The technical-vocational institutes and colleges law enacted in 2016 (the “Institutes and Colleges Law”) created two types of institutions: Higher Education Institutes (“Institutes”), which are dedicated to

technical careers and Higher Education Colleges (“Colleges”), which are devoted to technical careers related to education, as well as science and information technology. Institutes grant technical bachelor degrees and professional technical degrees. Institutes and Colleges are subject to a mandatory license granted by the MINEDU, based on an evaluation to determine compliance with BQCs. BQCs include: an appropriate institutional management guaranteeing a proper relation with the educational model of the institution; appropriate academic management and proper program studies aligned with the MINEDU norms; appropriate infrastructure and equipment to develop educational activities; adequate teachers, 20% of whom will need to be full-time; and appropriate financial and economic provisions. Unlike licenses, quality accreditation is voluntary, except for certain careers for which it might be mandatory as determined by law. Such accreditation is taken into consideration for access to public grants for scholarships and research, among other things. Private Institutes and Colleges may be organized as for-profit or not-for-profit entities under Peruvian law. In 2023, Cibertec's Institute was granted an Institutes license renewal for a six-year period. Also during 2023, Cibertec was granted a Colleges license for a six-year period, which allows Cibertec to offer programs for professional bachelor degrees.
