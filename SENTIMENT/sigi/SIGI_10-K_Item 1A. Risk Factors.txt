Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Certain risk factors can significantly impact our business, liquidity, capital resources, results of operations, financial condition, and debt ratings.  These risk factors might affect, alter, or change actions in executing our long-term capital strategy.  Examples include, without limitation, contributing capital to any or all of our ten property and casualty insurance subsidiaries ("Insurance Subsidiaries"), issuing additional debt and/or equity securities, repurchasing our existing debt and/or equity securities, or increasing or decreasing common stockholders' dividends.  We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors that we cannot predict or assess may emerge at any time.  Consequently, we can neither predict such new risk factors nor assess the potential future impact on our business.

Risks Related to our Insurance Operations

We are subject to losses from catastrophic events.
Losses from natural and human-made catastrophes can negatively impact our financial results.  Examples include hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, thunderstorms, severe winter weather, derechos, floods, and fires, some related to climate change, and criminal and terrorist acts, including cyber-attacks, civil unrest, and explosions.  The frequency and severity of these catastrophes are inherently unpredictable, and the frequency and severity of catastrophe losses have increased globally in recent years.  In many cases, the increase in catastrophe losses relate to small- to- medium-sized events that primary insurers retain and do not cede to reinsurers.  We use sophisticated catastrophe modeling techniques to manage our exposure, but actual exposure and loss experience can materially differ from catastrophe model estimates.  For example, catastrophe models did not fully estimate the potential for some recent catastrophe loss activity (such as Winter Storm Elliott freeze losses in December 2022) and the concurrent economic inflation on construction costs.
Our most significant natural and/or human-made catastrophe exposures are (i) hurricanes impacting the Eastern U.S., (ii) severe convective storms, including hailstorms and tornadoes, (iii) winter storms, (iv) earthquakes, and (v) terrorism events.  Single storms could adversely impact our financial results, but it is also possible that we experience more than one severe catastrophic event in any given calendar year.  We track our severe weather and catastrophe losses using definitions and information we obtain from Insurance Services Office, Inc.'s ("ISO") Property Claim Services unit, an internationally recognized authority on insured property losses from catastrophes in the U.S., Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Certain factors can impact our estimates of ultimate costs for natural and/or human-made catastrophes, including:
•
Inability to access portions of the affected areas after a catastrophic event;
•
Scarcity of necessary labor and materials that delay repairs and increase our loss costs;
•
Regulatory uncertainties, including new or expanded interpretations of coverage;
•
Residual market assessment-related increases in our catastrophe losses;
•
Potential fraud and inflated repair costs, partly driven by (a) demand surge post-event and (b) opportunistic service providers;
•
Higher loss expenses due to shortages of claims adjusters available to appraise damage;
•
Late claims reporting;
•
Escalation of business interruption costs due to infrastructure disruption; and
•
Whether the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury certifies an event as a terrorist act under TRIPRA.
Natural catastrophes
Temperature changes can impact weather patterns and the frequency and/or severity of catastrophes, including hurricanes, severe convective storms, wildfires, and flooding – all of which could cause our catastrophe losses to increase relative to historical levels.
A significant component of climate change risk is that the frequency and severity of extreme weather events may evolve differently relative to historical levels – leading to greater model uncertainty.  Climate change models project significant differences in global regional warming above pre-industrial levels, depending on future climate mitigation levels and geographic location.  These global regional differences, whether attributable to nature or human activities, include increases in (i) mean temperature in most land and ocean regions, (ii) hot extremes in most inhabited regions, (iii) heavy precipitation in several regions, and (iv) the probability of drought and precipitation deficits in some regions.
Human-made catastrophes
Cyber Attacks and Incidents
The risk of a wide-scale criminal or terrorist cyber-attack has become more significant and has drawn increased attention from IT and national security experts, U.S. policymakers, the U.S. military, and the insurance industry.  There is general recognition that a wide-scale cyber-attack that simultaneously impacts multiple victims is more likely, and insurance industry systemic risk has increased.  We have identified three primary sources of potential insured exposure to cyber losses:  (i) cyber-specific policies designed to cover both first-party and third-party losses; (ii) affirmative cyber coverage grants included in other types of policies, such as commercial property or businessowners' policies; and (iii) "silent cyber" exposures, otherwise known as non-affirmative cyber exposures, which describes cyber risk that is neither expressly covered nor excluded in insurance policies.  This exposure may exist if courts, regardless of intent, interpret policy forms without specific related coverage exclusions to provide coverage for a cyber-related incident.
23 
Table

Contents
We provide cyber-specific policies to our commercial lines and personal lines customers through 100% reinsured solutions with highly-rated specialty cyber markets.  These solutions allow us to meet our customers' needs for cyber insurance while mitigating our underwriting risk as we develop our expertise in the cyber insurance market.
Beyond our cyber-specific policies, some of our other insurance policies may provide coverage following a cyber event in certain circumstances:
•
We offer limited first-party affirmative cyber coverage in our commercial property and businessowners' policy forms.  We limited our "silent cyber" exposure through an affirmative coverage grant subject to a sub-limit.
•
Our base property forms typically include a $2,000 or $10,000 cyber coverage grant.  Most of our property policies also contain an affirmative endorsement providing "virus and harmful code" coverage subject to a sub-limit.  Over 90% of our policies with virus/harmful code coverage on commercial property, businessowners', commercial output policy, or inland marine forms have sub-limits of $25,000 or lower.  For policies effective October 1, 2022 and later, we implemented cyber incident exclusions that exclude malicious cyber except for the sub-limited coverage provided in the base ISO coverage forms and our property and businessowners' property “virus and harmful code” extension endorsements.  These exclusions clarify coverage and have no premium impact.
•
Most of our general liability and businessowners' policies exclude cyber-related liability losses, except for "bodily injury."  Our specific cyber-exclusion and liability forms' lack of affirmative sub-limited cyber coverage, effectively limit most "silent cyber" exposure.
•
By statute, workers compensation policies do not have cyber exclusions, and a cyber-attack-related workplace injury could trigger coverage.
Terrorism
We are required to participate in TRIPRA, now extended to December 31, 2027, for our Standard Commercial Lines and E&S Lines business.  TRIPRA rescinded all previously approved coverage exclusions for terrorism and requires private insurers and the U.S. government to share the risk of loss on future acts of terrorism certified by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury.  Under TRIPRA, each participating insurer must pay a significant deductible of specified losses before federal assistance is available.  Our $619 million deductible is based on a percentage of our prior year’s applicable Standard Commercial Lines and E&S Lines premiums.  In 2025, the federal government will pay 80% of losses above the deductible, with the insurer retaining 20%.  Although TRIPRA will mitigate some of our loss exposure to a large-scale terrorist attack, the size of our deductible and 20% co-participation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings.  If the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury does not certify specific terrorist events, we could be required to pay terrorism-related covered losses without TRIPRA's risk-sharing benefits.  We also could be required to pay terrorism-related losses for customers who declined terrorism coverage.
Our primary workers compensation policies are required to cover terrorism risk, so TRIPRA applies to those policies.  Insureds with non-workers compensation commercial policies can accept or decline our terrorism coverage or negotiate with us for other terms.  In 2024, 84% of our Standard Commercial Lines non-workers compensation policyholders purchased terrorism coverage that included nuclear, biological, chemical, and radioactive ("NBCR") events.  TRIPRA also applies to cyber liability insurance policies reported under a Terrorism Risk Insurance Program-eligible line of insurance.
Many states mandate that commercial property policies cover fire following an act of terrorism - regardless of whether the insured purchased terrorism coverage.  We also sometimes elect to provide terrorism coverage for lines of business not included in TRIPRA, such as Commercial Automobile.  TRIPRA has never covered personal lines of business.  Our Standard Personal Lines homeowner policies exclude nuclear losses but not biological, chemical, or conventional terrorism losses.  Our current reinsurance programs cover some losses from conventional foreign and domestic terrorism acts but not NBCR events.
An increase in natural or man-made catastrophe losses, including a systemic cyber-attack that produces an aggregation of property and/or casualty cyber losses, will reduce our net income and stockholders’ equity and could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial strength, and debt ratings.  The closer a catastrophe occurs to the end of a reporting period, the more likely we have limited information to estimate loss and loss expense reserves, increasing the uncertainty of our estimates.  More comprehensive claims information available after a reporting period may result in reserve changes in subsequent periods.
Our loss and loss expense reserves may not adequately cover actual losses and expenses
.
We maintain reserves for our estimated liability for loss and loss expense associated with reported and unreported insurance claims.  Estimating loss and loss expense reserves is inherently uncertain, and there is no method for precisely estimating the ultimate liability for the settlement of claims.  We base our loss and loss expense reserve estimates on our internal in-depth reserve review, which uses our loss experience, claims payment and reporting patterns, and our view of underlying claims frequency and severity trends.  We supplement the estimates with other subjective considerations, including projected impacts 
24 
Table
 of 
Contents
from economic, political, social, and legal developments or trends, such as inflation, judicial trends and tort decisions, and various state legislative initiatives.  We cannot predict the timing or impact of these developments or trends with certainty, and we cannot be sure the reserves we establish are adequate or will be so in the future.
We review our reserve position quarterly and adjust the reserve position accordingly.  An increase in reserves (i) reduces net income and stockholders' equity, and (ii) could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial strength, and debt ratings.  As we underwrite new business and renew existing business, we estimate future loss cost trends in pricing our products to generate an adequate risk-adjusted return.  If our future loss cost trend estimates prove to be understated, our pricing of future new and renewal business could be inadequate to cover actual loss costs, and our future loss and loss expense reserves could be understated. 
Three examples of how loss and loss expense reserves might be affected by economic, political, social, or legal developments or trends are:
•
If economic inflation, including medical inflation, is higher than our assumptions, our loss and loss expense reserves for our longer tail lines of business could be insufficient.  For example, 2022 inflation rates reflected in the overall consumer price index ("CPI"), the Core CPI, and the Producer Price Index, were higher than in 2021.  While inflation moderated in 2023 and 2024, it remains elevated relative to the Federal Reserve’s long-term 2% target.  The workers compensation line of business is particularly susceptible to inflation because of its extended payment pattern and exposure to medical care services and commodities.  While medical inflation has been low for several years, our workers compensation medical severity trend has risen recently.  If this trend continues and medical care costs increase significantly or persist at a higher level for an extended period, our overall loss and loss expense reserves could be materially impacted.  Our short-tail property lines of business are also susceptible to inflation because of their exposure to increased labor and material costs.
•
Social inflation refers to the phenomenon where societal factors, such as attitudes, perceptions, and cultural changes, contribute to increased insurance claims costs and litigation.  It often leads to higher payouts in legal settlements and jury awards, and impacts insurance premiums for businesses and individuals.  This inflation is driven by various factors, including changing jury attitudes, increased litigation funding, larger awards in court cases, increased willingness to undergo surgery, and novel interpretations of liability.  Social inflation can affect all lines of business.  However, the automobile liability, general liability, and corresponding umbrella lines of business involving third-party claimants tend to be more susceptible to social inflationary impacts.  Our reserve for loss and loss expense could be insufficient if impacts from social inflation exceed our assumptions.
•
Various states have expanded or could expand the statute of limitations for civil actions alleging sexual abuse.  By retroactively permitting previously time-barred claims, these "reviver" laws may result in insurance claims that could significantly increase loss costs and require re-evaluating previously established reserves or creating new reserves.  Since reviver statutes have been enacted, we have received some notices of claims or potential claims for acts alleged to have occurred, some dating as far back as the 1950s.  Without prior experience, we cannot estimate how many "reviver" claims notices we may receive.  Most notices (i) are blanket notices sent by attorneys representing claimants unsure of the alleged assailant or supervising entity's insurer or policy (if any) and (ii) may not implicate any of our or a predecessor's insurance policies.  For those we determine implicate one of our or a predecessor's policy, we (i) have investigated or are investigating facts, (ii) have evaluated policy terms, (iii) believe we have appropriate coverage defenses to most of these claims and/or sufficient reinsurance protections, and (iv) have considered these factors in establishing our reserves, which we believe provide a reasonable estimate of the aggregate ultimate net exposure for these claims.  We face related litigation risks because policyholders and claimants may challenge our coverage positions.  We discuss these risks further below in the Risk Factor entitled, "
We are engaged in ordinary routine legal proceedings incidental to our insurance operations that are inherently unpredictable and could impact our reputation and/or have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods."
For further discussion on our loss and loss expense reserves, please see the "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" section of Item 7. "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." and Note 2. "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." of this Form 10-K.

Our ability to reduce our risk exposure depends on the availability and cost of reinsurance.
We transfer a significant portion of our underwriting risk to third parties through reinsurance, which are primarily annual contracts that reimburse us for losses exceeding specified thresholds on a per-loss or an aggregate basis.  Typically, our 
25 
Table

Contents
reinsurance coverages align with the coverages in our primary insurance policies, including coverages for catastrophes.  Historically, commercial property and homeowners losses have accounted for most of our catastrophe-related reinsurance claims.  We determine the amount of reinsurance we purchase by analyzing historical losses and using various modeling software programs that analyze our Insurance Subsidiaries' risks, particularly for catastrophes.  Insufficient reinsurance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings.
Reinsurance availability; retentions; coverage limits, terms, conditions, and exclusions; and cost depend on market conditions influenced by traditional direct- and broker-placed reinsurance, retrocessional reinsurance, and catastrophe bond market capacity.  These market factors can cause fluctuations in reinsurance costs that do not necessarily correlate to our loss experience.  State insurance regulators generally permit us to consider catastrophe reinsurance expense in our filed rates and rating plans.  However, the conditions and timing of regulatory approval may not align with the actual reinsurance expense.  Reinsurance expense increases that are not considered or approved in our filed rates and rating plans will reduce our earnings.  If we cannot negotiate desired reinsurance amounts or terms, we may experience increased reinsurance expense and increased risk retention on individual or aggregate claim losses that could limit our ability to write future business.
The reinsurance market became increasingly challenging and expensive since January 1, 2023, as monetary and social inflation-driven demand for increased reinsurance coverages coincided with reduced reinsurance capacity from poor reinsurance loss experience, particularly for general liability and catastrophe and non-catastrophe property losses, increased reinsurer investment losses, and foreign exchange rate impacts.  While reinsurance market conditions have since stabilized, as pricing has moderated and capacity has increased, reinsurance purchasers continue to face higher pricing and more restrictive coverage appetite from reinsurers than they did before January 1, 2023.  Our Insurance Subsidiaries face increased underwriting risk and loss exposure for specific primary policy perils, like cyber and communicable diseases, which our reinsurance policies now principally exclude.  Our reinsurance contracts also restrict our ability to cede certain types of potential terrorism-related losses.  Increased underwriting risk from these and other risks could increase our net loss and loss expense and the volatility of our underwriting results.  Decreased reinsurance availability would also increase our underwriting risk if we cannot fully place our targeted reinsurance treaty coverage on renewal.
Even with the benefits of reinsurance, our catastrophe risk exposure could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings.
We are exposed to credit risk.
We face credit risk in several areas of our insurance operations, including from third parties:
•
Our reinsurers, which are obligated to make us payments under our reinsurance agreements.  Reinsurance credit risk can fluctuate over time, increasing during periods of high industry catastrophe and liability losses.  Reinsurers generally manage their significant loss exposure through their own reinsurance programs, or retrocessions, and we do not have complete details about them.  If our reinsurers experience difficulty collecting on their retrocession programs or reinstating retrocession coverage after a large loss, we may not receive timely or full payment of our reinsurance claims.  Consequently, we have direct and indirect counterparty credit risk to our reinsurers and the reinsurance industry, which is a global but concentrated market.
•
Certain life insurance companies, if they fail to fulfill their contractual obligations to our policyholders or claimants under annuities we purchased as part of structured claims settlements.
•
Some of our independent distribution partners, who collect premiums for us from policyholders.
•
Some policyholders, who are directly obligated to us for premium and/or deductible payments, the timing of which may be impacted by mandated payment moratoriums.
Our exposure to credit risk could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings.

We depend on distribution partners.
We market and sell our insurance products through independent, non-employee distribution partners.  Independent distribution partners have – and we expect they will continue to have – a significant role in overall insurance industry premium production.  While our customers find advantages in using independent distribution partners, our reliance on independent distribution partners presents risks and challenges, including:
•
Competition in our distribution channel, as we must market our products and services to independent distribution partners who can access multiple carriers and markets. 
•
Brand recognition challenges because we closely coordinate marketing with our distribution partners and some customers do not differentiate their insurance agent from their insurer.
•
Our market share growth is tied to our distribution partners' market share.  Consequently, growth in our Standard Personal Lines could be more limited than in our Standard Commercial Lines.  Competitors have focused on lower-cost "direct-to-customer" distribution models emphasizing digital ease and efficiencies to grow standard personal lines business market share.  Continued advancements in "direct-to-customer" distribution models may impact our independent distribution partners' overall market share, make it more difficult for us to grow, or require us to establish relationships with more distribution partners.
•
Aggregation and consolidation of our independent distribution partners and their market share.  Some publicly traded and private equity-backed independent distribution partners have deployed consolidation strategies to acquire other independent distribution partners and increase their market share ("Aggregators") over the last decade.  If more of our independent distribution partners become Aggregators or Aggregators acquire them, Aggregator demands and influence on our business could increase.  For example, Aggregators could develop and implement strategies to consolidate their business with fewer insurers and demand higher base and supplemental commissions.  Aggregators accounted for approximately 46% of our DPW at December 31, 2024, up from 36% three years ago.  No one distribution partner is responsible for 10% or more of our combined insurance operations' premium.
Our financial condition and results of operations are impacted by our independent distribution partners' success in marketing and selling our products and services.
National and global economic conditions could adversely and materially affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth.
Unfavorable economic developments, such as a decline in economic growth or increased inflation levels, could adversely affect our earnings if our policyholders need less insurance coverage, cancel existing insurance policies, modify coverage, or choose not to renew with us.  Inflation could significantly impact our claims severity across multiple lines of business and could result in adverse reserve development.  An economic downturn could also lead to increased credit and premium receivable risk, failure of reinsurance counterparties and other financial institutions, limits on our ability to issue new debt, reduced liquidity, and declines in our investments' fair value and financial strength ratings.  These potential events and other economic factors could adversely and materially affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth.  During 2024, 25% of DPW in our Standard Commercial Lines business was based on payroll or sales of our underlying policyholders.  An economic downturn in which our policyholders have declining revenue or employee count could adversely affect our total written premium, including audit and endorsement premium.
We write business domestically in the United States, and our insurance operations do not have direct exposure to businesses or individuals in Russia, Ukraine, and the Middle East.  We do not have material exposure to investments subject to embargoes or Russian reinsurance counterparties.  However, ongoing wars and conflicts continue to impact global economic, banking, commodity, and financial markets by exacerbating ongoing economic challenges, including inflation and supply chain disruption, which influence insurance loss costs, premiums, and investment valuation.
A downgrade or a potential downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could result in a loss of business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
A significant financial strength rating downgrade, particularly from AM Best Company ("AM Best"), would affect our ability to write new or renewal business.  Most policyholders are required by various third-party agreements, primarily with lenders, to maintain insurance policies from a carrier with a minimum rating from AM Best or Standard & Poor's Global Ratings.  Credit rating downgrades could also make it more expensive to access capital markets.  We cannot predict rating actions issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations that might adversely affect our business or potential responses.  Any significant downgrade in our financial strength and credit ratings below an "A-" could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings.  For additional information on our

current financial strength and credit ratings, refer to "Overview" in Item 1. "Business." of this Form 10-K.
Markets for insurance products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and we may be unable to compete effectively.
We offer our insurance products and services in a highly competitive market characterized by (i) consumer and business price sensitivity and (ii) aggressive price competition and improvements based on performance characteristics and large data sets.  These factors can compact underwriting margins, new products and services, evolving industry standards, and rapid adoption of technological advancements.  Our ability to compete depends heavily on our timely and consistent introduction of innovative new products and services.
We face substantial competition from a wide range of property and casualty insurance companies for customers, distribution partners, and employees.  Competitors include public, private, and mutual insurance companies.  Many competitors are larger and may have lower relative operating costs, lower capital costs, or greater capacity to absorb or diversify more risk while maintaining their financial strength ratings.  Other competitors, such as mutual or reciprocal companies, are owned by or operated cooperatively for insureds and, unlike us, do not have shareholders who evaluate return on equity performance.  Consequently, some competitors may be able to price their products more competitively. 
The Internet has emerged as a significant competitive digital marketplace for existing and new competitors.  Established insurance competitors are beginning to explore broader digital Internet offerings and implement artificial intelligence ("AI").  New competitors with variations on traditional business models have emerged.  Because the Internet makes it easier and less expensive to bundle products and services, it is also possible that non-insurance companies conducting business on the Internet could enter the insurance business or form strategic alliances with insurers.  Changes in competitors and competition, particularly on the Internet, could cause changes in the supply or demand for insurance and adversely affect our business.
The increasing importance of the Internet, technology, AI, and digital strategies in our industry also demands that we attract and retain employees in difficult-to-fill data science, advanced analytics, and information technology ("IT") roles.  If we cannot attract and retain such employees, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
We have less loss experience data than our larger competitors.
Insurers depend on access to reliable data about their policyholders and loss experience to build complex analytics and predictive models that assess risk profitability, reserve adequacy, adverse claim development potential, recovery opportunities, fraudulent activities, and customer buying habits.  Because we use and depend on the aggregated industry loss data assembled by rating bureaus under the antitrust exemptions of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, we likely would be at a competitive disadvantage to larger insurers if Congress repealed the McCarran-Ferguson Act.
We expect the importance of data science and analytics to increase, becoming more complex and accurate with larger sets of relevant data.  Some larger competitors have significantly more data about the performance of their underwritten risks.  In comparison, we may not have sufficient volumes of loss experience data to accurately and granularly analyze and project our future costs.  We supplement our data with industry loss experience from Verisk, American Association of Insurance Services, Inc., the National Council on Compensation Insurance, Inc., and other publicly available sources.  While relevant, industry data may not correlate specifically to the performance of our underwritten risks or be as predictive as data on a larger book of our own business.

We are subject to various modeling risks that could have a material adverse impact on our business results.
We rely on complex financial and other statistical models, developed internally and by third parties, to predict (i) underwriting results on individual risks and our overall portfolio, (ii) claims fraud and other claims impacts, such as escalation, (iii) impacts from catastrophes, (iv) enterprise risk management capital scenarios, and (v) investment portfolio changes.  We rely on these financial and other statistical models to analyze historical loss costs and pricing, claims severity and frequency trends, catastrophe losses, reinsurance attachment and exhaustion points, investment performance, portfolio risk, and our economic capital position.  Flaws or limitations in financial and statistical models and their embedded assumptions could increase losses.  For example, a significant component of climate change risk is that the frequency and severity of extreme weather events may evolve differently relative to historical levels – leading to greater model uncertainty.  In addition, increasing insurance regulatory interest in data and model use, combined with any potential restrictions on traditional rating factors or model use, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.  Our statistical models are extremely useful in monitoring and controlling risk, but are no substitute for senior management's experience or judgment.

Risks Related to Our Investments Segment

Our investments are exposed to credit risk, interest rate fluctuation, and changes in value.
We depend on income from our investment portfolio for a significant portion of our revenue and earnings.  Our investments can be negatively affected by (i) liquidity, (ii) credit deterioration, (iii) financial results, (iv) public equity and/or debt market changes, (v) economic conditions, including heightened levels of economic inflation, (vi) political risk, (vii) sovereign risk, (viii) interest rate fluctuations, or (ix) other factors, including civil unrest and other catastrophic events, some of which may be impacted by climate change risk.
Our investment portfolio's value is subject to credit risk from our held securities' issuers, guarantors, financial guarantee insurers, and other counterparties in certain transactions.  Defaults on any of our investments by any of these parties could reduce our net investment income and increase net realized investment losses.  We are subject to the risk that the issuers or guarantors of our fixed income securities may default on principal and interest payment obligations.
Additionally, we are exposed to interest rate risk, primarily related to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in interest rates.  Consequently, the amount of our cash and cash equivalents and the value and liquidity of our marketable and non-marketable securities may fluctuate substantially.  Future fluctuations in the value of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities could result in significant losses that have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results
.
Our investment portfolio is exposed to climate change-related transition and physical investment risks.
•
Transition risks arise from the world’s transition to a low-carbon economy, driven by government policy and regulation, advances in low-carbon technology, and shifting societal preferences and public sentiment.  This transition to renewable energy sources may lead to (i) stranded assets in sectors with high carbon footprints or those closely tied to carbon-based economic activity, such as the fossil fuel and automotive industries, (ii) increased costs for infrastructure reinvestment and replacement, and litigation defense of carbon-intensive sectors, (iii) lower corporate profitability, (iv) lower property values, and (v) lower household wealth.  The Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment defines the carbon-intensive sectors as the most exposed to transition risk:  oil and gas, coal, power, automotive, cement, aviation, and steel.  Carbon-intensive sectors within our fixed income securities portfolio represented about 5% and 4% of our total invested assets as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.
•
Physical investment risks include the risk of investment losses on our commercial and residential mortgage-backed securities exposed to climate-related catastrophic losses that can cause business disruption, destroy capital, increase costs to recover from disasters, reduce revenue, and cause population displacement and migration.  These, in turn, can lower residential and commercial property values, household wealth, and corporate profitability, potentially creating financial and credit market losses impacting insurer asset values.  As of December 31, 2024, about 69% of our residential mortgage-backed securities were backed by government agencies.  We generally invest in the top tranches of commercial mortgage-backed securities, which limit potential losses from property value declines.  As of December 31, 2024, about 68% of our commercial mortgage-backed securities had "AAA" credit ratings.
Significant future investment value declines could require further losses recorded on securities we sell and credit losses.  For more information regarding market interest rate, credit, and equity price risk, see Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk." of this Form 10-K.
We are subject to the risks inherent in investing in private limited partnerships.
Our alternative investments include private limited partnerships that invest in various strategies, such as private equity, private credit, and real assets.  The primary assets and liabilities underlying these limited partnership investments generally do not have quoted prices in active markets for the same or similar assets.  Consequently, their valuation is subject to a higher level of subjectivity and unobservable inputs than most of our other investments.  We record these limited partnership investments under the equity method of accounting, so valuation decreases could negatively impact our results of operations.
Determining the amount of credit losses taken on our investments is highly subjective and could materially impact our results of operations or our financial position.
The determination of the amount of credit losses taken on our investments is based on our quarterly evaluation and assessment of our investments and known and inherent risks associated with the various asset classes.  Our allowance for credit losses is subject to significant judgments and assumptions about changes in economic conditions, estimated future cash flows, and the 
29

accuracy of third-party information used in internal assessments. We revise our evaluations and assessments as conditions change and new information becomes available.  There can be no assurance that management has accurately assessed the level of credit losses recorded in our Financial Statements.  For further details on our evaluation and considerations for determining whether a security has a credit loss, please refer to "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" in Item 7. "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." of this Form 10-K.

Changes to laws and regulations can adversely affect our business by increasing our costs, limiting our ability to offer a product or service to customers, requiring changes to our business practices, or otherwise making our products and services less attractive.
While we underwrite risks only in the U.S., international regulatory developments, primarily capital adequacy and risk management requirements in the European Union ("EU"), may influence U.S. regulators as they develop or revise domestic regulatory standards.
We have designed and implemented policies and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations.  However, we cannot provide assurance that our employees, contractors, or independent distribution partners will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies and procedures.  To some degree, we have multiple regulators whose authority may overlap and may have different interpretations and/or regulations related to the same legal issues.  Consequently, we have the risk that one regulator's position or interpretation may conflict with another regulator on the same point.  For example, i
f Congress passed legislation regulating insurer solvency oversight and state regulators remained responsible for rate approval, we could be subject to a conflicting regulatory framework that could impact our profitability and capital adequacy.  
The cost of complying with various laws and regulations, potentially conflicting laws and regulations, and changes in those laws and regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings.
Insurers are subject to regulatory, political, and media scrutiny.  We are subject to government market conduct reviews and investigations, legal actions, and penalties.  There can be no assurance that our business will not be materially adversely

affected by the outcomes of such activity in the future.  If we are found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.
Our business is subject to various state, federal, and other laws, rules, policies, and other data use and protection obligations.
We are subject to federal and state laws relating to collecting, using, retaining, securing, and transferring personally identifiable information ("PII").  Federal laws include 
the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Drivers Privacy Protection Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and Unfair and Deceptive Acts and Practices laws. 
 Several states, like New York, Nevada, Colorado, Virginia, and California, have passed similar laws, and others are considering imposing additional restrictions or creating new rights concerning PII.  These laws continue to develop and may differ by jurisdiction.  Complying with emerging and changing requirements may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices.  Noncompliance could result in significant reputational harm, penalties, and legal liability.
General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") regulates data protection and privacy in the EU and personal data transfers outside the EU.  GDPR’s main tenet is to give individuals primary control over their personal data.  Because we do not write coverages in the EU, GDPR does not directly impact us.  Some U.S. states have subsequently incorporated individual-control mechanisms into state privacy laws.  Future EU data privacy actions likely will influence U.S. regulators over time.
We make statements about our use and disclosure of PII in our privacy notice, published on our website, and in other public venues.  We could be subject to litigation or governmental actions if we fail to comply with these public statements or federal and state privacy-related and data protection laws and regulations.  Such proceedings could impact our reputation and result in penalties, including ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.

We are engaged in ordinary routine legal proceedings incidental to our insurance operations that are inherently unpredictable and could impact our reputation and/or have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.
We are engaged in ordinary routine legal proceedings incidental to our insurance operations that include:
•
Indemnity or defense of third-party suits brought against our insureds;
•
Defense of actions brought against us by our insureds who disagree with our coverage decisions, some of which allege bad faith claims handling and seek extra-contractual damages, punitive damages, or other penalties;
•
Actions we file, primarily for declaratory judgment, seeking confirmation that we have made appropriate coverage decisions under our insurance contracts;
•
Actions brought against competitors or us by plaintiffs alleging improper business practices and sometimes seeking class status.  Such actions historically have included issues and allegations, without limitation, related to (i) unfairly discriminatory underwriting practices, including the impact of credit score usage, (ii) managed care practices, such as provider reimbursement, and (iii) automobile claims practices; and
•
Actions we file against third parties and other insurers for subrogation and recovery of other amounts we paid on our insureds' behalf.
Some of our legal proceedings may receive media attention because of their perceived newsworthiness and/or relationship to various broad economic, political, social, and legal developments or trends.  Such media stories could negatively impact our reputation.
We expect any potential ultimate liability for ordinary routine legal proceedings incidental to our insurance business will not be material to our consolidated financial condition after considering estimated loss provisions.  Litigation outcomes are inherently unpredictable, even with meritorious defenses.  The same is true with case-specific litigation duration, as state dockets are often overcrowded.  Generally, the longer a case is in litigation, the more expensive it can become.  Because the amounts sought in specific actions are large or indeterminate, any adverse outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.
We have no material litigation risks related to climate change.
Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure and Governance
We are a holding company, and our ability to declare dividends to our shareholders, pay indebtedness, and enter into affiliate transactions may be limited because our Insurance Subsidiaries are regulated.
Restrictions on our Insurance Subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends, make loans or advances to the Parent, or enter into 
31

transactions with affiliates may materially affect our ability to pay dividends on our preferred and common stock or repay our indebtedness.  Based on these restrictions, there is a maximum ordinary annual dividend amount the Insurance Subsidiaries can provide the Parent.  Our Insurance Subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends or make loans or advances is subject to the approval or review of our domiciliary state insurance regulators.  For additional details regarding dividend restrictions, see Note 22. "Statutory Financial Information, Capital Requirements, and Restrictions on Dividends and Transfers of Funds" in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." of this Form 10-K.
The Parent’s ability to pay dividends to its stockholders is also impacted by covenants in its credit agreement (the "Line of Credit") among the Parent, the named lenders (the "Lenders"), and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent.  These covenants obligate the Parent to, among other things, maintain a minimum consolidated net worth and a maximum ratio of debt to capitalization.  Our preferred stock's terms limit the Parent's ability to declare or pay dividends on, or purchase, redeem, or otherwise acquire shares of its common stock or any shares of the Parent that rank junior to, or on parity with, the preferred stock if the Parent does not declare and pay (or set aside) dividends on the preferred stock for the last preceding dividend period.  For additional details about the Line of Credit's financial covenants, see Note 11. "Indebtedness" in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K.  For additional details about conditions related to our preferred stock, see Note 17. "Equity" in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K.
Because we are a New Jersey corporation and an insurance holding company, we may be less attractive to potential acquirers and our common stock's value could be adversely affected.
We are a New Jersey company, and provisions of the New Jersey Shareholders' Protection Act and our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation may discourage, delay, or prevent us from being acquired.  A supermajority of our shareholders must approve (i) certain business combinations with interested shareholders or (ii) any amendment to the related provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation unless certain conditions are met.  These conditions may relate to, among other things, the interested stockholder's acquisition of stock, the approval of the business combination by disinterested members of our Board and disinterested stockholders, and the price and payment of the consideration proposed in the business combination.  In addition to considering the effects of any action on our shareholders (including any offer or proposal to acquire the Parent), our Board may consider (i) the long-term, and short-term interests of the Parent and our shareholders, including the possibility that the Parent’s continued independence may best serve these interests, (ii) the effects of the action on the Parent's employees, suppliers, creditors, and customers, and (iii) the effects of the action on the community in which the Parent operates.
These provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and New Jersey law could (i) deprive our common shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium over the prevailing market price in a hostile takeover and (ii) adversely affect the value of our common stock.
Because we own insurance subsidiaries, any party seeking to acquire 10% or more of our common stock must seek prior approval from the subsidiaries' domiciliary insurance regulators and file extensive information about their business operations and finances.  The New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance Commissioner, who regulates seven of our Insurance Subsidiaries, also considers whether (i) the acquisition of control of an insurer would be adverse to the public interest or the protection of existing and future policyholders or (ii) persons seeking control would use control adversely to the public interest or the protection of policyholders.
Risks Related to Our General Operations
We and our distribution partners and vendors are subject to attempted cyber-attacks and other cybersecurity and system availability risks.
Our business heavily relies on IT and application systems connected to or accessed through a connection to the Internet.  Consequently, a malicious cyber-attack could affect us.  Our systems also house proprietary and confidential information about our operations, employees, agents, and customers and their employees and property, including PII.  A malicious cyber-attack on (i) our systems, (ii) our distribution partners or their key operating systems, and (iii) any other of our third-party partners or vendors and their key operating systems may interrupt our operations, damage our reputation and result in monetary damages that are difficult to quantify.  These potential impacts from a malicious cyber-attack could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings.
Through encryption and authentication technologies, we have implemented system- and process-based risk mitigations intended to secure our IT systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data.  Cyber-attack sophistication evolves daily, so our security measures may not sufficiently address all eventualities.  We may be vulnerable to hacking, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management, or other irregularities.  We implement new technologies, including artificial intelligence, to increase operational efficiencies.  These new technologies may increase the risk of cyber-attacks.  We also rely on third-party technology providers whose cyber-attack risks may be higher or lower than ours depending on their

profile and security program's maturity.  To the extent possible and practical, we review third-party control environments, aligning the risk exposure with our business requirements and risk tolerances.  Any disruption or breach of our systems or data security could damage our reputation, result in monetary damages that are difficult to estimate, and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings.  To mitigate this risk, we have and expect to continue to (i) conduct disaster recovery exercises, employee education programs and tabletop exercises and (ii) develop and invest in a variety of controls to prevent, detect, and appropriately react to cyber-attacks, including frequently testing our systems' security and access controls.  We have insurance coverage for certain cybersecurity risks, including privacy breach incidents, which may be insufficient to indemnify against all arising losses or types of claims.
In addition to the risk of cyber-attacks, we face system availability risk.  Our business relies heavily on various IT and application systems.  We have robust business continuity plans designed to minimize the duration and impact of an unexpected loss of availability of any of these systems.  Nevertheless, we could experience an event that impacts one or more of these systems, including those based in facilities where our vendors or we operate.  Such events could interrupt our ability to conduct business and negatively impact our results of operations, despite our business continuity plans.
Operational leverage necessitates the success of our risk management strategies, and their failure could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
As an insurer, we assume risk from our policyholders.  We define operating leverage as the ratio of NPW to our statutory surplus.  We balance and mitigate our operational leverage risk with several risk management strategies within our insurance operations to achieve a balance of growth and profit, including an underwriting risk appetite focused on small-to-medium-sized accounts.  We employ significant reinsurance, a disciplined reserving approach, and a conservative investment philosophy.  These strategies have inherent limitations.  We cannot be certain that an event or series of unanticipated events will not occur and result in greater than expected losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings.

Risk Management and Strategy
Our business heavily relies on various IT and application systems that contain proprietary and confidential information about our operations, employees, agents, claimants, customers, and their employees and property, including personally identifiable information.  These systems are connected to and/or accessed from the Internet, making them susceptible to cyber-attacks.  
A cyber-attack on our systems, distribution partners and their key operating systems, or any other third-party partners or vendors and their key operating systems may materially affect us.  Potential impacts include prolonged interruption of our business operations, reputational harm, or substantial monetary damages.  For a detailed description of the risks related to cybersecurity, refer to the "Risks Related to our General Operations" section in Item 1A. "Risk Factors." of this Form 10-K.
We have a dedicated unit, led by the Senior Vice President ("SVP") of IT Enterprise Strategy and Execution, to implement cybersecurity controls, assess and report on cybersecurity risks, and consult with our ERM unit, which is responsible for identifying, measuring, monitoring, and reporting on key enterprise-wide risks, including cybersecurity risks.

We work with industry-leading security consulting and technology partners and employ a "defense-in-depth" approach that uses multiple security measures to protect the integrity of our proprietary and confidential information.  This approach aligns with the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cyber Security Framework and provides preventative, detective, and responsive measures to identify and manage risks.  We periodically review our strategy and modify its implementation based on threat trends, program maturity, assessment results, and the advice of third-party security consultants.
  We have documented information security policies, procedures, and guidelines, known as our "Written Information Security Program."  Our program (i) balances responsiveness to rapidly changing threats with ensuring our IT security environment's sustainability and overall effectiveness and (ii) is reasonably likely to defend against risks of cybersecurity threats that would have a material impact on our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.  This program focuses on the following six key areas to monitor various IT performance and security metrics:
•
Proactive cybersecurity processes, including vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and periodic program assessments by outside security consultants and assessors;
33

Contents
•
Reactive cybersecurity processes that we regularly evaluate using incident response and disaster recovery exercises based on realistic scenarios;
•
Endpoint technology that includes encryption, threat management, monitoring, investigation support, and backups;
•
Identity and access management controls that often include multi-factor authentication and additional safeguards for staff granted elevated privileges;
•
Employee cyber risk awareness, training, and testing that covers cybersecurity threats and actions to prevent or report attacks; and
•
Third-party risk management and security standards, including due diligence, continuous monitoring, cyber risk scoring, and contractual obligations.  We review third-party control environments when possible and practical, aligning the risk exposure with our business requirements and risk tolerances.
Board Governance and Management
The Executive Vice President ("EVP") & Chief Information Officer ("CIO") and the SVP of Enterprise Strategy and Execution provide quarterly written and in-person updates on the strength of our cyber risk control environment, emerging cyber threat issues, and the results of external assessments by outside security consultants and assessors to the Board’s Risk Committee.
  The Board's Risk Committee oversees our ERM framework and practices and assists the Board in overseeing our operational activities, including the Company's information technology security program, and identifying and reviewing related risks.

The cybersecurity team, managed by the SVP of IT Enterprise Strategy and Execution, (i) receives oversight and executive support through engagement with our ERC, which is responsible for the holistic evaluation, management, and supervision of our aggregate risk profile and (ii) collaborates with our ERM function on business alignment and cybersecurity insurance procurement.
The expertise of key members of management and our committees responsible for assessing, managing, and presenting quarterly updates to the Board’s Risk Committee about our cybersecurity risks is summarized as follows:
•
John Bresney, EVP & CIO, reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer and is responsible for all of our IT operations, including oversight of the SVP of Enterprise Strategy and Execution’s implementation of our cybersecurity program and enforcement of our cybersecurity policies.  He has worked for us for approximately 31 years, holding various technology and information security roles of increasing responsibility.  He has a bachelor’s degree in information systems and business, a Master’s Certificate in Project Management, and a Columbia University CIO Program Certificate.
•
Robert McKenna, SVP of Enterprise Strategy and Execution, reports to our CIO and leads the implementation of our cybersecurity program, enforcement of our cybersecurity policies, technology planning, projects driving IT strategy, and enterprise IT risk management.  He also oversees cybersecurity incidents under our Security Incident Response Plan ("IRP").  He has worked for us for approximately 22 years in related positions of increasing responsibility and has over 28 years of technology and information security experience.  He has a master’s degree in business administration, a Certificate in Project Management, and is a Certified Insurance Counselor.
•
Christopher Cunniff, SVP and CRO, reports to our Chief Financial Officer, leads our Reinsurance and ERM teams, and chairs the ERC and the Market Security Committee.  He has worked for us for approximately seven years, and he previously was our SVP of Actuarial Reserving.  He has over 33 years of insurance industry experience, serving in various key leadership positions.  He has a bachelor’s degree in mathematics, is a fellow of the Casualty Actuarial Society, and is a member of the American Academy of Actuaries.
Our IRP describes the circumstances that require internal and external notifications of cybersecurity incidents that (i) relate to any of our computer systems or networks and compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the systems or networks, (ii) compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of any sensitive data that belongs to us or a third party and is in our care or custody, or (iii) involve one or more third parties with whom we share sensitive data.  It describes the (i) involvement of the SVP of Enterprise Strategy and Execution, (ii) escalation process of such incidents to senior management,

including the General Counsel, CIO, Chief Financial Officer, CRO, and Chief Executive Officer, (iii) reporting process to the Risk Committee and Board, and (iv) the notification and disclosure process to customers, distribution partners, regulators, and the SEC.  The IRP also provides guidance on how to evaluate potential cyber events and suspicious cyber occurrences.  We engage outside legal counsel and technical experts to regularly review the IRP and use internal teams and outside advisors with specialized skills to support the response and recovery efforts of proprietary and confidential information.

For additional information on our overall corporate governance structure and internal process of assessing our other significant risks, see the "Corporate Governance, Sustainability and Social Responsibility" section in Item 1. "Business." of this Form 10-K.
