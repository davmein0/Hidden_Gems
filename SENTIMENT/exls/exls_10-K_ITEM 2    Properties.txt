ITEM 2.    Properties
Our corporate headquarters are located in New York. We have multiple operations centers spread across India, the Philippines, South Africa, Columbia, Bulgaria, Romania, the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic, Mexico and the Republic of Ireland with an aggregate area of approximately 1,810,000 square feet and a current installed capacity of approximately 28,000 workstations, including workstations for training and our employees in enabling functions. We also have multiple operations centers and regional offices in the United States.
Our corporate headquarters and all of our operations centers are leased under long-term leases with varying expiration dates, except for an operations center in Pune, India with an area of 86,361 sq. ft. and containing approximately 1,690 agent workstations, which we own. Substantially all of our owned and leased property is used to service all of our reporting segments. 
We believe that our current facilities are adequate to support our existing operations, however we continue to optimize our existing network of operations centers to service our client, drive efficiencies and adapting the hybrid working model. We also believe that we will be able to obtain suitable additional facilities on commercially reasonable terms on an “as needed basis”.
