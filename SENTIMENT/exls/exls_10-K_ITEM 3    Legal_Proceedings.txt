Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

On October 5, 2021, our board of directors authorized a $300 million (excluding excise tax) common stock repurchase program beginning January 1, 2022 (the “2022 Repurchase Program”).
On February 26, 2024, our board of directors authorized a $500 million (excluding excise tax) common stock repurchase program beginning March 1, 2024 (the “2024 Repurchase Program”), and terminated the 2022 Repurchase Program on February 29, 2024.
Under these two repurchase programs, shares may be purchased by us from time to time from the open market and through private transactions, or otherwise, as determined by our management as market conditions warrant. We have structured open market purchases under our two repurchase programs to comply with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. Repurchases may be discontinued at any time by management. Repurchased shares are recorded as treasury shares and are held until our board of directors designates that these shares be retired or used for other purposes.
During the three months ended December 31, 2024, purchases of common stock were as follows:

Performance Graph
The following graph compares the cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock with the cumulative total return of the Nasdaq 100 Index (capitalization weighted) and our peer group of companies for the period beginning December 31, 2019. Our peer group of companies is comprised of two companies that we believe are our closest reporting issuer competitors: Genpact Limited and WNS (Holdings) Limited. The returns of the component entities of our peer group index are weighted according to the market capitalization of each company as of the beginning of each period for which a return is presented. The returns assume that $100 was invested on December 31, 2019 and that all dividends were reinvested. The stock performance shown on the graph below is not indicative of future price performance.

Executive Overview
We are a global data and artificial intelligence (“AI”) company that offers services and solutions to reinvent our client business models, drive better outcomes and unlock growth with speed. We harness the power of data, AI, and deep industry knowledge to transform businesses, including the world’s leading corporations in industries including insurance, healthcare, banking and capital markets, retail, communications and media, and energy and infrastructure, among others.
We deliver advanced analytics and AI-powered digital operations and solutions to our clients, driving enterprise-scale business transformation initiatives that leverage our deep domain expertise in generative AI and cloud technology. Through the end of 2024, we managed and reported financial information through our four strategic business units: Insurance, Healthcare, Analytics and Emerging Business, which reflected how management reviewed financial information and made operating decisions.
Our global delivery network, which includes highly trained industry and process specialists across the United States, the United Kingdom, Latin America, South Africa, Europe and Asia (primarily India and the Philippines), is a key asset. We have operations centers in India, the United States, the Philippines, South Africa, Colombia, Bulgaria, Romania, the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic, Mexico and the Republic of Ireland.
Acquisition during the year

2024
On August 1, 2024, we completed the acquisition of Incandescent Technologies, Inc. (“ITI Data”), a data management solutions firm that works with the global banks, financial services and healthcare companies. It delivers enterprise business solutions for clients processing significant data volumes with complex data management requirements. The acquisition strengthens our ability to deliver reliable, data-driven insights to our clients and ultimately drive greater value and innovation across their operations.

2025 Operating Model
In the first quarter of 2025, we began to implement operational and structural changes to accelerate the execution of our data and AI strategy, capture a greater share of the growing AI market and drive our long-term growth. The new operating model is comprised of Industry Market Units (“IMUs”) to focus on delivering higher value to clients leveraging our full suite of capabilities; and Strategic Growth Units to focus on rapidly advancing our capabilities specific to various industries and client needs. This will enable us to further embed analytics throughout each of our IMUs, enhance our client relationships, deepen investments in data and AI capabilities, develop industry-specific AI solutions, form partnerships, access new client buying centers, enable expansion of our addressable markets across industries and geographies, and provide more professional development opportunities for our employees.
Our IMUs, Insurance, Healthcare and Life Sciences, Banking, Capital Markets and Diversified Industries, and International Growth Markets, reflect how management will review financial information and make operating decisions beginning in the first quarter of 2025. These IMUs will focus on managing customer relationships and delivering the “One EXL” value proposition to clients, maintain a unified go-to-market approach and be integrally responsible for growth, profitability and client satisfaction.
Our new reportable segments, aligned to our IMUs, effective for the first quarter of 2025 will be as follows:
•
Insurance,
•
Healthcare and Life Sciences,
•
Banking, Capital Markets and Diversified Industries,
•
International Growth Markets
The primary changes in our new reportable segments reflect 1) the integration of our former Analytics reportable segment as a core capability within each of our IMUs, ensuring alignment with the specialized needs of our clients across IMUs, 2) the reorganization of our former Emerging Business reportable segment into a Banking, Capital Markets and Diversified Industries reportable segment, excluding Life Sciences, which is now a part of former Healthcare reportable segment, and including data and analytics services, and 3) the formation of International Growth Markets as a separate business unit to represent all our service and solutions offerings to clients in the United Kingdom, Europe, Middle East and Asia-Pacific geographies across all industry verticals. The International Growth Markets business unit will help strategically expand our footprint in markets outside of Americas and drive focus on offerings and expansion in those markets in new and existing clients.
This change in segment presentation will not have any effect on our consolidated statements of income, balance sheets or statements of cash flows. The revised presentation will be reflected in our periodic and annual reports beginning in the first quarter of 2025.
Our Business
We provide data analytics and digital operations and solutions to our clients. We market and sell our services to existing and prospective clients through our sales and client management teams, which are aligned by our clients’ industry verticals and our capabilities such as digital operations and solutions and analytics. Our sales and client management teams operate primarily from the United States, India, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Australia.

Table of Contents
Digital Operations and Solutions: We provide our clients with a range of data and AI-driven digital operations and solutions include: a) multi-modal data ingestion using AI, and converting unstructured content into curated and usable data, b) real-time and comprehensive data insights with end-to-end data management and 360-degree customer views for our clients, c) omni-channel and frictionless customer experience including self-service, conversational AI and smart agent assist, d) AI-powered automation of transaction processing and e) automated quality, compliance and audits. We have transformed various client operations using the above solutions such as underwriting operations, claims processing, accounts payables processing, utilization management, member and provider contact center services and collections and accounts receivable. We manage and digitally transform these operations for our clients by deploying our solutions through a software-as-a-service model via our partners’ cloud network or a client’s on-cloud deployment model, to digitally transform their retained operations. For a portion of our digital operations and solutions, we hire and train employees to work at our operations centers on the relevant business operations, implement a process migration to these operations centers and then provide services either to the client or directly to the client’s customers. Each client contract has different terms based on the scope, deliverables and complexity of the engagement. We also provide consulting services related to digital operations and solutions that include industry-specific digital transformational services as well as cross-industry finance and accounting services as part of the Emerging Business strategic business unit.
We provide our services under contracts with our clients, which typically have terms of three or more years, with some being contracts with no end dates. These contracts provide us with a relatively predictable revenue base for a substantial portion of our digital operations and solutions business. However, our clients can typically terminate these contracts with or without cause and with short notice periods. We have a long selling cycle for our services and the budget and approval processes of prospective clients make it difficult to predict the timing of entering into definitive agreements with new clients. Similarly, new license sales and implementation projects for our technology service platforms and other software-based services have a long selling cycle, however ongoing annual maintenance and support contracts for existing arrangements provide us with a relatively predictable revenue base.
We charge for our services using various pricing models like time-and-material pricing, full-time-equivalent pricing, transaction-based pricing, outcome-based pricing, subscription-based pricing and other alternative pricing models. Outcome-based pricing arrangements are examples of non-linear pricing models where clients link revenues from platforms and solutions and the services we provide to usage or savings rather than the efforts deployed to provide these services. We continue to observe a shift in the industry pricing models toward transaction-based pricing, outcome-based pricing and other alternative pricing models. We believe this trend will continue and we use such alternative pricing models with some of our current clients and are seeking to move certain other clients from a full-time-equivalent pricing model to a transaction-based or other alternative pricing model. These alternative pricing models place the focus on operating efficiency in order to maintain or improve our gross margins.
We have also observed that prospective larger clients are entering into multi-vendor relationships with regard to their digital operations and solutions needs, in order to achieve more favorable contract terms and diversification of the risk of concentration on a few vendors. We believe that the trend toward multi-vendor relationships will continue. A multi-vendor relationship allows a client to seek more favorable pricing and other contract terms from each vendor, which can result in significantly reduced gross margins from the provision of services to such client for each vendor. To the extent our large clients expand their use of multi-vendor relationships and are able to extract more favorable contract terms from other vendors, our gross margins and revenues may be reduced with regard to such clients, particularly if we are required to modify the terms of our relationships with such clients to meet competition.

Analytics: Our analytics services aim to drive better business outcomes for our clients by unlocking deep insights from data and creating data and AI-led solutions across all aspects of our clients’ business. We provide care optimization and payment integrity services for our clients through our healthcare analytics solutions and services. We also offer integrated solutions to help our clients in cost containment by leveraging technology platforms, customizable and configurable analytics and expertise in healthcare reimbursements to help clients enhance their claim payment accuracy. Our Analytics teams deliver predictive and prescriptive analytics in the areas of customer acquisition and life cycle management, risk underwriting and pricing, operational effectiveness, credit and operational risk monitoring and governance, regulatory reporting and data management. We enhance, modernize and enrich structured and unstructured data and use a spectrum of advanced analytical tools and techniques, including our in-house and third-party AI, generative AI, and ML capabilities and proprietary solutions to create insights, improve decision making for our clients and address a range of complex industry-wide priorities. We actively cross-sell and, where appropriate, integrate our analytics services with other digital operations and solutions as part of a comprehensive offering for our clients. Our project-based analytics services are cyclical and can be significantly affected by variations in business cycles. In addition, our project-based analytics services are documented in contracts with terms generally not exceeding one year and may not produce ongoing or recurring business for us once the project is completed. These contracts also usually contain provisions permitting termination of the contract after a short notice period. The short-term nature and specificity of these projects could lead to fluctuations and uncertainties in the revenues generated from providing analytics services.
We anticipate that revenues from our analytics services will grow as we expand our offerings, client base and go-to-market strategy, both organically and through acquisitions.
Revenues
For fiscal 2024, we generated revenues of $1,838.4 million compared to revenues of $1,630.7 million for fiscal 2023, an increase of $207.7 million, or 12.7%.
We serve clients mainly in the United States and the United Kingdom, with these two regions generating 82.6% and 11.7%, respectively, of our total revenues for fiscal 2024 and 84.1% and 10.9%, respectively, of our total revenues for fiscal 2023.
For fiscal 2024 and 2023, our total revenues from our top ten clients accounted for 33.2% and 34.0% of our total revenues, respectively. Although we continue to develop relationships with new clients to diversify our client base, we believe that the loss of any of our top ten clients could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.
Cost of Revenues
Our cost of revenues primarily consists of:
•
employee costs, which include salary, bonus and other compensation expenses; retirement benefits, recruitment and training costs; employee health and life insurance; transport; rewards and recognition for certain employees; and non-cash stock-based compensation expense; outsourced/subcontractors costs;
•
costs relating to our facilities and communications network, which include telecommunication and IT costs; facilities and customer management support; operational expenses for our operations centers; lease cost; and
•
other costs which primarily include travel and costs relating to our direct mail operations.
The most significant components of our cost of revenues are salaries and benefits (including stock-based compensation), retirement benefits, recruitment, training, transport, meals, rewards and recognition and employee health and life insurance. Salary levels, employee turnover rates and our ability to efficiently manage and utilize our employees significantly affect our cost of revenues. We make every effort to manage employee and capacity utilization and continuously monitor service levels and staffing requirements. Although we generally have been able to reallocate our employees as client demand has fluctuated, a contract termination or significant reduction in work assigned to us by a major client could cause us to experience a higher-than-expected number of unassigned employees, which would increase our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues until we are able to reduce or reallocate our headcount. A significant increase in the turnover rate among our employees, particularly among the highly skilled workforce needed to execute certain services, would increase our recruiting and training costs and decrease our operating efficiency, productivity and profit margins. In addition, cost of revenues also includes non-cash amortization of stock-based compensation expense related to the grant of our equity awards to employees directly involved in providing services to our clients.
We expect our cost of revenues to continue to increase as we continue to add professionals in our operations centers globally to service additional business and as wages continue to increase globally. In particular, we expect recruitment and 
33
Table of Contents
training costs to continue to increase as we hire additional staff to service new clients and train existing staff to provide them with evolving skill sets. There is significant competition for professionals with skills necessary to perform the services we offer to our clients. As our existing competitors continue to grow, and as new competitors enter the market, we expect competition for skilled professionals in each of these areas to continue to increase, with corresponding increases in our cost of revenues to reflect increased compensation levels for such professionals. We also expect that we will continue to incur additional costs to monitor and improve operational efficiency of our hybrid working model, invest in information technology solutions, including adaption to evolving modes of seeking such solutions through cloud-based hosting arrangements and security measures to safeguard against information security risks. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” under “Risks Related to Our Business––Employee wage increases may prevent us from sustaining our competitive advantage and may reduce our profit margin.” However, a significant portion of our client contracts include inflation-based adjustments to our billing rates year over year which partially offset such increase in cost of revenues.
We generally experience a higher cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues during the initial 12 to 18 months in a long-term digital operations and solutions contract due to upfront investments in infrastructure, resource hiring and training during migration. The cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues improves as we scale up, achieve operational efficiencies and complete the migration.
Operating Expenses
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses ("SG&A")
Our General and Administrative expenses (“G&A”) comprise of expenses relating to salaries and benefits (including stock-based compensation), retirement benefits as well as costs related to recruitment, training and retention of senior management and other support personnel in enabling functions, telecommunications, utilities, travel and other miscellaneous administrative costs. G&A expenses also include acquisition-related costs, legal and professional fees (which represent the costs of third party legal, tax, accounting, immigration and other advisors), litigation claims, cost of technology solutions sought through evolving modes of cloud-based hosting arrangements, investment in product development, AI and other digital technologies, bad debt allowance and stock-based compensation expenses related to grant of our equity awards to members of our board of directors. We expect our G&A costs to increase as we continue to strengthen our support and enabling functions and invest in leadership development, performance management and training programs.
Selling and marketing expenses primarily consist of salaries and benefits (including stock-based compensation), retirement benefits and other compensation expenses of sales and marketing and client management personnel, sales commission, travel and brand building, client events and conferences. We expect that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase as we invest in our sales and client management functions to better serve our clients and in our branding.
Depreciation and Amortization Expense
Depreciation and amortization expense pertains to depreciation of our property and equipment, including network equipment, cabling, computers, office furniture and equipment, motor vehicles and leasehold improvements and amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations. As part of our ongoing evaluation of our business needs, we continually optimize our operations centers and expect depreciation to decrease on assets related to operations centers, such as office furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements. As our business continues to expand, we expect additional investments in digital technologies and equipment, including laptops, desktop computers, servers and other infrastructure, and increased reliance on hybrid working model, we expect increases in depreciation on assets-related to such investments. Property and equipment, if evaluated as being used differently than as originally intended are assessed for revision of their useful life, thereby revising their future depreciation to reflect the actual use of such property and equipment over the remaining shortened life. We expect amortization of intangible assets to increase further as we pursue strategic relationships and acquisitions.
Foreign Exchange Gain, Net
We report our financial results in U.S. dollars.
Our revenues are primarily denominated in the U.S. dollar, however, a portion of our revenues are earned in the U.K. pound sterling representing 10.7% and 10.1% of our total revenues in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. We also incur a significant portion of our expenses in the Indian rupee, the Philippine peso, the South African rand and the U.K. pound sterling, representing 29.7%, 8.2%, 3.5% and 2.8%, respectively, of our total expenses in fiscal 2024, compared to 28.5%, 8.2%, 2.0% and 3.1%, respectively, of our total expenses in fiscal 2023. The exchange rates among these currencies and the U.S. dollar have changed over the years and may fluctuate substantially in the future as well. The results of our operations could be substantially impacted as these currencies appreciate or depreciate against the U.S. dollar. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” under “Risks Related to the International Nature of Our Business––Currency exchange rate fluctuations in the various 
34
Table of Contents
currencies in which we do business, or the failure of our hedging strategies to mitigate such fluctuations, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations,” as well as Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 17 - Derivatives and Hedge Accounting to our consolidated financial statements under Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk-Components of Market Risk-Foreign Currency Risk.”
Interest Expense
Interest expense primarily consist of interest on our borrowings under our revolving credit facility, term loan facility and convertible senior notes, finance leases and notional interest implicit in the purchase of property and equipment.
Other Income/(Expense), Net
Other income/(expense), net primarily consists of gain/(loss) on sale and mark-to-market, dividend income and interest income on our short-term and long-term investments, cash equivalents, as applicable. Other income/(expense), net also consists of changes in fair value of contingent consideration related to business combinations, interest on refunds received from income tax authorities in India on completion of tax assessments, profit or loss on disposal of long-lived assets and components of net periodic benefit cost such as interest cost, expected return on plan assets and amortization of actuarial gain or loss.
Income Taxes
We are subject to taxes in the countries we operate in. Our future tax liabilities could be adversely affected by any new unfavorable tax legislative and other changes in such countries. We continuously monitor such changes to assess and quantify the potential impacts on our consolidated financial statements.
We periodically evaluate opportunities to distribute cash among our group entities to fund our operations in the United States and other countries, and as and when we decide to distribute, we may have to accrue additional taxes in accordance with local tax laws, rules and regulations in the relevant foreign jurisdictions. 
We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss carry forwards. We determine if a valuation allowance is required on the basis of an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized.
We currently benefit from corporate tax holidays in our qualified Philippines Economic Zone Authority operations centers in the Philippines. Our ability to utilize these tax holidays could be adversely affected by any new unfavorable tax legislative changes. We continuously monitor such changes to assess and quantify any potential impacts on our consolidated financial statements.
In October 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) introduced Pillar Two Framework imposing a global minimum tax rate of 15%. We have determined that the impact of the Pillar Two Framework did not have material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). A summary of our significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements under Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
We consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements, as their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment regarding matters that are inherently uncertain at the time an estimate is made. 
These policies include revenue recognition, allowance for expected credit losses, business combinations and goodwill, stock-based compensation, income taxes, employee benefits, and contingencies.
These accounting policies, estimates and the associated risks are set out below. Future events may not develop exactly as forecasted and estimates routinely require adjustment.

Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized when services are provided to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration which we expect to be entitled to in exchange for the services provided. We recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation by providing services to a customer.
Revenue is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer and excludes value added tax, business tax, any applicable discounts and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. Reimbursements of out-of-pocket expenses are included as a part of revenue.
Significant judgments
Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations
We sometimes enter into contracts with our customers which include promises to transfer multiple products and services to the customer. Determining whether products and services are considered as distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately rather than as one performance obligation may require significant judgment. The transaction price is allocated to performance obligations on relative standalone selling price basis.
Judgment is also required to determine the standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation. In instances where the standalone selling price is not directly observable, it is determined using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs.
The contracts with our customers may be modified to add, remove or change existing performance obligations, which requires judgment to evaluate and determine whether such performance obligations are to be accounted for on a prospective basis as a separate contract or as a termination of an existing contract and creation of a new contract.
Variable Consideration
Variability in the transaction price arises primarily due to service level agreements, volume discounts entailing variability in revenue earned, and contracts under our payment integrity services whereby variability in revenue is attributable to the amount we enable our customers to recover.
We consider our historical experience, including trends with similar transactions and expectations regarding the contract in estimating the amount of variable consideration that should be recognized during a period.
We believe that the expected value method is most appropriate for determining the variable consideration since we have a large number of contracts with similar nature of transactions/services.
Type of Contracts Requiring Judgment
Revenues from payment integrity services having contingent fee arrangements are recognized by us at the point in time when a performance obligation is satisfied, which is when we identify an overpayment claim. In such contracts, our consideration is contingent upon the actual collections made by our customers and net of any subsequent retraction claims. Based on guidance on “variable consideration” in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 (“ASC Topic 606”), we use our historical experience and projections to determine the expected recoveries from our customers and recognize revenue based upon such expected recoveries. Any adjustment required due to change in estimates are recorded in the period in which such change is identified. The estimated amount of revenue to be collected from our customers are presented as contract assets within “Other Current Assets”.
Allowance for Expected Credit Losses
We record accounts receivable net of allowances for expected credit losses. Allowances for credit losses are established through the evaluation of aging of accounts receivables, prior collection experience, current market conditions, forecasts about future economic conditions, customers’ financial condition and the amount of accounts receivable in dispute to estimate the collectability of these accounts receivable. Accounts receivable balances are written-off against the allowance for expected credit losses after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote.
Business Combinations and Goodwill
We account for all business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting as prescribed by ASC Topic 805, 
Business Combinations
. The guidance requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including intangible assets and contingent consideration, and allocation of 
36
Table of Contents
purchase price over such assets and liabilities on the acquisition date. The significant estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, the timing and amount of future revenue and cash flows based on, among other things, discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows, customer attrition rates and the long-term growth rate applied within the discounted cash flow model. This requires a high degree of our judgment and the need to involve fair value specialists to evaluate the reasonableness of our valuation methodology and the selection of inputs to the valuation.
In addition, assets acquired and liabilities assumed including uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances in connection with business combinations are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We subsequently re-evaluate the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including additional assets and liabilities identified subsequent to acquisition date, with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill within the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date).
We also perform a quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment, if based on the qualitative factors, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The significant estimates and assumptions include, the timing and amount of future revenue and cash flows, discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows and the long-term growth rate applied within the discounted cash flow model. If based on the quantitative impairment analysis, the carrying value of the goodwill of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of such goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
Stock-Based Compensation
Under the fair value recognition provisions of ASC Topic 718, 
Compensation-Stock Compensation
, cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period.
Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires significant judgment, including estimating the expected term over which the stock awards will be outstanding before they are exercised and the expected volatility of our stock.
We grant performance-based restricted stock units (“PRSUs”) to executive officers and other specified employees. Generally, we grant PRSUs cliff vest based on an aggregated revenue target (“PUs”) for a three-year period, while grants based on market conditions (“MUs”) are contingent on meeting or exceeding the total shareholder return relative to a group of peer companies specified under our 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2018 Plan”), and are measured over a three-year performance period.
The fair value of each PU is determined based on the market price of one share of our common stock on the day prior to the date of grant. The grant date fair value for the MUs is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The Monte Carlo simulation model simulates a range of possible future stock prices and estimates the probabilities of the potential payouts. The Monte Carlo simulation model also involves the use of additional key assumptions, including dividend yield and risk-free interest rate. We periodically assess the reasonableness of our assumptions and update our estimates as required. If actual results differ significantly from our estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected.
Stock-based compensation expense associated with our 2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan is measured at fair-value using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model at commencement of each offering period and recognized over that offering period.
Income Taxes
We account for income tax using the asset and liability method. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized in respect of future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases and operating losses carried forward, if any. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the anticipated tax rates for the years in which such temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We recognize the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities during the period in which the new tax rate was enacted or the change in tax status was filed or approved. Deferred tax assets are recognized in full, subject to a valuation allowance that reduces the amount recognized to that which is more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the likelihood of realization, we consider all available evidence for each jurisdiction including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. With respect to any entity that benefits from a corporate tax holiday, deferred tax assets or liabilities for existing temporary differences are recorded only to the extent such temporary differences are expected to reverse following the expiration of the tax holiday.

Table of Contents
We also evaluate potential exposures related to tax contingencies or claims made by the tax authorities in various jurisdictions in order to determine whether a reserve may be required. A reserve is recorded if we believe that a loss is more likely than not, and if the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. Such reserves are based on estimates and, consequently, are subject to changing facts and circumstances, including the progress of ongoing audits, changes in case law and the passage of new legislation. We have established adequate reserves to cover any potential tax contingencies or claims.
ASC Topic 740, 
Income Taxes
, requires companies to recognize, measure, present and disclose uncertain tax positions. We employ a two-step process for recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining, based on the technical merits, that the position will, more likely than not, be sustained upon examination. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount of the tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. We have established adequate reserves to cover all uncertain tax positions.
Employee Benefits
We record contributions to defined contribution plans in our consolidated statements of income in the period in which services are rendered by the covered employees. Current service costs for defined benefit plans are recognized in the period to which they relate. The liability in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated annually by using the projected unit credit method and various actuarial assumptions including discount rates, mortality, expected return on assets, expected increase in the compensation rates and attrition rates. We evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually. If actual results differ significantly from our estimates, current service costs for defined benefit plans and our results of operations could be materially impacted.
Contingencies 
Loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a material loss contingency is reasonably possible but not probable, we do not record a liability, but instead disclose the nature and the amount of the claim, and an estimate of the loss or range of loss, if such an estimate can be made. Significant judgment is required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective and based on the information available from the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. As additional information becomes available, we reassess any potential liability related to any pending litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in estimates of any potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

Revenues for fiscal 2024 were up by $207.7 million, or 12.7%, compared to fiscal 2023, driven primarily by revenue growth from our new and existing clients in all of our reportable segments.
Revenue growth in Insurance of $84.1 million from fiscal 2023, was primarily driven by expansion of business from our new and existing clients during fiscal 2024.
Revenue growth in Healthcare of $10.4 million from fiscal 2023, was primarily driven by expansion of business from our existing clients during fiscal 2024.
Revenue growth in Emerging Business of $46.0 million from fiscal 2023 was primarily driven by expansion of business from our new and existing clients of $45.4 million and an increase in revenues of $0.6 million that was mainly attributable to the appreciation of the U.K. pound sterling against the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2024.
Revenue growth in Analytics of $67.2 million from fiscal 2023 was primarily driven by higher volumes in our annuity and project-based engagements from our new and existing clients of $66.5 million, including incremental revenue from our August 2024 acquisition of ITI Data and an increase in revenues of $0.7 million that was mainly attributable to the appreciation of the U.K. pound sterling against the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2024.

Cost of revenues for fiscal 2024 increased by $124.5 million, or 12.2% compared to fiscal 2023. The increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to increases in employee-related costs including restructuring costs and technology costs, partially offset by foreign exchange gain, net of hedging. See Note 26 – Restructuring Costs to our consolidated financial statements under Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Our gross margin for fiscal 2024 was 37.6% compared to 37.3% for fiscal 2023, an increase of 30 basis points ("bps").
The increase in cost of revenues in Insurance of $48.6 million from fiscal 2023 was primarily due to increases in employee-related costs of $42.3 million on account of higher headcount, restructuring costs and wage inflation, higher technology costs of $4.8 million on account of increased subscription to cloud-based software licenses and our continued investments in our hybrid working model, higher facilities costs of $3.9 million and higher other operating costs of

$3.1 million, partially offset by foreign exchange gain, net of hedging of $5.5 million. Gross margin in Insurance increased by 90 bps from fiscal 2023, primarily due to operational efficiencies during fiscal 2024.
The increase in cost of revenues in Healthcare of $8.6 million from fiscal 2023 was primarily due to increases in employee-related costs of $9.0 million on account of higher headcount and wage inflation, and higher technology costs of $1.3 million on account of increased subscription to cloud-based software licenses and use of the hybrid working model, partially offset by foreign exchange gain, net of hedging of $1.7 million. Gross margin in Healthcare decreased by 160 bps from fiscal 2023, primarily due to ramp-ups for certain existing clients during fiscal 2024.
The increase in cost of revenues in Emerging Business of $30.5 million from fiscal 2023 was primarily due to increases in employee-related costs of $28.6 million on account of higher headcount, restructuring costs and wage inflation, higher technology costs of $3.0 million on account of increased subscription to cloud-based software licenses and use of the hybrid working model and higher other operating costs $2.0 million, partially offset by foreign exchange gain, net of hedging of $3.1 million. Gross margin in Emerging Business decreased by 140 bps from fiscal 2023, primarily due to ramp-ups for certain existing clients during fiscal 2024.
The increase in cost of revenues in Analytics of $36.8 million from fiscal 2023 was primarily due to increases in employee-related costs of $34.8 million on account of higher headcount, restructuring costs and wage inflation, including incremental cost related to our August 2024 acquisition of ITI Data and higher technology costs of $8.6 million on account of increased subscription to cloud-based software licenses and use of the hybrid working model, partially offset by lower other operating costs $4.2 million and foreign exchange gain, net of hedging of $2.4 million. Gross margin in Analytics increased by 70 bps from fiscal 2023, primarily due to higher revenues and operational efficiencies, partially offset by impact of restructuring costs of 40 bps during fiscal 2024.

Foreign Exchange Gain, net.
 Foreign exchange gains and losses are primarily attributable to the movement of the U.S. dollar against the Indian rupee, the Philippine peso, the U.K. pound sterling and the South African rand during fiscal 2024, compared to fiscal 2023. The average exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the Indian rupee increased from 82.60 during fiscal 2023 to 83.76 during fiscal 2024. The average exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the Philippine peso increased from 55.56 during fiscal 2023 to 57.39 during fiscal 2024. The average exchange rate of the U.K. pound sterling against the U.S. dollar increased from 1.25 during fiscal 2023 to 1.28 during fiscal 2024. The average exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the South African rand decreased from 18.51 during fiscal 2023 to 18.35 during fiscal 2024.
We recorded a foreign exchange gain, net of $1.5 million for fiscal 2023 compared to a foreign exchange gain, net of $0.9 million for fiscal 2024.
Interest expense
. Interest expense increased from $13.2 million for fiscal 2023 to $19.3 million for fiscal 2024, primarily due to higher average borrowings during fiscal 2024, compared to fiscal 2023.

Other income, net increased by $5.3 million, from $10.8 million for fiscal 2023 to $16.1 million for fiscal 2024. The increase is primarily due to higher yield on our investments of $2.6 million and net impact of $2.5 million from changes in fair value of contingent consideration related to our June 2022 acquisition of Inbound Media Group, LLC and December 2021 acquisition of Clairvoyant during fiscal 2024, compared to fiscal 2023.
Income Tax Expense
. The effective tax rate increased from 22.5% for fiscal 2023 to 24.1% for fiscal 2024. We recorded income tax expense of $62.9 million and $53.5 million for fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in income tax expense was primarily as a result of higher profit, increase in non-deductible expenses and lower excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, partially offset by decrease in foreign tax rate differential during fiscal 2024, compared to fiscal 2023.
Net Income
. Net income increased from $184.6 million for fiscal 2023 to $198.3 million for fiscal 2024, primarily due to increase in income from operations of $24.8 million and higher other income, net of $5.3 million, partially offset by higher interest expense of $6.1 million, lower foreign exchange gain, net of $0.6 million and higher income tax expense of $9.4 million.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $340.6 million and $290.8 million, respectively, in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which $296.0 million and $237.7 million, respectively, is located in foreign jurisdictions that upon distribution may be subject to withholding and other taxes. We periodically evaluate opportunities to distribute cash among our group entities to fund our operations, expand our business and make strategic acquisitions in the United States and other geographies, and as and when we decide to distribute, we may have to accrue additional taxes in accordance with local tax laws, rules and regulations in the relevant foreign jurisdictions. During 2024, some of our foreign subsidiaries repatriated $38.2 million (net of $2.6 million withholding taxes) to the United States. 
Operating Activities:
Net cash provided by operating activities was $268.5 million for fiscal 2024, compared to $211.2 million for fiscal 2023, reflecting higher cash earnings, partially offset by higher working capital needs. The major drivers contributing to the increase of $57.3 million year-over-year included the following:
•
Increase in cash earnings, including adjustments for non-cash and other items contributed higher cash flow of $18.0 million for fiscal 2024, compared to fiscal 2023. These adjustments include fair value changes in investments, unrealized foreign currency exchange gain, deferred tax effects, stock-based employee compensation, fair value changes in contingent consideration, depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets and intangibles acquired in business combinations, among others.
•
Changes in accounts receivable, including advance billings, contributed higher cash flow of $61.8 million for fiscal 2024, compared to fiscal 2023. Collections in accounts receivable, including advance billings was driven by revenue growth for fiscal 2024. Our days sales outstanding were 62 days as of December 31, 2024, compared to 64 days as of December 31, 2023.
•
Payment of contingent consideration related to our December 2021 acquisition of Clairvoyant contributed to a higher cash payout of $11.0 million for fiscal 2024, compared to fiscal 2023.
•
Changes in other assets, accounts payables including other liabilities contributed higher cash payout of $11.5 million for fiscal 2024, compared to fiscal 2023.
Investing Activities:
 Cash used for investing activities were $119.1 million for fiscal 2024, compared to $12.0 million for fiscal 2023. The increase in cash used for investing activities of $107.1 million year-over-year is primarily due to higher net purchase of investments of $88.8 million and net cash used for business acquisition of $24.3 million for fiscal 2024, compared to fiscal 2023. This was partially offset by lower capital expenditures in infrastructure, technology assets, software and product developments of $6.5 million for fiscal 2024, compared to fiscal 2023.
Financing Activities:
 Cash used for financing activities were $119.1 million for fiscal 2024, compared to $181.4 million for fiscal 2023. The decrease in cash used for financing activities of $62.3 million year-over-year was primarily due to net proceeds from borrowings under our revolving credit facility and new term loan facility of $88.8 million for fiscal 2024, compared to net repayment of our borrowings of $50.0 million for fiscal 2023. The increase was also due to higher purchases of treasury stock of $76.1 million under our share repurchase program for fiscal 2024, compared to fiscal 2023.
We expect to use cash from operating activities to maintain and expand our business by making investments, primarily related to building new digital capabilities, including AI, infrastructure and purchase telecommunications equipment and computer hardware and software in connection with managing client operations.

Table of Contents
We incurred $46.3 million of capital expenditures during fiscal 2024. We expect to incur total capital expenditures of between $50 million to $55 million in fiscal 2025, primarily to meet our growth requirements, including additions to our facilities and infrastructure, as well as investments in technology applications, product development and other, digital technologies.
In connection with any tax assessment orders that have been issued, or may be issued against us or our subsidiaries, we may be required to deposit additional amounts with the relevant authorities with respect to such assessment orders. See Note 25 - Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further details.
We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and sources of liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy our short-term cash requirements. Our future cash requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, our investments in strategic initiatives like acquisition of complementary businesses, capital expenditures and  continued stock repurchases under our board-authorized stock repurchase program, which may require the use of significant cash resources and/or additional financing. We anticipate that we will continue to rely upon cash from operating activities to finance most of our above-mentioned requirements, although if we have significant growth through acquisitions, we may need to obtain additional financing.
In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contracts and commitments that obligate us to make payments in the future. These obligations include borrowings, including interest obligations, purchase commitments, operating and finance lease commitments, employee benefit payments under gratuity plans, payments for contingent consideration and uncertain tax positions. See Note 16 - Fair Value Measurements - Fair Value of Contingent Consideration, Note 18 - Borrowings, Note 20 - Employee Benefit Plans, Note 21 - Leases, Note 22 - Income Taxes and Note 25 - Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further information on material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations.
In the ordinary course of business, we provide standby letters of credit to third parties primarily for facility leases. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had outstanding letters of credit of $0.8 million and $0.5 million, respectively, that were not recognized in our consolidated balance sheets. These are unlikely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. We had no other off-balance sheet arrangements or obligations.

Credit Agreement
We held a $300.0 million revolving credit facility pursuant to our credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), dated as of November 21, 2017, with certain lenders and Citibank N.A. as Administrative Agent, which was amended and restated on April 18, 2022 (the “2022 Credit Agreement”). Among other things, the 2022 Credit Agreement (a) provides for the issuance of new revolving credit commitments such that the aggregate amount of revolving credit commitments available as of April 18, 2022 is equal to $400.0 million; and (b) extends the maturity date of the revolving credit facility from November 21, 2022 to April 18, 2027.

Table of Contents
On August 9, 2024, we and each of our wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries entered into a First Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with Citibank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, and certain lenders (the “2024 Credit Agreement”), pursuant to which the parties thereto amended and restated the 2022 Credit Agreement. Among other things, the 2024 Credit Agreement (a) provides for a $100.0 million increase to the revolving credit commitments such that the aggregate amount of revolving credit commitments available as of August 9, 2024 is equal to $500.0 million; and (b) provides for the issuance of a new term loan facility in the aggregate amount of $100.0 million with an annual prepayment amount of 5%. The increased revolving credit facility and the new term loan facility both mature on April 18, 2027.
The 2024 Credit Agreement includes a letter of credit sub facility and is voluntarily pre-payable from time to time without premium or penalty. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility can be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions. Borrowings of $100.0 million under the term loan facility (which was drawn based on adjusted SOFR) were used to repay the borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility on August 9, 2024.
Obligations under the 2024 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by our wholly-owned material domestic subsidiaries and are secured by all or substantially all of our and our material domestic subsidiaries’ assets. The 2024 Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, but not limited to, restrictions on the ability to incur indebtedness, create liens, make certain investments, make certain dividends and distributions, enter into, or undertake, certain liquidations, mergers, consolidations or acquisitions and dispose of certain assets or subsidiaries. In addition, the 2024 Credit Agreement contains a covenant to not permit the interest coverage ratio or the total net leverage ratio for the four consecutive quarter period ending on the last day of each fiscal quarter, to be less than 3.0 to 1.0 or more than 3.5 to 1.0, respectively.
The 2024 Credit Agreement bears interest at a rate equal to specified prime rate (alternate base rate) or adjusted SOFR, plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin on the revolving credit facility is tied to our total net leverage ratio and ranges from 0% to 0.75% per annum on loans pegged to the specified prime rate, and 0.875% to 1.75% per annum on loans pegged to the adjusted SOFR. The applicable margin on the term loan facility is also tied to our total net leverage ratio and ranges from 0.125% to 1.00% per annum on loans pegged to the specified prime rate, and 1.125% to 2.00% per annum on loans pegged to the adjusted SOFR. The revolving credit commitments under the 2024 Credit Agreement are subject to a commitment fee which is also tied to our total net leverage ratio, and ranges from 0.125% to 0.275% per annum on the average daily amount by which the aggregate revolving commitments exceed the sum of outstanding revolving loans and letter of credit obligations.
The effective interest rates of the revolving credit facility and the term loan facility are as follows:

ITEM 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
General
Market risk is the volatility of future earnings and cash flows that may result from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments. Market risk is attributable to all market sensitive financial instruments including foreign currency receivables and payables.
Our exposure to market risk is a function of our expenses and revenue generating activities in foreign currencies. The objective of market risk management is to avoid excessive exposure to our earnings and equity of such market driven losses. We manage market risk through our treasury operations using financial instruments. Our senior management and our board of directors approve our treasury operations’ objectives and policies. The responsibilities of our treasury operations include management of cash resources, including borrowing strategies, implementing hedging strategies for foreign currency exposures, and ensuring compliance with market risk limits and policies.
Components of Market Risk
Foreign Currency Risk.
 We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our revenues are primarily denominated in the U.S. dollar representing 85.1% of our total revenues and the U.K. pound sterling representing 10.7% of our total revenues for fiscal 2024. A significant portion of our expenses are incurred in the Indian rupee, the Philippine peso, the South African rand and the U.K. pound sterling, representing 29.7%, 8.2%, 3.5% and 2.8%, respectively, of our total expenses for fiscal 2024. We also incur expenses in the U.S. dollar and currencies of other countries where we have operations. The exchange rates among the Indian rupee, the Philippine peso, the U.K. pound sterling and the U.S. dollar have fluctuated within the fiscal 2024, over the recent years and may fluctuate in the future.
Our foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily arises from our foreign currency revenues, expenses incurred by our subsidiaries, including foreign subsidiaries in foreign currencies and foreign currency accounts receivable and payable. The average exchange rate of the U.S dollar against the Indian rupee increased from 82.60 for fiscal 2023 to 83.76 for fiscal 2024, representing a depreciation of 1.4% against the U.S dollar. The average exchange rate of the U.S dollar against the Philippine peso increased from 55.56 for fiscal 2023 to 57.39 for fiscal 2024, representing a depreciation of 3.3% against the U.S dollar. The average exchange rate of the U.K. pound sterling against the U.S. dollar increased from 1.25 for fiscal 2023 to 1.28 for fiscal 2024, representing an appreciation of 2.6% against the U.S dollar. Based upon our level of operations for fiscal 2024 and excluding any hedging arrangements that we had in place during that period, a 10% appreciation/depreciation in the Indian rupee, the Philippine peso and the U.K. pound sterling against the U.S. dollar would have increased/decreased our revenues by approximately $7.1 million, $0.5 million and $10.8 million, respectively and increased/decreased our expenses incurred by approximately $46.8 million, $12.9 million and $4.5 million, respectively for fiscal 2024.
In order to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuation risks and minimize the earnings and cash flow volatility associated with forecasted transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges. These contracts must be settled on the day of maturity or may be canceled subject to the receipts or payments of any gains or losses respectively, equal to the difference between the contract exchange rate and the market exchange rate on the date of cancellation. We do not enter into foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes. As such, we may not purchase adequate contracts to insulate ourselves from the foreign exchange currency risks. In addition, any such contracts may not perform effectively as a hedging mechanism. We may, in the future, make changes to our hedging policies, and have done so in the past. The principal foreign currencies that are hedged are the Indian rupee, the Philippine peso and the South African rand.
The impact related to these foreign currency forward contracts on earnings and/or cash flows is immaterial as the impact of the maturing cash flow hedges in respective periods are intended to primarily offset the foreign currency impact on the related expenses. Further, some of our client contracts include protection against foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which minimizes the impact of volatility in the exchange rates on our operating results.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had outstanding cash flow hedges with notional amounts of $984.3 million and $722.8 million, respectively, with the maximum outstanding term of approximately 45 months and 42 months, respectively. The mark-to-market gain/(loss), net upon fair valuation of outstanding cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $(9.2) million and $5.4 million, respectively, and is included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss)” on our consolidated balance sheets. For fiscal 2024 and 2023, we recognized $0.6 million and $5.7 million, respectively, as foreign exchange loss from maturing cash flow hedges, which was largely offset by the foreign exchange translation gain on the related expenses.
46
Table of Contents
We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts from time to time to hedge our intercompany balances and other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currencies
,
 against the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates associated with remeasurement of such assets and liabilities to functional currency. These foreign currency forward contracts do not qualify as fair value hedges under ASC Topic 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging
. Changes in the fair value of these financial instruments are recognized in our consolidated statements of income and are included in “Foreign exchange gain, net.” These financial instruments mitigate balance sheet risk due to foreign currency exchange rate movements as gains and losses on the settlement of these financial instruments are intended to offset the revaluation gains and losses on the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities being hedged. Foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of the U.S. dollar (USD) 178.9 million, the U.K. pound sterling (GBP) 21.0 million, the Euro (EUR) 9.0 million, South African rand (ZAR) 10.0 million and the Australian dollar (AUD) 4.8 million were outstanding as of December 31, 2024 compared to USD 170.5 million, GBP 14.5 million, EUR 5.2 million, ZAR 150.2 million and AUD 3.5 million outstanding as of December 31, 2023.

The fair values of these financial instruments as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were insignificant and are included in the “Foreign exchange gain, net” in our consolidated statements of income. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the outstanding derivative instruments had maturities of a maximum of 31 days, each.
Interest Rate Risk.
 We are also exposed to interest rate risk arising from our indebtedness. In order to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and minimize the earnings and cash flow volatility associated with floating rate indebtedness, we enter into interest rate swaps to hedge cash flow risks on our revolving credit facility having floating interest rate obligations. The swap transaction involves the exchange of fixed for floating interest payments. However, in circumstances where we believe additional fixed-rate debt would be beneficial, we may choose to terminate a previously executed swap, or swap certain floating interest payments to fixed.
As described in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” we held a $300.0 million revolving credit facility and a letter of credit sub-facility pursuant to our Credit Agreement dated as of November 21, 2017, which was amended and restated on April 18, 2022 (the “2022 Credit Agreement”). On April 18, 2022, we entered into the 2022 Credit Agreement, that provides for a $400.0 million revolving credit facility and a letter of credit sub-facility. On August 9, 2024, we entered into the 2024 Credit Agreement, that provides for a $100.0 million increase to the revolving credit commitments such that the aggregate amount of revolving credit commitments available is now equal to $500.0 million and provides for the issuance of a new term loan facility in the aggregate amount of $100.0 million with an annual amortization of 5%. The increased credit facility and the new term loan facility both mature on April 18, 2027.
The 2024 Credit Agreement bears interest at a rate equal to specified prime rate (alternate base rate) or adjusted SOFR, plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin on the revolving credit facility is tied to our total net leverage ratio and ranges from 0% to 0.75% per annum on loans pegged to the specified prime rate, and 0.875% to 1.75% per annum on loans pegged to the adjusted SOFR. The applicable margin on the term loan facility is also tied to our total net leverage ratio and ranges from 0.125% to 1.00% per annum on loans pegged to the specified prime rate, and 1.125% to 2.00% per annum on loans pegged to the adjusted SOFR. The revolving credit commitments under the 2024 Credit Agreement are subject to a commitment fee which is also tied to our total net leverage ratio, and ranges from 0.125% to 0.275% per annum on the average daily amount by which the aggregate revolving commitments exceed the sum of outstanding revolving loans and letter of credit obligations. A 50 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have impacted our interest expense for fiscal 2024 by approximately $1.8 million.
We manage a portion of our interest rate risk related to our revolving credit facility having variable interest rate obligations by entering into interest rate swaps under which we receive floating rate payments based on SOFR and make payments based on a fixed rate. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had outstanding interest rate swaps having a notional amount of $nil and $75.0 million, respectively.
We had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $340.6 million and $290.8 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These amounts were invested principally in a short-term investment portfolio primarily comprised of highly-rated debt mutual funds, money market funds and time deposits. We do not make such investments for trading or speculative purposes. The cash and cash equivalents are held for potential acquisitions of complementary businesses or assets, capital expenditures, working capital requirements and general corporate purposes. We believe that we have no material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates. The interest income from these funds is subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates. Declines in interest rates would reduce our future investment income. A 50 basis point increase or decrease in short term rates would have impacted our interest and dividend income for fiscal 2024 by approximately $0.9 million.
Credit Risk.
 As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we have accounts receivable, net $304.3 million and $308.1 million, respectively. We believe that our credit policies reflect normal industry terms and business risk. We do not anticipate non-performance by the counterparties and, accordingly, do not require collateral. Credit losses and write-offs of accounts receivable balances historically have not been material. No single client owed more than 10% of our accounts receivable, net as on December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Those rules define internal control over financial reporting as a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
•
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets;
•
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP;
•
provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization of our management and our board of directors; and
•
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of ExlService Holdings, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ExlService Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 25, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Revenues - Refer to Notes 2 and 4 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
Revenues from payment integrity services having contingent fee arrangements are recognized by the Company at the point in time when a performance obligation is satisfied, which is when it identifies an overpayment claim. In such contracts, the Company’s consideration is contingent upon the actual collections made by its customers and net of any subsequent retraction claims. Based on guidance on variable consideration in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC Topic 606”), the Company uses its historical experience and projections to determine the expected amount of revenue to be recognized based on the expected consideration to be received from its customers. Any adjustment required due to change in estimates are recorded in the period in which such change is identified.  
We identified revenue recognized under contracts for the Company’s payment integrity services as a critical audit matter because of the judgments necessary for management to determine the transaction price, represented by the amount of expected recoveries from its customers. This required extensive audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment when performing

audit procedures to audit management’s estimates of transaction price used to recognize revenue and evaluating the results of those procedures.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to testing the transaction price of the Company’s contracts to provide payment integrity services included the following, among others:
•
We tested the effectiveness of the internal controls related to the assumptions used to determine the transaction price that is probable of recovery, including subsequent changes to amounts earned.
•
We selected a sample of transactions and performed the following procedures for evaluating management’s estimate and underlying data used for deriving transaction price:
•
Read the underlying contract with the customer and agreed the commission rate for the selected transaction to the Company’s computation used to determine the amount of revenue recognized.
•
Tested management’s estimate used to determine the transaction price that is probable of recovery, including subsequent changes to amounts earned.
•
Tested the accuracy and completeness of the underlying data (i.e. historical experience) used by management to support such estimate.
•
Tested the mathematical accuracy of the Company’s estimate analysis.
•
We evaluated management’s ability to estimate the transaction price accurately by comparing actual recoveries to management’s historical estimates.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of ExlService Holdings, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of ExlService Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 25, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2024 
(In thousands, except per share amount and share count)
1. 
Organization
ExlService Holdings, Inc. (“ExlService Holdings”) is organized as a corporation under the laws of the State of Delaware. ExlService Holdings, together with its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, the “Company”), is a global data and artificial intelligence (“AI”) company that offers services and solutions to reinvent client business models, drive better outcomes and unlock growth with speed. The Company harnesses the power of data, AI, and deep industry knowledge to transform businesses, including the world’s leading corporations in industries including insurance, healthcare, banking and capital markets, retail, communications and media, and energy and infrastructure, among others.
The Company’s clients are located principally in the United States of America (“U.S.”) and the United Kingdom (“U.K.”).
2. 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
(a)
Basis of Preparation and Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”).

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a consolidated basis and reflect the financial statements of ExlService Holdings, Inc. and all of its subsidiaries and includes the Company's share in the results of its associates.
The standalone financial statements of subsidiaries are fully consolidated on a line-by-line basis. Intra-group balances and transactions, and gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated while preparing consolidated financial statements.
The Company’s investments in equity affiliates are initially recorded at cost and any excess purchase consideration paid over proportionate share of the fair value of the net assets of the investee at the acquisition date is recognized as goodwill. The proportionate share of net income or loss of the investee after its acquisition is recognized in the consolidated statements of income.
Accounting policies of the respective individual subsidiaries and equity affiliates are aligned wherever necessary, so as to ensure consistency with the accounting policies that are adopted by the Company under U.S. GAAP.
(b)
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities included in the consolidated financial statements. Although these estimates are based on management’s best assessment of the current business environment, actual results may be different from those estimates. The significant estimates that affect the consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, estimates of the fair value of the identifiable intangible assets and contingent consideration, purchase price allocation, including revenue projections and the discount rate applied within the discounted cash flow model for business acquisitions, credit risk of customers, the nature and timing of the satisfaction of performance obligations, the standalone selling price of performance obligations, variable consideration in a customer contract, expected recoverability from customers with contingent fee arrangements, estimated costs to complete fixed price contracts, assets and obligations related to employee benefit plans, deferred tax valuation allowances, income-tax uncertainties and other contingencies, valuation of derivative financial instruments and stock-based awards, and useful life of long-lived assets and other intangible assets. The significant assumptions underneath these estimates include, but are not limited to assumptions to calculate stock-based compensation expense, determine incremental borrowing rate to calculate lease liabilities and right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, determine lease term to calculate single operating lease cost, determine pattern of

generation of economic benefits to calculate depreciation and amortization for long-lived assets and other intangible assets, and recoverability of long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets.
(c)
Foreign Currency Translation
The functional currency of each entity in the Company is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates. Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded into functional currency at the rates of exchange prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured into functional currency at the rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the functional currency at exchange rates that prevailed on the date of inception of the transaction. All foreign exchange gains and losses arising on re-measurement are recorded in the Company's consolidated statements of income.
The assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries for which the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars, the reporting currency, at the rate of exchange prevailing on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates prevailing on the last business day of each month, which approximates the average monthly exchange rate. Share capital and other equity items are translated at exchange rates that prevailed on the date of inception of the transaction. Resulting translation adjustments are included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss)” in the consolidated balance sheets.

(d)
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized when services are provided to the Company's customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expect to be entitled to in exchange for the services provided. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by providing services to a customer.
Revenue is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer and excludes value added tax, business tax, any applicable discounts and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. Reimbursements of out-of-pocket expenses are included as a part of revenue.
Nature of Services
The Company derives its revenues from digital operations and solutions and analytics services. The Company provides digital operations and solutions and analytics services helping businesses enhance revenue growth and improve profitability. 
Type of Contracts and Basis of Recognition
i.
Revenues under time-and-material and transaction based contracts are recognized as the services are performed. When the terms of the client contract specify service level parameters that must be met (such as turnaround time or accuracy), the Company monitors such service level parameters to determine if any service credits or penalties have been incurred. Revenues are recognized net of any penalties or service credits that are due to a client.
ii.
Revenues for the Company’s fixed-price contracts, which include business support services provided on a fixed price basis or implementation of applications or solutions, are recognized considering costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying the Company’s performance obligations. Incurred cost represents work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby reasonably reflects transfer of control to the client. The use of this method requires significant judgment to estimate the stage of completion and/or cost required to complete the contracted scope of work, including assumptions and estimates relative to the length of time to complete the project and the nature and complexity of the work to be performed and resources engaged. The Company regularly monitors these estimates throughout the execution of the project and records changes in the period in which a change in an estimate is determined. If a change in an estimate results in a projected loss on a project, such loss is recognized in the period in which it is first identified.
iii.
Revenue from the Company’s software and related services contracts, which are not significant, are primarily related to annual maintenance renewals or incremental license fees for additional users. Maintenance revenues are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the annual contract term. Fees for incremental license without any associated services are recognized at the point in time upon delivery of the related incremental license. 
F-11
Table of Contents
EXLSERVICE HOLDINGS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(continued)
December 31, 2024
(In thousands, except per share amount and share count)
To a lesser extent, certain contracts may include offerings such as sale of licenses, which may be perpetual or subscription-based. The Company recognizes revenue from distinct perpetual licenses upfront at a point in time when the software is made available to the client, whereas for a combined software license and services performance obligation, revenue is recognized over the period that the services are performed.
Revenue from distinct subscription based licenses is recognized over the period of service performed. Revenue from any associated maintenance or ongoing support services is recognized over the term of the contract.
iv.
Revenues from payment integrity services having contingent fee arrangements are recognized by the Company at the point in time when a performance obligation is satisfied, which is when it identifies an overpayment claim. In such contracts, the Company’s consideration is contingent upon the actual collections made by its customers and net of any subsequent retraction claims. Based on guidance on “variable consideration” in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
(“ASC Topic 606”), the Company uses its historical experience and projections to determine the expected amount of revenue to be recognized based on the expected consideration to be received from its customers. Any adjustment required due to change in estimates are recorded in the period in which such change is identified. The estimated amount of revenue to be collected from our customers are presented as contract assets within “Other Current Assets”.
Modification to Contracts
The Company’s contracts may be modified to add, remove or change existing performance obligations. The accounting for modifications to contracts involves assessing whether the services added to an existing contract are distinct and whether the pricing is at a standalone selling price. Services added that are distinct and at standalone selling price are accounted on a prospective basis either as a separate contract, or as a termination of existing contract and creation of a new contract.
Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations
The Company’s contracts with customers do not generally bundle different services together except for software and related services contracts, which are not significant, involving implementation services and post contract maintenance services. In such software and related services contracts, revenue is recognized based upon the transaction price allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price.
Allocation of Transaction Price to Performance Obligations
The transaction price is allocated to performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. Standalone selling prices are estimated by reference to the total transaction price less the sum of the observable standalone selling prices of other goods or services promised in the contract. In assessing whether to allocate variable consideration to a specific part of the contract, the Company considers the nature of the variable payment and whether it relates specifically to its efforts to satisfy a specific part of the contract.
Variable Consideration
Variability in the transaction price arises primarily due to service level agreements, volume discounts entailing variability in revenue earned, and contracts under the Company’s payment integrity services whereby the transaction price is based on the estimated amount the Company enables its customers to recover.
The Company considers its historical experience, including trends with similar transactions and expectations regarding the contract in estimating the amount of variable consideration that should be recognized during a period.
The Company believes that the expected value method is most appropriate for determining the variable consideration since the Company has a large number of contracts with a similar nature of transactions/services.
Unbilled Receivables
Unbilled receivables represents revenues recognized for services rendered between the last billing date and the balance sheet date.

EXLSERVICE HOLDINGS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(continued)
December 31, 2024
(In thousands, except per share amount and share count)
Deferred Revenue and Contract Fulfillment Costs
Contract liabilities (deferred revenue) consist of advance billings and billing in excess of revenues recognized. Deferred revenue also includes the amount for which services have been rendered but other conditions of revenue recognition are not met, for example, where the Company does not have an enforceable contract.
Further, the Company also defers any upfront payments collected from its customers attributable to certain process transition activities, with respect to its customers where such activities do not represent separate performance obligations. Revenues related to such transition activities are classified under “Deferred revenue” and “Other non-current liabilities” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and are recognized as (or when) the performance obligation is fulfilled under the contract with customer.
Costs related to such transition activities are contract fulfillment costs, and thereby classified under “Other current assets” and “Other assets” in the consolidated balance sheets, and are recognized over the expected duration of the relationship with customers, under “Cost of revenues” in the consolidated statements of income.
Contract Acquisition Costs
Incremental costs incurred for acquiring contracts, such as sales commissions are contract acquisition costs and thereby classified under “Other current assets” and “Other assets” in the consolidated balance sheets. Such costs are amortized over the expected duration of the relationship with customers and recorded under Selling and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of income.
Upfront Payments Made to Customers
Upfront payments, in nature of deal signing discount or deal signing bonuses made to customers are contract assets and classified under “Other current assets and Other assets” in the consolidated balance sheets. Such costs are amortized over the expected period of benefit and are recorded as an adjustment to transaction price and reduced from revenues.
Out-of-Pocket Expenses
Reimbursements of out-of-pocket expenses received from customers are included as part of revenues.
Payment terms
All contracts entered into by the Company specify the payment terms and are defined for each contract separately. Usual payment terms range between 
30
-
60
 days. The Company does not have any extended payment terms clauses in existing contracts.
Remaining Performance Obligations
The Company does not disclose the value of remaining performance obligations as a result of applying the practical expedient provided in ASC Topic 606, for contracts that meet any of the following criteria:
i.
Contracts with an original expected length of one year or less as determined under ASC Topic 606,
ii.
Contracts for which Company recognize revenue based on the right to invoice for service performed.
(e)
Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of ninety days or less to be cash equivalents. Pursuant to the Company’s investment policy, surplus funds are invested in highly-rated debt mutual funds, money market funds and time deposits to reduce its exposure to market risk with regard to these funds.
The Company’s investment in money market funds is considered as cash equivalents. These investments are accounted for in accordance with the fair value option under ASC Topic 825, 
Financial Instruments
. The fair value is represented by original cost on the acquisition date and the net asset value (“NAV”) as quoted, at each reporting period and any changes in fair value

are included in other income/(expense), net. Gain or loss on the disposal of these investments is calculated using the first in, first out (“FIFO”) method and is included in other income/(expense), net.
Restricted cash includes any cash and cash equivalents that are legally restricted as to withdrawal or usage for the Company’s operations.
For purposes of the statements of cash flows, the Company includes in its cash and cash-equivalent balances those amounts that have been classified as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents.
(f)
Short-Term and Long-Term Investments
The Company’s short-term investments consist of investments in mutual funds and those term deposits with more than three months of original maturity and less than twelve months of remaining maturity as of the reporting date, while long-term investments consist of term deposits with more than twelve months of remaining maturity as of the reporting date and investments in equity affiliate.
The Company’s investments in term deposits with financial institutions are measured and recognized at amortized cost. Interest earned on such investments is included in other income/(expense), net.
The Company’s mutual fund investments are in debt funds invested in India. These investments are accounted for in accordance with the fair value option under ASC Topic 825, 
Financial Instruments
. The fair value is represented by original cost on the acquisition date and the net asset value (“NAV”) as quoted, at each reporting period and any changes in fair value are included in other income/(expense), net. Gain or loss on the disposal of these investments is calculated using the FIFO method and is included in other income/(expense), net.
Investments in equity affiliates are initially recorded at cost and any excess purchase consideration paid over proportionate share of the fair value of the net assets of the investee at the acquisition date is recognized as goodwill. The proportionate share of net income or loss of the investee after its acquisition is recognized in the consolidated statements of income. The Company periodically reviews the carrying value of its investment to determine if there has been any other than temporary decline in carrying value. The investment balance for an investee is increased or decreased for cash contribution and distributions to or from, respectively
.
(g)
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Expected Credit Losses
Accounts

receivable are recorded net of allowances for expected credit losses. The Company evaluates the credit risk of its customers based on a combination of various financial and qualitative factors that may affect the ability of each customer to pay. The Company considered current and anticipated future economic conditions relating to the industries of the Company’s customers and the countries where it operates. In calculating expected credit loss, the Company also considered past payment trends, credit rating and other related credit information for its significant customers to estimate the probability of default in the future. Accounts receivable balances are written-off against the allowance for expected credit losses after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote.
Accounts receivable include unbilled accounts receivable which represent revenues on contracts to be billed, in subsequent periods, as per the terms of the related contracts.
(h)
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost, which is generally comprised of the purchase price for such property or equipment, non-refundable duties and taxes, but excludes any discounts and/or rebates, less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Equipment held under finance leases are capitalized at the commencement of the lease at an amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted for any lease prepayments, initial direct costs and lease incentives, which usually approximate the fair value of the underlying asset. Expenditures for replacements and improvements are capitalized, if they enhance the production capacity and future benefits whereas the costs of maintenance and repairs are charged to earnings as incurred. Advances paid towards acquisition of property and equipment and the cost of property and equipment not yet placed in service before the end of the reporting period, net of impairment, if any, are classified as capital work in progress.

The Company capitalizes certain costs related to the development or enhancements to existing software products to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed and / or used for internal-use. The Company begins to capitalize costs to develop or enhance software when planning stage efforts are successfully completed, management has authorized and committed project funding, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used as intended. Costs incurred prior to meeting these criteria, together with costs incurred for training and maintenance, are expensed as incurred and recorded within “General and administrative expenses” in the Company’s consolidated statements of income. Costs incurred on internally developed software not yet ready for its intended use before the end of the reporting period, net of impairment, if any, are classified as capital work in progress. The Company exercises judgment in determining the point at which various projects may be capitalized, in assessing the ongoing value of the capitalized costs, and in determining the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized.
Annual amortization of internally developed software products meant for sale, lease or otherwise marketing is the greater of the amount computed using the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product or the straight-line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the software product, generally estimated to be up to 
5
 years from the date the product became available for use. Annual amortization of internally developed software products meant for internal-use is based on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the internally developed software products. Amortization of such internally developed software is presented under “Depreciation and amortization expense” in the consolidated statements of income.

Business Combinations, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
ASC Topic 805, 
Business Combinations,
 requires that the acquisition method of accounting be used for all business combinations. The guidance specifies criteria as to intangible assets acquired in a business combination that must be recognized and reported separately from goodwill. Contingent consideration is recognized at its fair value on the acquisition date. A liability resulting from contingent consideration is re-measured to fair value as of each reporting date until the contingency is resolved, whereby such changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. Under ASC Topic 350, 
Intangibles - Goodwill and Other
, all assets and liabilities of the acquired businesses, including goodwill, are assigned to reporting units. Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred under general and administrative expenses.
In addition, assets acquired and liabilities assumed including uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances in connection with business combinations are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. The Company subsequently re-evaluates the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including additional assets and liabilities identified subsequent to acquisition date, with any adjustments to its preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill within the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date).
Goodwill represents the cost of the acquired businesses in excess of the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible net assets purchased in a business combination. The Company undertakes studies to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired and allocates purchase consideration to assets and liabilities, including property and equipment, goodwill and other identifiable intangibles. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least on an annual basis, relying on a number of factors including operating results, business plans and estimated future cash flows of the reporting units to which it is assigned. The Company examines the carrying value and fair value of the reporting unit that includes goodwill as and when the circumstances warrant, to determine whether there are any impairment losses. Refer to Note 10 - Business Combinations, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to the consolidated financial statements. 
The Company performs an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Based on the assessment of events or circumstances, the Company performs a quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment

(In thousands, except per share amount and share count)
if it determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, based on the quantitative impairment analysis, the carrying value of the goodwill of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of such goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. In addition, the Company performs a qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. 
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are initially valued and recognized at fair market value using generally accepted valuation methods appropriate for the type of intangible asset. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over the estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment, if indicators of impairment arise. Amortization of intangible assets with definite lives is presented under “Depreciation and amortization expense” in the consolidated statements of income. The evaluation of impairment is based upon a comparison of the carrying amount of the intangible asset to its fair value, which is calculated using the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the fair value of the intangible assets is less than the carrying amount of the asset, the asset is considered impaired and an impairment expense is recognized equal to any shortfall in the current period.
The Company’s definite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives as listed below using a straight-line method:

Impairment of Long-lived Asset
s
Long-lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Such assets are required to be tested for impairment if the carrying amount of the assets is higher than the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from the assets. Determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions, including determining which undiscounted cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, their amount, and the asset’s residual value, if any. In turn, measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value, which is based on the best information available. The Company derives the required undiscounted cash flow estimates from its historical experience and its internal business plans. To determine fair value, the Company follows the discounted cash flow approach and uses its internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate discount rate and independent appraisals, as appropriate. The impairment amount to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value.
(l)

Derivative Financial Instruments
In the normal course of business, the Company uses derivative instruments to mitigate the exposure from risk of foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations. The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge cash flow risks from forecasted transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies, and interest rate swaps to hedge cash flow risks from its revolving credit facility having variable interest rate obligations. These contracts adhere to the Company’s treasury operations’ objectives and policies to qualify as cash flow hedges, and are with counterparties that are highly rated financial institutions.
Changes in the fair value of these cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”), net of tax. The resultant foreign exchange gain/(loss) upon settlement of cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions are recorded in the consolidated statements of income along with the underlying hedged item in the same line as part of “Cost of revenues,” “General and administrative expenses,” “Selling and marketing expenses,” and “Depreciation and amortization expense,” as applicable. The accumulated changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps

(In thousands, except per share amount and share count)
recognized in AOCI are reclassified to the consolidated statements of income and are presented as a part of “Interest expense” over the term of the contract.
The Company evaluates hedge effectiveness of cash flow hedges at the time a contract is entered into as well as on an ongoing basis. For hedge relationships that are discontinued because the forecasted transaction is not expected to occur by the end of the originally specified period, any related derivative amounts recorded in AOCI are reclassified to earnings.
The Company also uses derivatives instruments consisting of foreign currency forward contracts to hedge intercompany balances and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency, against the risk of foreign currency fluctuations associated with remeasurement of such assets and liabilities to functional currency. These derivatives do not qualify as fair value hedges under ASC Topic 815. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in the consolidated statements of income and are included in foreign exchange gain, net.
The Company also uses foreign currency forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks related to the Company's investment in foreign subsidiaries. Fair value changes on these forward contracts and gains and losses on settlement of such forward contracts are recognized in AOCI as part of the foreign currency translation adjustments and are reclassified to consolidated statements of income when a foreign operation is disposed or partially disposed. 
All of the assets and liabilities related to the Company’s forward contracts are subject to master netting arrangements with each individual counterparty. These master netting arrangements generally provide for net settlement of all outstanding contracts with the counterparty in the case of an event of default or a termination event. The Company has presented all of the assets and liabilities related to these contracts on a gross basis, with no offsets, in its consolidated statements of financial position. There is no financial collateral (including cash collateral) provided or received by the Company related to these contracts.
(m)
Employee Benefits
Contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the consolidated statements of income in the period in which services are rendered by the covered employees. Current service costs for defined benefit plans are recognized in the period to which they relate. The liability in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated annually by the Company using the projected unit credit method.
The Company records annual amounts relating to its defined benefit plans based on calculations that incorporate various actuarial and other assumptions, including discount rates, mortality, assumed rates of return on plan assets, future compensation increases and attrition rates. The Company reviews its assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is appropriate to do so. The effect of modifications to those assumptions is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) (“OCI”) and amortized to net periodic benefit cost over the expected remaining period of service of the covered employees using the corridor method. The Company believes that the assumptions utilized in recording its obligations under its plans are reasonable based on its experience and market conditions. These assumptions may not be within the control of the Company and accordingly it is reasonably possible that these assumptions could change in future periods.
The Company includes the service cost component of the net periodic benefit cost in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the respective employees during the period. The interest cost, expected return on plan assets and amortization of actuarial gains/loss, are included in “
Other income/(expense), net.
” Refer to Note 20 - Employee Benefit Plans to the consolidated financial statements.
The Company recognizes its liabilities for compensated absences depending on whether the obligation is attributable to employee services already rendered, rights to compensated absences vest or accumulate and payment is probable and estimable.
(n)
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense in the consolidated statements of income for awards of equity instruments to employees and non-employee directors based on the grant-date fair value of those awards. The Company 
F-17
Table of Contents
EXLSERVICE HOLDINGS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(continued)
December 31, 2024
(In thousands, except per share amount and share count)
recognizes these compensation costs on straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, or to the date on which retirement eligibility is achieved, if shorter. Forfeitures are accounted when the actual forfeitures occur.
Under the Company’s 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2018 Plan”), which was adopted by the Company's stockholders on June 15, 2018, which replaces and supersedes the 2015 Amendment and Restatement of the Company’s 2006 Omnibus Award Plan (the “Prior Plan”) and is effective upon the date approved by the Company’s stockholders, the Company grants performance-based restricted stock units (“PRSU”) to executive officers and other specified employees. Generally, the Company grants PRSUs that cliff vest based on an aggregated revenue target (“PU”) for a 
three-year
 period, and PRSUs that are based on market conditions (“MU”) and cliff vest upon meeting or exceeding the Company's total shareholder return relative to a group of peer companies specified under the 2018 Plan, and are measured over a 
three-year
 performance period. The award recipient may earn up to 
200
% of the PRSUs granted based on the actual achievement of the respective targets. However, the features of the equity incentive compensation program are subject to change by the Compensation and Talent Management Committee of the Company’s board of directors.
The fair value of each PU is determined based on the market price of one common share of the Company on the day prior to the date of grant, and the associated compensation expense is calculated on the basis that performance targets at 
100
% are probable of being achieved. The compensation expense for the PU is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period, which is through the end of the third year. Over this period, the number of shares that will be issued is adjusted upward or downward based upon the probability of achievement of the performance targets. The final number of shares issued and the related compensation cost recognized as an expense will be based on a comparison of the final performance metrics to the specified targets. The expense related to the unvested PU as of December 31, 2024 was based on the Company's assessment of performance criteria for these grants that would most likely be met during the respective years of vesting against the targeted performance level.
The grant date fair value for the MUs is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model and the related compensation expense is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. All compensation expense related to the MU will be recognized if the requisite performance period is fulfilled, regardless of the extent of the market condition achieved.
Stock-based compensation expense associated with the Company's 2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) is measured at fair-value using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model at the commencement of each offering period and recognized over that offering period.
(o)
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. The Company calculates and provides for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which it operates. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and all operating losses carried forward, if any. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the applicable temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates or tax status is recognized in the statements of income in the period in which the change is identified. The Company releases (reclassifies) the tax effects from AOCI to the consolidated statements of income at the time of settlement of cash flows hedges and amortization of deferred actuarial gain/(loss) on retirement benefits. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
The Company establishes provisions for uncertain tax provisions and related interest and penalties when the Company believes those tax positions are not more likely than not of being sustained, if challenged.
The Company has indefinitely reinvested earnings from its foreign subsidiaries through December 31, 2023, and has not recorded deferred tax liabilities for such earnings. Beginning 2024, the Company is not indefinitely investing current year earnings of the Company’s foreign disregarded subsidiaries and is not recording any deferred tax liabilities. However, the Company continues to indefinitely reinvest earnings from its controlled foreign corporation subsidiaries and has not recorded deferred tax liabilities for such earnings.

(p)
Concentration of Credit Risk in Financial Instruments
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, time deposits, mutual fund investments, accounts receivable and derivative financial instruments. By their nature, all such financial instruments involve risks including the credit risks of non-performance by counterparties. Pursuant to the Company’s investment policy, surplus funds are maintained as cash equivalents and short-term investments, and are invested in highly-rated mutual funds, money market funds and time deposits, placed with highly rated financial institutions to reduce its exposure to market risk with regard to these funds. The Company’s exposure to credit risk on account receivable is influenced mainly by the individual characteristic of each customer and the concentration of risk from the top few customer
s.
 To mitigate this risk the Company evaluates the creditworthiness of its customers in conjunction with its revenue recognition processes as well as through its ongoing collectability assessment processes for accounts receivable. The Company does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
(q)
Fair value measurements
ASC Topic 820, 
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
 defines fair value as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability. The fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability as against assumptions specific to the entity. In addition, the fair value of liabilities should include consideration of non-performance risk, including the Company’s own credit risk. The fair value hierarchy consists of the following three levels:
•
Level I — Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
•
Level II — Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.
•
Level III — Instruments whose significant value drivers are unobservable.
(r)
Leases
The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception of the contract. The Company’s assessment is based on whether: (1) the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (2) the Company obtains the right to substantially all the economic benefit from the use of the asset throughout the term of the contract, and (3) the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. A lease is classified as a finance lease if any one of the following criteria are met: (1) the lease transfers ownership of the asset by the end of the lease term, (2) the lease contains an option to purchase the asset that is reasonably certain to be exercised, (3) the lease term is for a major part of the remaining useful life of the asset or (4) the present value of the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the asset. 
Operating leases are presented within “Operating lease right-of-use assets,” “Current portion of operating lease liabilities” and “Operating lease liabilities, less current portion” in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. Long-lived assets underlying finance leases are presented within “Property and equipment”

and the current and non-current portion of finance lease liabilities are presented within “Accrued expenses and other current liabilities - others” and “other non-current liabilities - others,” respectively, in the Company's consolidated balance sheets.
ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset during the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease arrangement. Lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Operating lease ROU assets are recognized at commencement date in an amount equal to lease liability, adjusted for any lease prepayments, initial direct costs, and lease incentives. For leases in which the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date. The Company determines the incremental borrowing rate by adjusting the benchmark reference rates with appropriate financing spreads applicable to the respective geographies where the leases are entered and lease specific adjustments for the effects of collateral, if applicable. Lease terms includes the effects of options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain at commencement of the lease that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for operating lease arrangements is recognized on a 
F-19

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(continued)

(In thousands, except per share amount and share count)
straight-line basis over the lease term reflecting single operating lease cost. The Company evaluates lease agreements to determine lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for separately.
Lease payments that depend on factors other than an index or rate are considered variable lease payments and are excluded from the operating lease assets and liabilities and are recognized as expense in the period in which the obligation is incurred. Lease payments include payments for common area maintenance, utilities such as electricity, heating and water, among others, and property taxes, and other similar payments paid to the landlord, which are treated as non-lease component.
The Company accounts for lease-related concessions in accordance with guidance in Topic 842, 
Leases
, to determine, on a lease-by-lease basis, whether the concession provided by lessor should be accounted for as a lease modification.
The Company accounts for a modification as a separate contract when it grants an additional right of use not included in the original lease and the increase is commensurate with the standalone price for the additional right of use, adjusted for the circumstances of the particular contract. Modifications which are not accounted for as a separate contract are reassessed as of the effective date of the modification based on its modified terms and conditions and the facts and circumstances as of that date. Upon modification, the Company remeasures the lease liability to reflect changes to the remaining lease payments and discount rates and recognizes the amount of the remeasurement of the lease liability as an adjustment to the ROU assets. However, if the carrying amount of the ROU assets is reduced to zero as a result of modification, any remaining amount of the remeasurement is recognized as an expense in consolidated statements of income.
The Company reviews ROU assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount may not be recoverable.
(s)
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, adjusted for outstanding shares that are subject to repurchase during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares issued and outstanding during the period plus the potentially dilutive effect of common stock equivalents, including, outstanding stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and employee stock purchase plans. For the purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share, the treasury stock method is used for stock-based awards. The Company includes performance stock unit awards in dilutive potential common shares when they become contingently issuable and have a dilutive impact per authoritative guidance and excludes such awards when they are not contingently issuable.
(t)
Commitments and Contingencies
Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties, and other sources are recognized when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment and/or remediation can be reasonably estimated. A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation that may require an outflow of resources. When there is a possible obligation or a present obligation in respect of which the likelihood of outflow of resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made. Legal costs incurred in connection with such liabilities are expensed as incurred. Capital commitments are disclosed in the financial statements.

Business Combinations, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Incandescent Technologies, Inc.
On August 1, 2024, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary Clairvoyant AI, Inc., completed the acquisition of ITI Data, a Nebraska corporation, pursuant to an equity securities purchase agreement dated July 31, 2024 (the "Purchase Agreement"). The Company purchased 
100
% of the issued and outstanding equity securities in ITI Data. The ITI Data acquisition is treated as a stock acquisition for tax purposes.
ITI Data is a data management solutions firm that works with the global banks, financial services and healthcare companies. It delivers enterprise business solutions for clients processing significant data volumes with complex data management requirements. The acquisition strengthens the Company’s ability to deliver reliable, data-driven insights to its clients and ultimately drive greater value and innovation across their operations.
The Company’s purchase price allocation to net tangible and intangible assets of ITI Data as at August 1, 2024 is as follows:
Intangible assets 
$
12,800

Other assets, net 
220

Goodwill
15,335

Total purchase consideration 
(1)
$
28,355

(1) Includes contingent consideration of $
2,700
 recognized at fair value as of the date of acquisition.
In connection with this acquisition, the Company recorded $
12,500
 in customer-related intangibles which are being amortized on a straight-line basis (which approximates the economic pattern of benefits) over the estimated weighted average amortization period of 
5
 years.
The goodwill recognized represents the acquired capabilities, operating synergies and other benefits expected to result from combining the acquired operations with the Company’s existing operations. The goodwill has been assigned to the Company’s Analytics reportable segment based upon the Company’s assessment of nature of services rendered by ITI Data. 
The results of operations of the acquired business and the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements with effect from the date of the acquisition. The acquisition did not materially impact the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows, and therefore, the Company has not provided any supplemental pro forma results.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized measurement period adjustments, which led to decrease in goodwill in an amount of $
6,700
. These adjustments primarily relate to a change in fair value of contingent consideration and customer-related intangible assets and did not have any significant impact on “Depreciation and amortization” expense in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2024.
During 2024 and 2023, the Company performed an assessment to determine whether events or circumstances exist that may lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Based on such assessment, the Company concluded that there was 
no
 impairment on goodwill as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss)
Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) consists of actuarial gain/(loss) on retirement benefits and foreign currency translation adjustments. In addition, the Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps, which are designated as cash flow hedges and net investment hedges, as applicable, in accordance with ASC Topic 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging
. Cumulative changes in the fair values of cash flow hedges are recognized in AOCI on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The fair value changes are reclassified from AOCI to consolidated statements of income upon settlement of foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges of a forecast transaction, whereas such changes for interest rate swaps are reclassified over the term of the contract. Fair value changes related to net investment hedges are included in AOCI and are reclassified to consolidated statements of income when a foreign operation is disposed or partially disposed. 
The following table sets forth the changes in AOCI during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:

Fair Value of Derivative Financial Instruments
:
The Company’s derivative financial instruments consist of foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps. Fair values for derivative financial instruments are based on independent sources including highly rated financial institutions and are classified as Level 2. Refer to Note 17 - Derivatives and Hedge Accounting to the consolidated financial statements for further details.
Fair Value of Contingent Consideration
:
The fair value measurement of contingent consideration is determined using Level 3 inputs. The Company’s contingent consideration represents a component of the total purchase consideration for business acquisitions. The measurement is calculated using unobservable inputs based on the Company’s own assessment of achievement of certain performance goals. The Company estimated the fair value of the contingent consideration based on the Monte Carlo simulation model.

Financial Instruments Not Carried at Fair Value
: 
The Company’s other financial instruments not carried at fair value consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents (except investments in money market funds, as disclosed above), short-term investments (except investments in mutual funds, as disclosed above), restricted cash, accounts receivable, net, long-term investments, accrued capital expenditures, accrued expenses, client liabilities and interest payable on borrowings for which fair values approximate their carrying amounts. The carrying value of the Company’s outstanding revolving credit facility approximates its fair value because the Company’s interest rate yield is near current market rates for comparable debt instruments.
17. 
Derivatives and Hedge Accounting
The Company uses derivative instruments to mitigate cash flow volatility from risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge cash flow risks from forecasted transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies, and interest rate swaps to hedge cash flow risks from its revolving credit facility having variable interest rate obligations. These contracts qualify as cash flow hedges under ASC Topic 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging
, and are with counterparties that are highly rated financial institutions.
The following table sets forth the aggregate notional amount of derivatives in cash flow hedging relationship:
As of
December 31, 2024

Foreign currency forward contracts denominated in:
Sell U.S. dollar (USD)
984,300

—

75,000

The Company estimates that approximately $
5,693
 of derivative losses, net, excluding tax effects, included in AOCI, representing changes in the value of cash flow hedges based on exchange rates prevailing as of December 31, 2024, could be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2024, the maximum outstanding term of the cash flow hedges was approximately 
45
 months.
The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its intercompany balances and other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currencies, against the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates associated with remeasurement of such assets and liabilities to functional currency. These foreign currency forward contracts do not qualify as fair value hedges under ASC Topic 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging
. Changes in the fair value of these financial instruments are recognized in the consolidated statements of income and are included in the foreign exchange gain/(loss) line item. The Company’s primary exchange rate exposure is with the Indian rupee (INR), the Philippine peso (PHP), the U.K. pound sterling (GBP) and South African rand (ZAR). The Company also has exposure to the Colombian peso (COP), the Euro (EUR), the Australian dollar (AUD), the Canadian dollar (CAD) and other local currencies in which it operates.

 and $

 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, are presented under “Other current assets” and “Other assets,” as applicable, in the consolidated balance sheets. 
Credit Agreement
The Company held a $
300,000
 revolving credit facility pursuant to its credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), dated as of November 21, 2017 with certain lenders and Citibank N.A. as Administrative Agent, which was amended and restated on April 18, 2022 (the “2022 Credit Agreement”), Among other things, the 2022 Credit Agreement (a) provides for the issuance of new revolving credit commitments such that the aggregate amount of revolving credit commitments available as of April 18, 2022  to the Company is equal to $
400,000
; and (b) extends the maturity date of the revolving credit facility from November 21, 2022 to April 18, 2027.
On August 9, 2024, the Company and each of the Company’s wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries entered into a First Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with Citibank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, and certain lenders (the “2024 Credit Agreement”), pursuant to which the parties thereto amended and restated the 2022 Credit Agreement. Among other things, the 2024 Credit Agreement (a) provides for a $
100,000
 increase to the revolving credit commitments such that the aggregate amount of revolving credit commitments available as of August 9, 2024 to the Company is equal to $
500,000
; and (b) provides for the issuance of a new term loan facility in the aggregate amount of $
100,000
 with an annual prepayment amount  of 
5
%. The increased revolving credit facility and the new term loan facility both mature on April 18, 2027.

The 2024 Credit Agreement includes a letter of credit sub facility and is voluntarily pre-payable from time to time without premium or penalty. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility can be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions. Borrowings of $
100,000
 under the term loan facility (which was drawn based on adjusted SOFR) were used to repay the borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility on August 9, 2024.
Obligations under the 2024 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company’s wholly-owned material domestic subsidiaries and are secured by all or substantially all of the Company’s and its material domestic subsidiaries’ assets. The 2024 Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, but not limited to, restrictions on the ability to incur indebtedness, create liens, make certain investments, make certain dividends and distributions, enter into, or undertake, certain liquidations, mergers, consolidations or acquisitions and dispose of certain assets or subsidiaries. In addition, the 2024 Credit Agreement contains a covenant to not permit the interest coverage ratio or the total net leverage ratio for the four consecutive quarter period ending on the last day of each fiscal quarter, to be less than 
3.0
 to 1.0 or more than 
3.5
 to 1.0, respectively.
The 2024 Credit Agreement bears interest at a rate equal to specified prime rate (alternate base rate) or adjusted SOFR, plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin on the revolving credit facility is tied to the Company’s total net leverage ratio and ranges from 
0
% to 
0.75
% per annum on loans pegged to the specified prime rate, and 
0.875
% to 
1.75
% per annum on loans pegged to the adjusted SOFR. The applicable margin on the term loan facility is also tied to the Company’s total net leverage ratio and ranges from 
0.125
% to 
1.00
% per annum on loans pegged to the specified prime rate, and 
1.125
% to 
2.00
% per annum on loans pegged to the adjusted SOFR. The revolving credit commitments under the 2024 Credit Agreement are subject to a commitment fee which is also tied to the Company’s total net leverage ratio, and ranges from 
0.125
% to 
0.275
% per annum on the average daily amount by which the aggregate revolving commitments exceed the sum of outstanding revolving loans and letter of credit obligations.

On October 5, 2021, the Company’s board of directors authorized a $
300,000
 (excluding excise tax) common stock repurchase program beginning January 1, 2022 (the “2022 Repurchase Program”), and terminated the 2019 Repurchase Program on December 31, 2021.
On February 26, 2024, the Company’s board of directors authorized a $
500,000
 (excluding excise tax) common stock repurchase program beginning March 1, 2024 (the “2024 Repurchase Program”), and terminated the 2022 Repurchase Program on February 29, 2024.
On March 15, 2024, the Company entered into a 2024 ASR Agreement with Citibank to repurchase shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $
125,000
, as part of the Company’s 2024 Repurchase Program. Upon payment of the aggregate purchase price of $
125,000
, the Company received an initial delivery of 
3,350,084
 shares of its common stock at an initial price of $
29.85
 per share, representing 
80

Employee Benefit Plans
The Company’s Gratuity Plan in India (the “India Plan”) provides for a lump sum payment to vested employees on retirement or upon termination of employment in an amount based on the respective employee’s salary and years of employment with the Company. In addition, the Company’s subsidiary operating in the Philippines conforms to the minimum regulatory benefit, which provide for lump sum payment to vested employees on retirement from employment in an amount based on the respective employee’s salary and years of employment with the Company (the “Philippines Plan”). Liabilities with regard to the India Plan and the Philippines Plan are determined by actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method. Current service costs for these plans are accrued in the year to which they relate. Actuarial gains or losses or prior service costs, if any, resulting from amendments to the plans are recognized and amortized over the remaining period of service of the employees.
The India Plan is partially funded whereas the Philippines Plan is unfunded. The Company makes annual contributions to the India Plan established with insurance companies. Fund managers manage these funds and calculate the annual contribution required to be made by the Company and manage the India Plan, including any required payouts. These funds are managed on a cash accumulation basis, inclusive of interest which is declared periodically. The Company earned a return of approximately 
7.2
% per annum on the India Plan for the year ended December 31, 2024.

62,936
 and $
53,536
 for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in income tax expense was primarily as a result of higher profit, increase in non-deductible expenses and lower excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, partially offset by decrease in foreign tax rate differential during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, some of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries repatriated $
38,161
 (net of $
2,649
 withholding taxes) to the United States. As of December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, accumulated net earnings generated by our foreign operations were approximately $

 and $
546,828
 respectively, of which $
635,396
 and $
546,828
 respectively, are indefinitely reinvested. Because most of the accumulated net earnings generated by our foreign operations has already been taxed for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes, any additional taxes due with respect to the repatriation of such earnings would generally be limited to the tax effect of currency gains or losses recognized on repatriation and foreign withholding taxes.

The Company performed an analysis of the realizability of deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, and recorded a valuation allowance of $
3,172
 and $

The Company’s income tax expense also includes provisions established for uncertain income tax positions determined in accordance with ASC Topic 740, 
Income Taxes
. The Company monitors and adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made.

Share Matching Program
Under the Company’s 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2018 Plan”), the Company established a share matching program (“SMP”) for executive officers and other specified employees. Under the SMP, the Company agreed to issue a number of restricted stock units equal to the number of newly acquired shares of the Company's common stock. For purposes of the match, “newly acquired shares” includes the employee’s first quarter 2022 open market purchase of the common stock, and

crediting of equity awards vesting under any existing stock award plan of the Company as having been purchased by such employees, in an amount between $
100
 to $
500
 per such employee.
The matching restricted stock units granted under the SMP will vest in 
two
 installments, with one-third to vest on the second anniversary of the grant date and the remaining two-thirds to vest on the third anniversary of the grant date; the newly acquired shares for which the matching restricted stock units were granted must also be held by the employee until such vesting dates. The Company’s underlying common stock issued pursuant to the vesting of the matching restricted stock units will not be marketable or transferable for a period of 
two years
 following the vesting date. Certain forfeiture and other conditions apply.

Restricted Stock Units
The Committee is authorized to award restricted stock units to participants. The Committee establishes the terms, conditions and restrictions applicable to each award of restricted stock units, including the time or times at which restricted stock units will be granted or vested and the number of units to be covered by each award. The terms and conditions of each restricted stock award will be reflected in a restricted stock unit agreement.
Any cash or in-kind dividends paid with respect to unvested shares of restricted stock units are withheld by the Company and paid to the holder of such shares of restricted stock, without interest, only if and when such shares of restricted stock units vest. Any unvested shares of restricted stock units are immediately forfeited without consideration upon the termination of holder’s employment with the Company or its affiliates. Accordingly, the Company’s unvested restricted stock units do not include non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents and are therefore not considered as participating securities for purposes of earnings per share calculations pursuant to the two-class method.

Performance-Based Stock Awards
Under the 2018 Plan, the Company grants performance-based restricted stock units (“PRSUs”) to executive officers and other specified employees. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company granted 
40
% of each award recipient’s equity grants in the form of PRSUs that cliff vest at the end of a 
three-year
 period based on an aggregated revenue target for a 
three-year
 period (“PU”). The remaining 
60
% of each award recipient’s equity grants are PRSUs that are based on market conditions contingent on the Company's meeting the total shareholder return relative to a group of peer companies specified under the 2018 Plan, and are measured over a 
three-year
 performance period (“MU”).
The fair value of each PU is determined based on the market price of one common share on a day prior to the date of grant, and the associated stock compensation expense is calculated on the basis that performance targets at 
100
% are probable of being achieved. The stock compensation expense for the PUs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period, which is through the end of the third year. Over this period, the number of shares that will be issued are adjusted upward or downward based upon the probability of achievement of the performance targets. The final number of shares issued and the related compensation cost recognized as an expense is based on a comparison of the final performance metrics to the specified targets.
The grant date fair value for each MU is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model and the related stock compensation expense is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The stock compensation expense related to the MUs is recognized once the requisite performance period is fulfilled regardless of the extent of the market condition achieved.
The Monte Carlo simulation model simulates a range of possible future stock prices and estimates the probabilities of the potential payouts. This model also incorporates the following ranges of assumptions:
•
The historical volatilities are used over the most recent 
three-year
 period for the components of the peer group.
•
The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury rate assumption commensurate with the 
three-year
 performance period.

•
Since the plan stipulates that the awards are based upon the TSR of the Company and the components of the peer group, it is assumed that the dividends get reinvested in the issuing entity on a continuous basis.
•
The correlation coefficients are used to model the way in which each entity tends to move in relation to each other are based upon the price data used to calculate the historical volatilities.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
On June 21, 2022, at the annual meeting of stockholders of the Company, the Company’s stockholders approved the ExlService Holdings, Inc. 2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “2022 ESPP”).
The 2022 ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase the Company’s shares of common stock through payroll deductions at a pre-specified discount to the lower of closing price of the Company’s common shares on the date of offering or the last business day of each purchase interval. The dollar amount of shares of common stock that can be purchased under the 2022 ESPP must not exceed 
15
% of the participating employee’s compensation during the offering period, subject to a cap of $
25
 per employee per calendar year. The Company has reserved 
4,000,000
 shares of common stock for issuance under the 2022 ESPP.
The fifth offering period under the 2022 ESPP commenced on July 1, 2024 with a term of 
six months

Other Commitments
Certain units of the Company’s Indian subsidiaries were established as 
100
% Export-Oriented units or under the Software Technology Parks of India or Special Economic Zone scheme promulgated by the Government of India. These units are exempt from customs, central excise duties, and levies on imported and indigenous capital goods, stores, and spares. The Company has undertaken to pay custom duties, service taxes, levies, and liquidated damages payable, if any, in respect of imported and indigenous capital goods, stores and spares consumed duty free, in the event that certain terms and conditions are not fulfilled. The Company believes, however, that these units have in the past satisfied, and will continue to satisfy, the required conditions.
The Company’s operations centers in the Philippines are registered as qualified Philippines Economic Zone Authority units, which provides the Company fiscal incentives on the import of capital goods and local purchase of services and materials. The Company is required to meet certain requirements to retain the incentives. The Company has complied and intends to continue compliance with the requirements to avail itself of the incentives.
Contingencies
The transfer pricing regulations in the countries where the Company operates require that controlled intercompany transactions be at arm’s-length. Accordingly, the Company determines and documents pricing for controlled intercompany transactions based on an economic analysis as prescribed in the respective regulations. The tax authorities have jurisdiction to review the Company’s transfer pricing. If the Company’s transfer pricing is challenged by the authorities, they could assess additional tax, interest and penalties, thereby impacting the Company’s profitability and cash flows.
The Company is currently involved in transfer pricing and related income tax disputes with Indian tax authorities. The aggregate amount demanded by Indian tax authorities (net of advance payments) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 is $
49,588
 and $
36,694
, respectively. The Company has made payments and/or provided bank guarantees against these demands in the amounts of $
7,506
 and $
7,227
, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company believes that its positions will more likely than not be sustained upon final examination by the tax authorities, and accordingly has not accrued any liabilities with respect to these matters in its consolidated financial statements.
India’s VAT regime ended in June 2017 and was replaced by the current Goods and Service Tax (“GST”) regime. Pursuant to reviewing the Company’s annual VAT filings, the Indian tax authorities raised aggregate VAT demands for tax years 2015 and 2017, in the amounts of $
5,339
 and $
5,493
, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company has provided bank guarantees against these demands in the amounts of $
5,339
 and $
4,570
, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The GST authorities rejected the Company’s refunds claims in the amounts of $
5,885
 and $
4,748
 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company has filed appeals against these matters and believes that it is more likely than not that upon final examination its position will be sustained based on its technical merits. Accordingly, no provision was recognized as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Some of the Company’s subsidiaries in India have undergone assessments with the statutory authority with respect to defined contribution plan. Except for some components of the assessments for which the Company has recognized a provision in the financial statements, the Company believes that the amount demanded by such authority is not a meaningful indicator of the potential liabilities of the Company, and that these matters are without merit. The Company is defending against the assessment orders and in one case, has instituted an appeal against the order before the relevant tribunal while also making a payment under protest of the amount demanded. As of the reporting date, the Company’s management does not believe that the ultimate assessments in any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The Company will continue to monitor and evaluate its position based on future events and developments on these matters.
From time to time, the Company, its subsidiaries, and/or their present officers or directors, may be or have been, named as a defendant in litigation matters, including employment-related claims. The plaintiffs in those cases seek damages, including, where applicable, compensatory damages, punitive damages and attorney’s fees. With respect to pending litigation matters as of the reporting date, the Company believes that the damages claimed are without merit, and the Company intends to vigorously defend them. The Company will continuously monitor developments on these matters to assess potential impacts to the financial statements.

The outcomes of legal actions are unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and thus it is inherently difficult to determine the likelihood of the Company incurring a material loss or quantification of any such loss. With respect to certain pending litigation matters as of the reporting date, the Company has made provisions based on information currently available, including its evaluation of the facts underlying each matter and legal counsel’s advice on the estimated losses or range of reasonably possible losses. Based on the Company’s assessment, including the availability of insurance recoveries, the Company’s management does not believe that currently pending litigation, individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The Company will continuously monitor these matters to assess potential impacts to the financial statements.
