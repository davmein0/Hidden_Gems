All statements included in this report, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements, including but not limited to statements incorporating the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “plan,” “intend” and “forecast,” as well as similar expressions and statements regarding our business strategy, plans and objectives for future operations. The absence of such words, expressions or statements, however, does not mean that the statements are not forward-looking. Any such forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to future events, based on what we believe to be reasonable assumptions. Certain factors could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from the results or outcomes anticipated in the forward-looking statements. The most important of these factors include, but are not limited to:
•
our expected receipt of, and amounts of, distributions from Plains AAP, L.P., and the effect thereof on our ability to pay distributions to our Class A shareholders;
•
general economic, market or business conditions in the United States and elsewhere (including the potential for a recession or significant slowdown in economic activity levels, the risk of persistently high inflation and supply chain issues, the impact of global public health events, such as pandemics, on demand and growth, and the timing, pace and extent of economic recovery) that impact (i) demand for crude oil, drilling and production activities and therefore the demand for the midstream services we provide and (ii) commercial opportunities available to us;
•
declines in global crude oil demand and/or crude oil prices or other factors that correspondingly lead to a significant reduction of North American crude oil and natural gas liquids (“NGL”) production (whether due to reduced producer cash flow to fund drilling activities or the inability of producers to access capital, or both, the unavailability of pipeline and/or storage capacity, the shutting-in of production by producers, government-mandated pro-ration orders, or other factors), which in turn could result in significant declines in the actual or expected volume of crude oil and NGL shipped, processed, purchased, stored, fractionated and/or gathered at or through the use of our assets and/or the reduction of the margins we can earn or the commercial opportunities that might otherwise be available to us;
•
fluctuations in refinery capacity and other factors affecting demand for various grades of crude oil and NGL and resulting changes in pricing conditions or transportation throughput requirements;
•
unanticipated changes in crude oil and NGL market structure, grade differentials and volatility (or lack thereof);
•
the effects of competition and capacity overbuild in areas where we operate, including downward pressure on rates, volumes and margins, contract renewal risk and the risk of loss of business to other midstream operators who are willing or under pressure to aggressively reduce transportation rates in order to capture or preserve customers;
•
the successful operation of joint ventures and joint operating arrangements PAA enters into from time to time, whether relating to assets operated by PAA or by third parties, and the successful integration and future performance of acquired assets or businesses;
•
the availability of, and PAA’s ability to consummate, acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures or other strategic opportunities and realize benefits therefrom;
•
environmental liabilities, litigation or other events that are not covered by an indemnity, insurance or existing reserves;
•
negative societal sentiment regarding the hydrocarbon energy industry and the continued development and consumption of hydrocarbons, which could influence consumer preferences and governmental or regulatory actions that adversely impact our business;
•
the occurrence of a natural disaster, catastrophe, terrorist attack (including eco-terrorist attacks) or other event that materially impacts our operations, including cyber or other attacks on our or our service providers’ electronic and computer systems;
•
weather interference with business operations or project construction, including the impact of extreme weather events or conditions (including hurricanes, floods, wildfires and drought);
•
the impact of current and future laws, rulings, legislation, governmental regulations, executive orders, trade policies, trade tariffs, accounting standards and statements, and related interpretations that (i) prohibit, restrict or regulate the development of oil and gas resources and the related infrastructure on lands dedicated to or served by our pipelines, (ii) negatively impact our ability to develop, operate or repair midstream assets, or (iii) otherwise negatively impact our business or increase our exposure to risk;

Items 1 and 2.  
Business and Properties
General
Plains GP Holdings, L.P. is a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership that has elected to be taxed as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes. PAGP’s Class A shares are listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (“Nasdaq”) under the ticker symbol “PAGP.” PAGP does not directly own any operating assets; as of December 31, 2024, its sole source of cash flow is derived from an indirect investment in Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (“PAA”), a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership, through its limited partner interest in Plains AAP, L.P. (“AAP”). We also own a 100% managing member interest in Plains All American GP LLC (“GP LLC”), a Delaware limited liability company that holds the non-economic general partner interest in AAP. 
PAA’s business model integrates large-scale supply aggregation capabilities with the ownership and operation of critical midstream infrastructure systems that connect major producing regions to key demand centers and export terminals. As one of the largest crude oil midstream service providers in North America, PAA owns an extensive network of pipeline transportation, terminalling, storage and gathering assets in key crude oil and NGL producing basins (including the Permian Basin) and transportation corridors and at major market hubs in the United States and Canada. PAA’s assets and the services it provides are primarily focused on crude oil and NGL.
PAA’s business is based on the fundamental thesis that hydrocarbons are essential to the security and advancement of human quality of life and will continue to play a major long-term role in the world economy. Midstream energy infrastructure provides a critical link between energy supply and demand, and is fundamental to the maintenance and advancement of our modern-day standard of living. Acknowledging the need for multiple forms of energy to meet growing world-wide demand, we believe absolute hydrocarbon demand will increase over time, driven by global population growth and a desire to improve quality of life in lesser developed countries throughout the world, and that North American crude oil and NGL production will be required to support the growth in demand. Furthermore, we believe existing energy infrastructure will play a critical role in supporting emerging energy and energy transition initiatives. As a result, we believe that midstream energy infrastructure will remain a critical and valuable component of the energy industry value chain.
PAA’s assets are owned, and its operations are conducted, directly and indirectly through its primary operating subsidiaries. As used in this Form 10-K and unless the context indicates otherwise (taking into account the fact that PAGP has no operating activities apart from those conducted by PAA and its subsidiaries), the terms “Partnership,” “Plains,” “we,” “us,” “our,” “ours” and similar terms refer to PAGP and its subsidiaries. 
References to the “PAGP Entities” include PAA GP Holdings LLC (“PAGP GP”), PAGP, GP LLC, AAP and PAA GP LLC (“PAA GP”). References to the “Plains Entities” include the PAGP Entities and PAA and its subsidiaries.

Organizational Structure
The diagram below shows our organizational structure as of December 31, 2024 in a summarized format:

Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
(1)
Each Class C share represents a non-economic limited partner interest in us. The Class C shares function as a “pass-through” voting mechanism through which PAA votes at the direction of and as proxy for the PAA common unitholders (other than AAP) and Series A preferred unitholders on the election of directors. The number of Class C shares that PAA owns is equal to the number of outstanding PAA common units and Series A Preferred units (“PAA Common Unit Equivalents”) that are entitled to vote, pro rata with the holders of our Class A and Class B shares, for the election of eligible PAGP GP directors. PAA Series B preferred units, which are non-voting securities, and PAA common units held by AAP, which already participate in such elections through our Class A and Class B shares, are not entitled to vote in the election of directors.
(2)
On January 31, 2025, PAA repurchased approximately 12.7 million Series A Preferred Units. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding this repurchase.
(3)
PAA holds (i) direct and indirect ownership interests in consolidated operating subsidiaries including, but not limited to, Plains Marketing, L.P., Plains Pipeline, L.P., Plains Midstream Canada ULC (“PMC ULC”), Plains Oryx Permian Basin LLC (the “Permian JV”), Cactus II Pipeline LLC (“Cactus II”) and Red River Pipeline Company LLC (“Red River”) and (ii) indirect equity interests in unconsolidated entities including, but not limited to, BridgeTex Pipeline Company, LLC, Capline Pipeline Company LLC, Diamond Pipeline LLC, Eagle Ford Pipeline LLC, Eagle Ford Terminals Corpus Christi LLC, Saddlehorn Pipeline Company, LLC, White Cliffs Pipeline, L.L.C. and Wink to Webster Pipeline LLC.
Our Business Strategy
Unless we directly acquire and hold assets or businesses in the future, our cash flows will be generated solely from the cash distributions we receive on the Class A units of AAP (“AAP units”) we own. AAP currently receives all of its cash flows from distributions on the PAA common units it owns.
Accordingly, our primary business objective is to increase our cash available for distribution to our Class A shareholders through the execution by PAA of its business strategy. In addition, we may facilitate PAA’s growth activities through various means, including, but not limited to, making loans, purchasing equity interests or providing other forms of financial support to PAA. 
We maintain a one-to-one relationship between our Class A shares and the underlying PAA common units in which we have an indirect economic interest through our ownership interest in AAP (referred to as “Economic Parity”), such that the number of our outstanding Class A shares equals the number of AAP units we own, which in turn equals the number of PAA common units held by AAP attributable to our ownership interest in AAP. 
PAA’s Business Strategy
PAA’s principal business strategy is to provide competitive and efficient midstream infrastructure and logistics services to producers, refiners and other customers. PAA strives to address regional supply and demand imbalances for crude oil and NGL in the United States and Canada by combining the strategic location and capabilities of its transportation, terminalling, storage, processing and fractionation assets with its commercial expertise. PAA intends to execute its strategy by:
•
Focusing on operational excellence, continuous improvement and running a safe, reliable, and environmentally and socially responsible operation;
•
Using its well-positioned network of midstream infrastructure in conjunction with its commercial capabilities to provide its customers with market access, flexibility and value chain solutions, capture market opportunities, address physical market imbalances and generate and grow sustainable cash flow and margin while maintaining an acceptable risk profile;
•
Optimizing and enhancing its asset portfolio and operations (through disciplined and accretive capital investments and the pursuit of emerging energy opportunities) to maximize returns on invested capital; and
•
Pursuing a balanced, long-term financial strategy that is focused on maintaining an investment grade credit profile and enhancing financial flexibility by making disciplined capital allocation decisions.

Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
We believe PAA’s successful execution of this strategy will enable it to generate and grow sustainable earnings and cash flow, and will position PAA to maintain an investment grade credit profile and increase returns to equity holders over time. 
PAA’s Competitive Strengths

We believe that the following competitive strengths position PAA to successfully execute its principal business strategy:
•
PAA owns a strategically located, geographically diverse and interconnected large-scale asset base that provides operational flexibility and commercial optionality.
 The majority of PAA’s transportation assets are in crude oil service, are located in well-established crude oil producing regions (with PAA’s largest asset presence in the Permian Basin) and other transportation corridors and are connected, directly or indirectly, with PAA’s terminals and facilities assets. The majority of PAA’s terminals and facilities assets are located at major trading locations and premium markets that serve as gateways to major North American refinery and distribution markets and key export terminals where PAA has strong business relationships. In addition, PAA’s pipeline, rail, truck and storage assets provide PAA’s customers and PAA with significant flexibility and optionality to satisfy demand, balance markets, and participate in emerging energy opportunities.
•
PAA’s full-service integrated model and long-term focus attracts a broad, diverse and high-quality customer base that supports sustainable fee-based cash flow generation.
  PAA’s strategically located and interconnected asset base enables it to provide its customers with a wide variety of services, including supply aggregation, quality segregation, flow assurance and market access.  PAA focuses on building long-term relationships and alignment of interests with its customers. PAA believes this approach has helped it build a high-quality portfolio of customers and contracts (including long-term, third-party transportation contracts and acreage dedication contracts) that provide long-term volume support for its assets and, in turn, support long-term fee-based cash flow generation from its assets. 
•
PAA possesses specialized crude oil and NGL market knowledge. 
 We believe PAA’s business relationships with participants in various phases of the crude oil and NGL distribution chain, from producers to refiners, as well as PAA’s own industry expertise (including PAA’s knowledge of North American crude oil and NGL flows), provide PAA with extensive market insight and an understanding of the North American physical crude oil and NGL markets that enables PAA to provide value chain solutions for its customers.
•
PAA’s merchant activities provide it with the opportunity to realize incremental margins. 
We believe the variety of its merchant activities provides PAA with a low-risk opportunity to generate incremental margin, the amount of which may vary depending on market conditions (such as differentials and certain competitive factors). 
•
PAA has the financial, strategic and technical skills needed to execute strategic transactions that support its business and financial objectives, including joint ventures, joint ownership arrangements, acquisitions and divestitures.
 PAA is a party to more than 25 joint ventures and/or joint ownership arrangements (including the Permian JV that was formed in October 2021) with strategic partners that support the success of the applicable project or investment.
•
PAA has an experienced management team whose interests are aligned with those of its equity holders.
 PAA’s executive management team has an average of 30+ years of experience spanning across all sectors of the energy industry and an average of over 15 years of experience with PAA or its predecessors and affiliates. In addition, through their ownership of PAA equity interests and grants of long-term equity incentive awards, PAA’s management team has a vested interest in PAA’s continued success that is aligned with the interests of PAA’s equity holders.
Our Financial Strategy
Our financial strategy is designed to be complementary to PAA’s financial and business strategies. Our only cash-generating asset is our limited partner interest in AAP, which currently receives all of its cash flows from distributions on the PAA common units it owns. 
8
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
We have entered into an Omnibus Agreement with the Plains Entities which provides for (i) our ability to issue additional Class A shares and use the net proceeds therefrom to purchase a like number of AAP units from AAP, and the corresponding ability of AAP to use the net proceeds therefrom to purchase a like number of PAA common units from PAA and (ii) our ability to lend proceeds of any future indebtedness we incur to AAP, and AAP’s corresponding ability to lend such proceeds to PAA, in each case on substantially the same terms as we incur.
Accordingly, we may access the equity capital markets from time to time to enhance the financial position of PAA and its ability to compete for incremental capital opportunities (including organic investments and third-party acquisitions) to drive future growth. We currently do not intend to incur any indebtedness in the near term. We would expect to fund direct acquisitions made by us, if any, with a combination of debt and equity.
PAA’s Financial Strategy 

PAA’s financial strategy and long-term capital allocation framework is focused on generating meaningful multi-year free cash flow and improving shareholder returns by (i) increasing returns of capital to equity holders, primarily through increased distributions, (ii) making disciplined accretive investments and (iii) maintaining an investment grade credit profile and ensuring balance sheet flexibility. Since the completion of its initial public offering in 1998, PAA has completed and integrated over 100 acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price of approximately $14.7 billion, implemented investment capital projects totaling approximately $18.1 billion, returned $19.3 billion to its equity holders, primarily in the form of distributions, and enhanced its credit rating to investment grade from non-investment grade. Additionally, since 2016 PAA has completed more than $4.9 billion of divestitures of non-core assets and/or strategic sales of partial interests in selected assets.
Targeted Credit Profile
As part of PAA’s financial strategy, it intends to maintain a credit profile that it believes is consistent with investment grade credit ratings. PAA targets a credit profile with the following attributes:
•
a leverage multiple averaging between 3.25x to 3.75x, which is calculated as total debt plus 50% of the value of preferred units, divided by Adjusted EBITDA attributable to PAA (this is roughly equivalent to a long-term debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA attributable to PAA multiple of between 2.5x and 3.0x);
•
an average long-term debt-to-total capitalization ratio of approximately 50% or less;
•
an average total debt-to-total capitalization ratio of approximately 60% or less; and
•
an average Adjusted EBITDA-to-interest coverage multiple of approximately 3.3x or better.
See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA attributable to PAA.
At December 31, 2024, PAA’s publicly-traded senior notes comprised approximately 99% of its long-term debt. Additionally, PAA routinely incurs short-term debt primarily in connection with its merchant activities that involve the simultaneous purchase and forward sale of crude oil and NGL. The crude oil and NGL purchased in these transactions are volumetrically hedged. These borrowings are self-liquidating as they are repaid with sales proceeds. PAA also incurs short-term debt to fund New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) and Intercontinental Exchange (“ICE”) margin requirements. In certain market conditions, these routine short-term debt levels may increase above baseline levels. Similar to PAA’s working capital borrowings, these borrowings are self-liquidating. PAA does not consider the working capital borrowings or margin requirements associated with these activities to be part of its long-term capital structure.

Values and Sustainability 
Our Core Values include Safety and Environmental Stewardship; Ownership and Accountability; Respect, Fairness, and Inclusion; Ethics and Integrity; Teamwork; and Entrepreneurship and Innovation. Our Code of Business Conduct sets forth the ways in which these Core Values govern how our officers and employees conduct themselves and engage in business relationships. Our approach to sustainability involves integrating prudent environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) practices throughout the organization with a focus on transparency and building trust among stakeholders, managing operating and business risks and minimizing environmental impacts, and utilizing our people, assets and systems to maximize long-term value for our stakeholders. Annual environmental and safety performance targets help us measure progress toward meeting our sustainability objectives. Performance against such targets is also a factor in determining annual bonus compensation for our employees, which further incentivizes desired behaviors and outcomes. In addition, our Health, Safety, Environmental and Sustainability (“HSES”) Board Committee provides additional oversight and perspectives with respect to HSES matters. Additional information regarding our Core Values and our commitment to environmental and social responsibility, including our annual Sustainability Report, is available in the Sustainability section of our website. References to sustainability in this report incorporate ESG factors. See “—Available Information” below.
Description of Segments and Associated Assets
Under GAAP, we consolidate GP LLC, AAP and PAA and its subsidiaries. We currently have no separate operating activities apart from those conducted by PAA. As such, our segment analysis, presentation and discussion is the same as that of PAA, which conducts its operations through two segments — Crude Oil and NGL. Accordingly, any references to “we,” “us,” “our,” and similar terms describing assets, business characteristics or other related matters are references to assets, business characteristics or other matters involving PAA’s assets and operations. 
We have an extensive network of pipeline transportation, terminalling, storage and gathering assets in key crude oil and NGL producing basins and transportation corridors and at major market hubs in the United States and Canada.

Following is a description of the activities and assets for each of our segments.
Crude Oil Segment 
Crude Oil Market and Business Overview
Crude oil is a global commodity that serves as feedstock for many of the world’s essential refined products such as transportation fuels (gasoline, diesel, jet fuel) and heating oil, among others. While commodities are typically considered unspecialized, mass-produced and fungible, crude oil is neither unspecialized nor fungible. The crude slate available to North American and world-wide refineries consists of a substantial number of different grades and varieties. Each crude oil grade has distinguishing physical properties. For example, specific gravity (generally referred to as light or heavy), sulfur content (generally referred to as sweet or sour) and metals content, along with other characteristics, collectively result in varying economic attributes of a particular grade or type of crude oil. In many cases, these factors result in the need for such grades to be batched or segregated in the transportation and storage processes, blended to precise specifications or adjusted in value.
The lack of fungibility of the various grades of crude oil can create logistical transportation, terminalling and storage challenges and inefficiencies associated with regional volumetric supply and demand imbalances. These logistical inefficiencies are created as certain qualities of crude oil are indigenous to particular regions or countries. Also, each refinery has a distinct configuration of process units designed to handle particular grades of crude oil. The relative yields and the cost to obtain, transport and process the crude oil, combined with the value of finished goods created, drive a refinery’s choice of feedstock. 
11
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
Our business model integrates large-scale supply aggregation capabilities with the ownership and operation of critical infrastructure systems that connect major producing regions (supply) to key demand centers (refineries) and export terminals. Our assets and our business strategy are designed to serve our producer and refiner customers by addressing regional crude oil supply and demand imbalances that exist in the United States and Canada. The nature and extent of supply and demand imbalances change from time to time as a result of a variety of factors, including global demand for exports; regional production declines and/or increases; refinery expansions, modifications and shut-downs; available transportation and storage capacity; and government mandates and related regulatory factors.
Our Crude Oil segment operations generally consist of gathering and transporting crude oil using pipelines (including gathering systems), trucks and, at times, on barges or railcars, in addition to providing terminalling, storage and other related services utilizing our integrated assets across the United States and Canada. Our assets provide services to third parties as well as to our merchant activities. Our merchant activities include the purchase of crude oil supply and the movement of this supply on our assets or third-party assets to sales locations, including our terminals, third-party connecting carriers, regional hubs or to refineries.
The figure below provides an illustrative and simplified overview of the assets and activities associated with our Crude Oil segment (within the shaded area):
With respect to the transportation assets in this segment, we primarily generate revenue through a combination of tariffs, pipeline capacity agreements and other transportation fees. With respect to our crude oil terminal and condensate processing assets in this segment, we primarily generate revenue through a combination of month-to-month and multi-year agreements and arrangements which include storage, throughput and loading/unloading fees at our crude oil terminals and processing facilities. We also generate significant revenue through a variety of commercial and merchant activities that often result in increased utilization of our transportation and storage assets.
Crude Oil Segment Assets Overview
As of December 31, 2024, the assets utilized in our Crude Oil segment included the following:
•
18,800 miles of active crude oil transportation pipelines and gathering systems;
•
72 million barrels of commercial crude oil storage capacity at our terminalling and storage locations;
•
40 million barrels of active, above-ground tank capacity used to facilitate pipeline throughput or support our rail assets and help maintain product quality segregation;
•
four marine facilities in the United States; 
•
a condensate processing facility with an aggregate processing capacity of 120,000 barrels per day;
•
eight crude oil rail terminals with aggregate loading and unloading capacity of 264,000 and 380,000 barrels per day, respectively;
•
1,250 crude oil railcars; and

Includes total mileage of pipelines in which we own less than 100%.
(2)
Represents average daily volumes for the entire year attributable to our interest for pipelines owned by consolidated entities, unconsolidated entities or through undivided joint interests (“UJI”). Average daily volumes are calculated as the total volumes (attributable to our interest) for the year divided by the number of days in the year. Volumes reflect tariff movements and thus may be included multiple times as volumes move through our integrated system. Volumes associated with assets acquired or sold during the year represent total volumes for the number of days we actually owned the assets divided by the number of days in the period.
(3)
Commercial storage capacity in millions of barrels. Does not include operational storage capacity used to facilitate pipeline throughput and maintain product quality segregation.
(4)
All of our gathering pipelines and a majority of our intra-basin pipelines in the Permian Basin are owned by the Permian JV, a consolidated entity in which we own a 65% interest. The Permian JV has a 63% UJI in one of the intra-basin pipelines in the Permian Basin.
(5)
Includes pipelines operated by a third party.
Crude Oil Infrastructure
A significant portion of our crude oil assets are interconnected and are operated as a contiguous system. The following descriptions are organized by geographic location and asset type and represent our most significant assets. Pipeline capacities throughout these descriptions are based on our reasonable estimate of volumes that can be delivered from origin to final destination on our pipeline systems. We report pipeline volumes based on the tariffs charged for individual movements, some of which may only utilize a certain segment of a pipeline system (i.e. two short-haul movements on a pipeline from point A to 
13
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
point B and another from point B to point C would double the pipeline tariff volumes on a particular system versus a single point A to point C movement). As a result, at times, our reported tariff barrel movements may exceed our total capacity.
Our crude oil pipelines are comprised of:
•
gathering pipelines
 that move crude oil from wellhead or central battery connections to regional market hubs;
•
intra-basin pipelines
 that are used as a hub system allowing for a significant amount of flexibility by creating connections between regional hub locations; and

NGL Segment
NGL Market and Business Overview
NGL primarily includes ethane, propane, normal butane, iso-butane and natural gasoline, and is derived from natural gas production and processing activities, as well as crude oil refining processes. The individual NGL components are used for various purposes including heating, engine and industrial fuels, a component of motor gasoline and as the primary feedstock for petrochemical facilities that produce many everyday consumer products, including a wide range of plastics and synthetic rubber.
Our NGL segment operations involve natural gas processing and NGL fractionation, storage, transportation and terminalling. Our NGL revenues are primarily derived from a combination of (i) providing gathering, fractionation, storage, and/or terminalling services to third-party customers for a fee, and (ii) our merchant activities that support the assets.  Our merchant activities include the acquisition of extraction rights from producers and/or shippers of the gas streams that pass through our Empress facility. The extraction rights allow us to process that gas at our Empress facility and extract the higher valued NGL from the gas stream. We then purchase natural gas to replace the thermal content attributable to the NGL that was extracted. We use our assets to transport, store and fractionate NGL mix extracted from our Empress straddle plants, or NGL mix acquired from third parties, into finished products to sell to customers. We may also acquire finished NGL products to be seasonally stored in our storage caverns, which is then resold to third-party customers. Often times we will use derivative instruments to hedge the margins related to these merchant activities.
The figure below provides an illustrative and simplified overview of the assets and activities associated with our NGL segment (within the shaded area):

Natural Gas Processing and NGL Infrastructure
Our network of liquids infrastructure includes NGL fractionation facilities, underground NGL storage caverns, above ground storage tanks, NGL pipelines, and rail and truck terminals. With these assets, we process, fractionate, store and transport NGL such as ethane, propane, butane and condensate. The unique integrated and geographically diverse nature of our Canadian infrastructure provides the opportunity to maximize margins across the NGL value chain for both us and our customers. The most significant of these assets include the following:
Empress Facility
We own and operate four gas processing facilities near Empress, Alberta. These facilities, referred to as straddle plants because they “straddle” gas transportation pipelines, process natural gas to extract ethane and NGL mix entrained in the gas stream before returning the gas to the transportation pipelines. We acquire the rights to extract the NGL from producers and/or shippers of the gas streams that pass through our Empress facility and then purchase natural gas to replace the thermal content attributable to the NGL that was extracted. The NGL mix can be fractionated at our Empress facility or transported along the Enbridge pipeline system for fractionation at our Sarnia facility.
Our Empress plants are capable of processing up to 5.7 Bcf of natural gas per day; however, supply available to these plants is typically in the 3.5 to 4.5 Bcf per day range. These plants produce approximately 65,000 to 100,000 barrels per day of ethane, and 40,000 to 60,000 barrels per day of NGL mix. Our Empress fractionation facility is capable of processing and producing up to 26,000 barrels per day of NGL products and is connected to rail loading infrastructure at Empress and our PPTC pipeline system, which enables NGL to be transported to storage and loading terminals in Saskatchewan and Manitoba.
Co-Ed Pipeline
Our primary NGL transportation supply system, the Co-Ed NGL pipeline system, has transportation capacity of approximately 70,000 barrels per day and gathers NGL from Southwest and Central Alberta (Cardium, Deep Basin, and Alberta Montney) for delivery to our Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta NGL fractionation facilities.

Fort Saskatchewan Complex
Our Fort Saskatchewan facility is located near Edmonton, Alberta in one of the key North American NGL hubs. The facility is a receipt, storage, fractionation and delivery facility for NGL and is connected to other major NGL plants and pipeline systems in the area. The facility’s primary assets include a fractionation plant, 12 storage caverns, and truck and rail loading capability. Our Fort Saskatchewan fractionation facility has an inlet design capacity of 88,400 barrels per day and is able to produce up to approximately 44,500 barrels per day of propane, butane and condensate. The remaining throughput capacity is used to produce a propane and butane mix, which is transported via the Enbridge pipeline system to our Sarnia facility for further fractionation.
Sarnia Area
Our Sarnia Area assets in Southwestern Ontario consist of (i) our Sarnia facility, (ii) our Windsor storage terminal and (iii) our St. Clair, Michigan terminal. The Sarnia facility is a large NGL fractionation and storage facility with rail and truck loading capabilities. The Sarnia Area facilities are served by a network of multiple pipelines connected to various refineries, chemical plants, and other pipeline and railroad systems in the area. This pipeline network also delivers product between our Sarnia facility and our Windsor and St. Clair storage facilities. The Sarnia fractionator, which we operate and have a partial ownership interest in, receives NGL feedstock primarily from the Enbridge pipeline system and, to a lesser extent, from our rail unloading facility. The fractionation unit is able to process an average of approximately 100,000 barrels per day of NGL products. Our ownership in the various processing units at the Sarnia fractionator ranges from 61% to 85%.
Impact of Commodity Price Volatility and Dynamic Market Conditions on Our Business Model
Crude oil, NGL and natural gas commodity prices have historically been very volatile. For example, in 2024, the prompt month NYMEX light, sweet futures contract (commonly referred to as “WTI”) price ranged from a low of approximately $66 per barrel to a high of approximately $87 per barrel. Similarly, there has also been volatility within the propane and butane markets as seen through the North American benchmark price located at Mont Belvieu, Texas, as well as with the basis differentials between Mont Belvieu prices and prices realized at various market hubs in North America. 
While our objective is to position the Partnership such that our overall annual cash flow is not materially adversely affected by the absolute level of energy prices, market volatility associated with shifts between demand-driven markets and supply-driven markets or other similar dynamics may create market conditions that are more challenging to our business model. In extended periods of lower crude oil and/or NGL prices, or periods where the supply and demand fundamentals compress regional location differentials, our financial results may be adversely impacted. Under such market conditions, product flows on our pipelines or through our facilities may be adversely impacted. Alternatively, in periods where supply exceeds regional demand and/or pipeline egress, product flows on our pipelines or through our facilities may be favorably impacted. In executing our business model, we employ a variety of financial risk management tools and techniques to manage our financial risk, predominantly related to our merchant activities. These are discussed in greater detail in the “—Risk Management” section below.
In addition, relative contribution levels will vary from quarter-to-quarter due to seasonality, particularly with respect to our NGL merchant activities.

Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
Risk Management
To hedge margins involving our physical assets and manage risks associated with our various commodity purchase and sale obligations and, in certain circumstances, to realize incremental margin during volatile market conditions, we use derivative instruments. We also use various derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate risk and currency exchange rate risk. In analyzing our risk management activities, we draw a distinction between enterprise-level risks and trading-related risks. Enterprise-level risks are those that underlie our core businesses and may be managed based on management’s assessment of the cost or benefit of doing so. Conversely, trading-related risks (the risks involved in trading in the hopes of generating an increased return) are not inherent in our core business; rather, those risks arise as a result of engaging in trading activities. Our policy is to manage the enterprise-level risks inherent in our core businesses by using financial derivatives to protect our ability to generate cash flow and optimize asset profitability, rather than trying to profit from trading activities. Our commodity risk management policies and procedures are designed to monitor NYMEX, ICE and over-the-counter positions, as well as physical volumes, grades, locations, delivery schedules and storage capacity, to help ensure that our hedging activities address our risks. Our interest rate and currency exchange rate risk management policies and procedures are designed to monitor our derivative positions and ensure that those positions are consistent with our objectives and approved strategies. We have a risk management function that has direct responsibility and authority for our risk policies, related controls around commercial activities and procedures and certain other aspects of corporate risk management. Our risk management function also approves all new risk management strategies through a formal process. Our approved strategies are intended to mitigate and manage enterprise-level risks that are inherent in our core businesses.
Our policy is generally to structure our purchase and sales contracts so that price fluctuations do not materially affect our operating income, and not to acquire and hold physical inventory or derivatives for the purpose of speculating on outright commodity price changes. Although we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced within our merchant activities, we purchase crude oil, NGL and natural gas from thousands of locations and experience net unbalanced positions for short periods of time as a result of production, transportation and delivery variances as well as logistical issues associated with inclement weather conditions and other uncontrollable events that may occur. When unscheduled physical inventory builds or draws do occur, they are monitored and managed to a balanced position over a reasonable period of time. This activity is monitored independently by our risk management function and must take place within predefined limits and authorizations.
Credit
Our merchant activities in our Crude Oil and NGL segments require significant extensions of credit by our suppliers. To assure our ability to perform our obligations under purchase agreements, various credit arrangements are negotiated with our suppliers. These arrangements include open lines of credit and, to a lesser extent, standby letters of credit issued under our hedged inventory facility or our senior unsecured revolving credit facility. In addition, storing crude oil, NGL or spec products in a contango market, or otherwise, requires us to have credit facilities to finance both the purchase of these products in the prompt month as well as margin requirements that may be required for the derivative instruments used to hedge our price exposure.
When we sell crude oil and NGL, we must determine the amount, if any, of credit to be extended to any given customer. Because our typical sales transactions can involve large volumes of crude oil or NGL, the risk of nonpayment and nonperformance by customers is a major consideration in our business. We believe our sales are made to creditworthy entities or entities with adequate credit support. See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our credit review process and risk management procedures.
Customers 
ExxonMobil Corporation and its subsidiaries accounted for 30%, 26% and 20% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. BP p.l.c. and its subsidiaries accounted for 10% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023. No other customers accounted for 10% or more of our revenues during any of the three years ended December 31, 2024. The majority of revenues from these customers pertain to our Crude Oil segment merchant activities, and sales to these customers occur at multiple locations. If we were to lose one or more of these customers, there is risk that we would not be able to identify and access a replacement market at a comparable margin. For a discussion of credit and industry concentration risk, see Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Competition
Competition among pipelines is based primarily on transportation charges, access to producing areas and supply regions and demand for crude oil and NGL by end users. Although new pipeline projects represent a source of competition for our business, existing third-party owned pipelines with excess capacity in the vicinity of our operations also expose us to significant competition based on the relatively low operating cost associated with moving an incremental barrel of crude oil or NGL through such unutilized capacity. In areas where additional infrastructure is being built or has been built to accommodate new or increased production or changing product flows, we face competition in providing the required infrastructure solutions as well as the risk that capacity in the area will be overbuilt until production grows sufficiently or pipelines are retired or converted to alternate service. As a result of multiple pipeline expansions in the Permian Basin and other areas, together with meaningful changes and delays in expected production growth due to a variety of factors, we continue to experience heightened competition for uncommitted barrels and contract renewals, which puts downward pressure on tariffs and margins. Further slowing of production growth or production declines could exacerbate these risks, but we believe that the current duration of our contracts and structure of our integrated business model, combined with expected crude oil production growth in the Permian Basin and other areas, should partially mitigate these risks.
In addition, pipelines may also face competition from other forms of transportation, such as truck, rail and barge. Although these alternative forms of transportation typically cost more, they can provide access to alternative markets at which a higher price may be realized for the commodity being transported, thereby overcoming the increased transportation cost.
We also face competition with respect to our merchant activities and facilities services. Our competitors include other crude oil and NGL pipeline and terminalling companies, other NGL processing and fractionation companies, major integrated oil companies and their marketing affiliates, independent gatherers, private equity backed entities, banks that have established a trading platform, and brokers and marketers of widely varying sizes, financial resources and experience. Some of these competitors have capital resources greater than ours. In addition, relatively new pipelines supported by minimum volume commitments and/or acreage dedications could also amplify the level of competition for purchasing wellhead barrels, especially in the Permian Basin, and thus impact our margins.
Ongoing Activities Related to Strategic Transactions
We are continuously engaged in the evaluation of potential transactions that support our current business strategy. In the past, such transactions have included the acquisition of assets that complement our existing footprint, the sale of non-core assets, the sale of partial interests in assets to strategic joint venture partners, and large investment capital projects. With respect to a potential acquisition or divestiture, we may conduct an auction process or participate in an auction process conducted by a third party or we may negotiate a transaction with one or a limited number of potential sellers (in the case of an acquisition) or buyers (in the case of a divestiture). Such transactions could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
We typically do not announce a transaction until after we have executed a definitive agreement. In certain cases, in order to protect our business interests or for other reasons, we may defer public announcement of a transaction until closing or a later date. Past experience has demonstrated that discussions and negotiations regarding a potential transaction can advance or terminate in a short period of time. Moreover, the closing of any transaction for which we have entered into a definitive agreement may be subject to customary and other closing conditions, which may not ultimately be satisfied or waived. Accordingly, we can give no assurance that our current or future efforts with respect to any such transactions will be successful, and we can provide no assurance that our financial expectations with respect to such transactions will ultimately be realized. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks Related to PAA’s Business—Acquisitions and divestitures involve risks that may adversely affect PAA’s business

Joint Venture and Joint Ownership Arrangements 
We are party to more than 25 joint venture and UJI arrangements with long-term partners throughout the industry value chain spanning across multiple North American basins. We believe that these capital-efficient arrangements provide strategic alignment with long-term industry partners while adding volume commitments to our systems and improving returns.

Acquisitions and Divestitures
Since PAA’s initial public offering in 1998, the acquisition of midstream assets and businesses has been an important component of our business strategy. On a regular basis, we selectively analyze and pursue the acquisition of assets and businesses that are strategic and complementary to our existing operations. We also routinely review our asset portfolio to evaluate potential sales of non-core assets and/or sales of partial interests in assets to strategic joint venture partners to optimize our asset portfolio and strengthen our balance sheet and leverage metrics. For example, from 2016 through December 31, 2024, we have completed several acquisitions for an aggregate of approximately $3.0 billion (which figure excludes the value of our Permian JV formed in October 2021), and we have completed asset sales and sales of partial interests in assets to strategic joint venture partners totaling more than $4.9 billion. In addition, in the first quarter of 2025, PAA closed two additional acquisitions for approximately $580 million, net to our interest. See Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Capital Projects 
Our extensive asset base and our relationships with long-term industry partners across the value chain provide us with opportunities for organic growth through the construction of additional assets that are complementary to, and expand or extend, our existing asset base. Our 2025 capital plan consists of capital-efficient, highly contracted projects that help address industry needs. 
Total investment capital for the year ending December 31, 2025 is currently projected to be approximately $500 million ($400 million net to our interest), of which over half is expected to be associated with the Permian JV. Additionally, maintenance capital for 2025 is currently projected to be approximately $260 million ($240 million net to our interest). Note that potential variation to current capital cost estimates may result from (i) changes to project design, (ii) final cost of materials and labor and (iii) timing of incurrence of costs due to uncontrollable factors such as receipt of permits or regulatory approvals and weather.
Regulation
Our assets, operations and business activities are subject to extensive legal requirements and regulations under the jurisdiction of numerous federal, state, provincial and local agencies. Many of these agencies are authorized by statute to issue, and have issued, requirements binding on the energy industry, related businesses and individual participants. The failure to comply with such legal requirements and regulations can result in substantial fines and penalties, expose us to civil and criminal claims, and cause us to incur significant costs and expenses. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Laws and Regulations Impacting PAA’s Business—PAA’s operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment (people, property and natural resources), operational safety, climate change and related matters that may expose it to significant costs and liabilities. The current laws and regulations affecting PAA’s business are subject to change and in the future PAA may be subject to additional laws, executive orders and regulations, which could adversely impact PAA’s business.” At any given time, there may be proposals, provisional rulings or proceedings in legislation or under governmental agency or court review that could affect our business. The regulatory burden on our assets, operations and activities increases our cost of doing business and, consequently, affects our profitability. We can provide no assurance that the increased costs associated with any new or proposed laws, rules or regulations will not be material. We may at any time also be required to apply significant resources in responding to governmental requests for information and/or enforcement actions. 
The following is a summary of certain, but not all, of the laws and regulations affecting our operations. Unless the context requires otherwise, references herein to our “facilities” includes all of the pipelines, terminals, storage and other assets owned by us.
Health, Safety and Environmental Regulation
General
Our operations involving the storage, treatment, processing and transportation of liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons, including crude oil and NGL, are subject to stringent federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the environment and natural resources, operational safety and related matters. As with the industry generally, compliance with these laws and regulations increases our overall cost of doing business, including our capital costs to construct, maintain and upgrade equipment and facilities as regulations are updated or new regulations are invoked. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures, imposition of restrictions, delays or cancellations in the permitting or performance of projects, and the issuance of injunctions or other orders that may subject us to additional operational constraints or costs. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could also result in negative public perception of our operations or the industry in general, which may adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Environmental and safety laws and regulations are subject to changes that may result in more stringent requirements, and we cannot provide any assurance that compliance with current and future laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our results of operations or earnings. A discharge of hazardous liquids or other materials into the environment could, to the extent such event is not insured, subject us to substantial expense, including the cost to respond, repair and remediate any impact from releases, the cost to comply with applicable laws and regulations and liabilities or costs arising out of any claims made by third parties. The following is a summary of some of the environmental, health and safety laws and regulations to which our operations are subject.

Pipeline Safety/Integrity Management
A substantial portion of our petroleum pipelines and our storage tank facilities in the United States are subject to regulation by the Department of Transportation’s (“DOT”) Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) pursuant to the Hazardous Liquids Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, as amended (the “HLPSA”) with respect to crude oil and NGL. The HLPSA imposes safety requirements on the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of pipeline and tank facilities. Federal regulations implementing the HLPSA require pipeline operators to adopt measures designed to reduce the environmental impact of oil discharges from onshore oil pipelines, including the maintenance of comprehensive spill response plans and the performance of extensive spill response training for pipeline personnel. These regulations also require pipeline operators to develop and maintain a written qualification program for individuals performing covered tasks on pipeline facilities. Comparable regulation exists in some states in which we conduct intrastate common carrier or private pipeline operations. Our operations in Canada are also subject to comparable regulations promulgated by the Canada Energy Regulator (“CER”) and provincial regulators and agencies.
United States
Pursuant to the authority under the HLPSA, as amended from time to time, PHMSA has promulgated regulations that require transportation pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs, including frequent inspections, correction of certain identified anomalies and other measures, to ensure pipeline safety in locations where a pipeline leak or rupture could affect high risk areas known as high consequence areas (“HCAs”). The HCAs for crude oil and NGL pipelines are based on high population areas, areas unusually sensitive to environmental damage, and commercially navigable waterways. In the United States, our costs associated with the inspection, testing and correction of identified anomalies were approximately $40 million in 2024. Based on currently available information, our preliminary estimate for 2025 is that we will incur approximately $50 million in expenditures associated with our required pipeline integrity management program. However, significant additional expenses could be incurred if new or more stringently interpreted pipeline safety requirements are implemented. In addition to required activities, our integrity management program includes several voluntary, multi-year initiatives designed to prevent incidents. Costs incurred in connection with these voluntary initiatives were approximately $17 million in 2024, and our preliminary estimate for 2025 is that we will incur approximately $15 million of such costs.
U.S. federal legislation has resulted in more stringent mandates for pipeline safety and PHMSA has been charged with developing and adopting regulations that impose increased pipeline safety requirements on pipeline operators. In particular, Congress has amended the HLPSA several times over the past decade and to the extent those regulations impose practices that exceed our operating standards, they increase our cost to operate.
The DOT has issued guidelines with respect to securing regulated facilities against terrorist attack. We have instituted security measures and procedures in accordance with such guidelines to enhance the protection of certain of our facilities; however, we cannot provide any assurance that these security measures would fully protect our facilities from an attack.
The DOT has also generally adopted American Petroleum Institute Standard 653 (“API 653”) as the standard for the inspection, repair, alteration and reconstruction of above ground petroleum storage tanks subject to DOT jurisdiction. API 653 requires regularly scheduled inspection and repair of tanks remaining in service. In the United States, our costs associated with this program were $35 million in 2024. For 2025, we have budgeted approximately $45 million in connection with continued compliance activities with respect to API 653 and similar Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) regulations for tanks not regulated by the DOT. Certain storage tanks may be taken out of service if we believe the cost of compliance will exceed the value of the storage tanks and replacement tankage may be constructed.
Our operations are also subject to state pipeline safety and integrity regulations. For example, to protect state waters and wildlife, California has adopted legislation that requires operators of hazardous liquid pipelines located near environmentally and ecologically sensitive areas to use best available technologies to minimize the amount of oil released in an oil spill. These technologies include, but are not limited to, installation of leak detection technologies, automatic shutoff systems, or remote controlled sectionalized block valves.

Canada
In Canada, the CER and provincial regulators regulate the safety and integrity management of pipelines and facilities used for hydrocarbon transmission and storage. We have incurred and will continue to incur costs related to compliance with such regulatory requirements. For example, we continue to implement Pipeline, Facility and Cavern Integrity Management Programs in Canada to comply with applicable regulatory requirements and assist in our efforts to mitigate risk. Costs incurred for such integrity management activities were approximately $100 million in 2024. Our preliminary estimate for 2025 is approximately $85 million of costs on such projects.
We cannot predict the potential costs associated with additional, future regulations in Canada or the United States. Significant additional expenses could be incurred, and additional operational requirements and constraints could be imposed, if new or more stringently interpreted pipeline safety and integrity management requirements are implemented.
Occupational Safety and Health
United States
In the United States, we are subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) hazard communication standard and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act require that certain information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. Certain of our facilities are also subject to OSHA Process Safety Management (“PSM”) regulations, which are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals. These regulations apply to any process which involves a chemical at or above specified thresholds or any process that involves 10,000 pounds or more of a flammable liquid or gas in one location.
Canada
Similar regulatory requirements exist in Canada under the federal and provincial Occupational Health and Safety Acts, Regulations and Codes. The agencies with jurisdiction under these regulations are empowered to enforce them through inspection, audit, incident investigation or investigation of a public or employee complaint. In some jurisdictions, the agencies have been empowered to administer penalties for violations without the company first being prosecuted. Additionally, under the Criminal Code of Canada, organizations, corporations and individuals may be prosecuted criminally for violating the duty to protect employees and the public.
Solid Waste
We generate wastes, including hazardous wastes, that are subject to the requirements of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended (“RCRA”), and analogous state and provincial laws. Many of the wastes that we generate are not subject to the most stringent requirements of RCRA because our operations generate primarily oil and gas wastes, which currently are excluded from consideration as RCRA hazardous wastes. It is possible, however, that in the future, the exclusion for oil and gas waste under RCRA may be revisited and our wastes may become subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements, resulting in additional capital expenditures or operating expenses.
Hazardous Substances
The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended (“CERCLA”), also known as “Superfund,” and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original act, on certain classes of persons that contribute to the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed of, or arranged for the disposal of, the hazardous substances found at the site. Such persons may be subject to strict, joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment. In the course of our ordinary operations, we may generate waste that falls within CERCLA’s definition of a “hazardous substance.”
26
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
We are subject to the EPA’s Risk Management Plan regulations at certain facilities. These regulations are intended to work with OSHA’s PSM regulations to minimize the offsite consequences of catastrophic releases. The regulations require us to develop and implement a risk management program that includes a five-year accident history, an offsite consequence analysis process, a prevention program and an emergency response program.
Environmental Remediation
We currently own or lease, and in the past have owned or leased, properties where potentially hazardous liquids, including hydrocarbons, are or have been handled. These properties may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and state and Canadian federal and provincial laws and regulations. Under such laws and regulations, we could be required to remove or remediate potentially hazardous liquids or associated wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) and to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater).
Air Emissions
Our United States operations are subject to the United States Clean Air Act (“Clean Air Act” or “CAA”), comparable state laws and associated federal, state and local regulations. Our Canadian operations are also subject to federal and provincial air emission regulations, which are discussed in subsequent sections. 
As a result of the changing air emission requirements in both Canada and the United States, we may be required to incur certain capital and operating expenditures in the next several years to install air pollution control equipment and otherwise comply with more stringent federal, state, provincial and regional air emissions control requirements when we attempt to obtain or maintain permits and approvals for sources of air emissions. We can provide no assurance that future air compliance obligations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
Climate Change Initiatives
United States
The threat of climate change continues to attract considerable attention in the United States and around the world. Numerous proposals have been made and could continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (“GHG”). These efforts have included consideration of cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, climate-related disclosure obligations, climate-related mitigation funds, and regulations that directly limit GHG emissions from certain sources. Additionally, certain laws, like the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”), have been enacted to advance climate-related objectives and provide substantial financial support for alternative or lower GHG-emitting energy production. These proposals and related legislation and policy initiatives could increase operating costs within the oil and gas industry and accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels, which could in turn reduce demand for our products and services and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
In addition, following the U.S. Supreme Court (“SCOTUS”) finding that GHG emissions constitute a pollutant under the CAA, the EPA has adopted rules and regulations that, among other things, establish construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources, require the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and gas system sources, and impose performance standards for reducing methane emissions from oil and gas operations through limitations on venting and flaring and the implementation of enhanced emission leak detection and repair requirements. For 2024, one of our facilities was subject to the federal GHG reporting requirements for combustion GHG emissions and potential fugitive emissions above the reporting thresholds. We import sufficient quantities of finished fuel products into the United States to be required to report that activity as well. In recent years, there has been considerable uncertainty surrounding regulation of methane emissions. The EPA, under the Biden Administration, revisited federal regulations promulgated during the first Trump Administration regarding methane and promulgated final rules establishing new or more stringent standards for existing and new sources in the oil and gas sector, including the transmission and storage segments. The IRA also imposed a first-ever federal fee on excess methane emissions. Separately, the Bureau of Land Management has also finalized rules to limit venting, flaring, and methane leaks for oil and gas operations on federal lands. Whether or how the current Trump Administration or U.S. Congress may pursue changes to these regulations cannot be predicted at this time.
At the state level, California has implemented a GHG cap-and-trade program. California finished fuels providers, including Plains Marketing and Plains Midstream Canada, are required to purchase GHG emission credits for finished fuel sold in or imported into California.

Certain other states where we operate, such as Colorado, have also adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations related to GHG emissions. While it is not possible at this time to predict how federal or state governments may choose to regulate GHG emissions, any new regulatory restrictions on GHG emissions could result in material increased compliance costs, additional operating restrictions, an increase in the cost of feedstock and products produced by our refinery customers, and a reduced demand for petroleum-based fuels.
Canada
Large emitters of GHG have been required to report their emissions under the Canadian Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reporting Program since 2004. Effective January 1, 2018, the Federal Department of Environment and Climate Change lowered the reporting threshold for all facilities from 50 thousand tonnes per year (“kt/y”) to 10 kt/y GHG emissions. Four of our facilities are currently required to prepare annual emissions reports. The associated cost of complying with this reporting requirement is not considered to be material. Several Canadian Provinces, including some in which we operate, have implemented additional climate-related initiatives and regulations.
Water
The U.S. Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, also known as the Clean Water Act (“CWA”), and analogous state and Canadian federal and provincial laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters of the United States and Canada, as well as state and provincial waters. Federal, state and provincial regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA, and can also pursue injunctive relief to enforce compliance with the CWA and analogous laws.
The U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”) amended certain provisions of the CWA as they relate to the release of petroleum products into navigable waters. OPA subjects owners of facilities to strict, joint and potentially significant liability for containment and removal costs, natural resource damages and certain other consequences of an oil spill. State and Canadian federal and provincial laws also impose requirements relating to the prevention of oil releases and the remediation of impacted areas. 
The construction or expansion of pipelines often requires authorizations under the CWA, which authorizations may be subject to challenge. For over 35 years, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the “Corps”) has authorized construction, maintenance and repair of pipelines under a streamlined nationwide permit program known as Nationwide Permit 12 (“NWP 12”). From time to time, environmental groups have challenged the use of NWP 12 for oil and gas pipeline projects. Due to these types of challenges along with new directives that come along with administrative changes, the Corps will review and make updates to their programs as well.
In January 2021, the Corps published a reissuance of NWP 12, but this permit is being challenged in federal court on the same grounds that were litigated in an April 2020 case surrounding a failure to conduct Endangered Species Act consultations. In May 2022, the Corps announced it was beginning a formal review of NWP 12 and may make changes to the program. While the full extent and impact of these recent developments is unclear at this time, any disruption in our ability to obtain coverage under NWP 12 or other general permits may result in increased costs and project delays if we are forced to seek individual permits from the Corps.

Also, there continues to be uncertainty on the federal government’s applicable jurisdictional reach under the CWA over waters of the United States (“WOTUS”), including wetlands. The EPA and the Corps have pursued multiple rulemakings under the Obama, Trump, and Biden Administrations in attempts to determine the scope of such reach. Following legal actions, implementation of the most recent rule is currently split across the country. The rule is subject to an injunction in 27 states resulting in implementation of the pre-2015 rule adjusted to take in into account jurisdictional limitations decided by SCOTUS in 
Sackett v. EPA
. The other 23 states are subject to a WOTUS-defining rule published in September 2023. Further, the current Trump Administration may pursue a new rulemaking to further revise or clarify the extent of federal jurisdiction under the CWA, though the substance and timing of such action cannot be predicted. In addition, on January 8, 2025, the Corps published revisions to their Ordinary High Water Mark Manual, a key technical document used by the Corps to make jurisdictional determinations. At this time, it is difficult to judge how impactful these revisions will be. In an April 2020 decision, 
Maui v. Hawaii Wildlife Fund
, SCOTUS held that, in certain cases, discharges from a point source to groundwater could fall within the scope of the CWA and require a permit. The Court rejected the EPA’s and Corps’ assertion that groundwater should be totally excluded from the CWA. In response to SCOTUS’ decision, EPA published a draft 
Maui
 Guidance on November 27, 2023 which was intended to clarify when certain discharges to groundwater may require a CWA permit. Preliminarily, it appears that this draft guidance requires additional clarity and considerations to better understand permitting requirements specific to groundwater discharges. To date, the guidance has not been finalized and whether or how the current Trump Administration will pursue revisions to the guidance is uncertain. To the extent any new rule or judicial decision expands the scope of the CWA’s jurisdiction in areas where we or our customers conduct operations, such developments could delay, restrict or halt permitting or development of projects, result in longer permitting timelines, or increased compliance expenditures or mitigation costs for our and our customers’ operations, which may reduce the rate of production from operators.
Endangered Species
The federal Endangered Species Act (the “ESA”) and comparable state laws may restrict exploration, development and production activities that may affect endangered and threatened species or their habitats. The ESA provides broad protection for species of fish, wildlife and plants that are listed as threatened or endangered in the United States and prohibits the taking of protected species. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, Canada’s Species at Risk Act, and other analogous state and provincial laws and regulations. Under the ESA, federal agencies are required to ensure that any action authorized, funded or carried out by them is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed or endangered species or modify their critical habitats. New projects may require approvals and environmental analysis under these and other laws, including the National Environmental Policy Act. The resulting costs and liabilities associated with lengthy regulatory review and approval requirements could materially and negatively affect the viability of such projects.
Other Regulations
Transportation Regulation
Our transportation activities are subject to regulation by multiple governmental agencies. Our historical operating costs reflect the recurring costs resulting from compliance with these regulations. The following is a summary of the types of transportation regulation that may impact our operations.
Interstate Liquids Regulation in the United States.
  Our common carrier pipeline operations with interstate movements of liquids are subject to rate regulation by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) under the Interstate Commerce Act (“ICA”). Unless covered by a waiver, the ICA requires that we maintain tariffs on file with FERC for interstate movements of liquids on our pipelines. Those tariffs set forth the rates we charge for providing transportation services as well as the rules and regulations governing these services. The ICA requires that tariff rates for liquids pipelines, which include both crude oil pipelines and petroleum products pipelines, be just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory. Failure to comply with the requirements of the ICA could result in the imposition of civil or criminal penalties, as described below.
29
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
Under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (“EPAct”), liquids pipeline rates in effect for the 365-day period ending on the date of enactment of EPAct are deemed to be just and reasonable under the ICA if such rates had not been subject to complaint, protest or investigation during such 365-day period. Generally, complaints against such “grandfathered” rates may only be pursued if the complainant can show that a substantial change has occurred since the enactment of EPAct in either the economic circumstances of the liquids pipeline or in the nature of the services provided that were a basis for the rate. EPAct places no such limit on challenges to a provision of a liquids pipeline tariff rate or rules as unduly discriminatory or preferential. Many FERC-regulated liquids pipelines also use the FERC indexing methodology to change their rates. For those pipelines that use the FERC indexing methodology, FERC reviews the index formula every five years to determine whether a change in the methodology is required or, if not, to determine the appropriate index for the subsequent five-year period. On January 20, 2022, FERC issued an order on rehearing of its December 17, 2020 Order Establishing Index Level in which FERC reduced the oil pricing index factor for oil pipelines to use for the current five-year period. The ceiling levels computed for July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023, as well as the ceiling levels for July 1, 2023 to June 30, 2024, and the resulting rates currently in effect for certain of our liquids pipelines, were computed to account for the appropriate index factor. Some parties sought rehearing of the January 20 order on rehearing, which was denied by FERC on May 6, 2022. Certain parties subsequently appealed the January 20 and May 6 orders to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (“D.C. Circuit”). On July 26, 2024, the D.C. Circuit 
ruled in 
LEPA v. FERC
 that FERC violated the Administrative Procedure Act because the January 20 order modified the index level without following notice and comment. As a result, the D.C. Circuit vacated the January 20 order and on September 17, 2024, the Commission reinstated the index level established by its original December 17 Order Establishing Index Level, directed pipelines to file an informational filing to show their recomputed ceiling levels reflecting the reinstated index level, and stated that pipelines may file to prospectively increase their indexed rates to their recomputed levels. On October 17, 2024, FERC issued a Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“Supplemental NOPR”) that proposes a reduction to the currently effective index by one percent. The Supplemental NOPR could result in the reimplementation through a notice-and-comment rulemaking of the same rulings that were vacated by the D.C. Circuit in 
LEPA v. FERC
. 
FERC has also retained cost-of-service ratemaking, market-based rates and settlement rates as alternatives to the indexing approach that may be used in certain specified circumstances.
Because the indexing methodology for the next five-year indexing period is tied in part to an inflation index and is not based on our specific costs, the indexing methodology could hamper our ability to recover cost increases. The majority of our pipeline profits in the United States are based on rates that are either grandfathered in part or set by agreement with one or more shippers. These rates remain regulated by FERC and are subject to challenge or review and modification by FERC under the ICA. Changes in FERC’s methodologies for approving rates could adversely affect us. In addition, challenges to our regulated rates could be filed with FERC and future decisions by FERC regarding our regulated rates could adversely affect our cash flows.
The Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorized FERC to impose civil penalties for violations of the ICA and FERC regulations thereunder, up to a maximum amount that is adjusted annually for inflation, which for 2025 equals $16,590 per day, per violation. Should we fail to comply with applicable statutes, rules, regulations and orders administered by FERC, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines.
Intrastate Regulation in the United States.
  Our intrastate liquids pipeline transportation activities are subject to various state laws and regulations, as well as orders of state regulatory bodies, including the Railroad Commission of Texas and the California Public Utility Commission (“CPUC”). The CPUC prohibits certain of our subsidiaries from acting as guarantors of our senior notes and credit facilities.
Canadian Regulation.
  Our Canadian pipeline assets are subject to regulation by the CER and by provincial regulators. With respect to pipelines over which it has jurisdiction, the relevant regulatory authority has the power, upon application by a third party, to determine reasonability of the rates we are allowed to charge for transportation on, and set other terms of access to, such pipelines. In such circumstances, if the relevant regulatory authority determines that the applicable terms and conditions of service are not just and reasonable, the regulatory authority can impose conditions it considers appropriate.

Trucking Regulation
United States
We operate a fleet of trucks to transport crude oil and oilfield materials as a private, contract and common carrier. We are licensed to perform both intrastate and interstate motor carrier services. As a motor carrier, we are subject to certain safety regulations issued by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Association of the DOT. These trucking regulations cover, among other things: (i) driver operations, (ii) log book maintenance, (iii) truck manifest preparations, (iv) safety placard placement on the trucks and trailer vehicles, (v) drug and alcohol testing and (vi) operation and equipment safety. We are also subject to OSHA with respect to our U.S. trucking operations.
Canada
Our trucking assets in Canada are subject to regulation by both federal and provincial transportation agencies in the provinces in which they are operated. These regulatory agencies do not set freight rates, but do establish and administer rules and regulations relating to other matters including equipment, facility inspection, reporting and safety. We are licensed to operate both intra- and inter-provincially under the direction of the National Safety Code (“NSC”) that is administered by Transport Canada. Our for-hire service is primarily the transportation of crude oil, condensates and NGL. We are required under the NSC to, among other things, monitor (i) driver operations, (ii) log book maintenance, (iii) truck manifest preparations, (iv) safety placard placement on the trucks and trailers, (v) operation and equipment safety and (vi) many other aspects of trucking operations. We are also subject to Occupational Health and Safety regulations with respect to our Canadian trucking operations.
Railcar Regulation
We own and operate a number of railcar loading and unloading facilities in the United States and Canada. In connection with these operations, we own and lease a significant number of railcars. Our railcar operations are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Federal Railroad Administration of the DOT, OSHA, as well as other federal and state regulatory agencies and Canadian regulatory agencies for operations in Canada. From time to time, these regulatory bodies may enact new regulations or revise and update existing regulations related to the transportation of oil and NGL by railcar. For example, PHMSA has issued safety advisory warnings and compliance initiatives to reinforce requirements to properly test, characterize, classify, describe, label and, where appropriate, sufficiently degasify hazardous materials prior to and during transportation. We believe our railcar fleet is in compliance in all material respects with current standards for crude oil moved by rail.
Indigenous Protections
Part of our operations cross land that has historically been apportioned to various Native American/First Nations tribes (“Indigenous Peoples”), who may exercise significant jurisdiction and sovereignty over their lands. Indigenous Peoples may also have certain treaty rights and rights to consultation on projects that may affect such lands. Our operations may be impacted to the extent these tribal governments are found to have and choose to act upon such jurisdiction over lands where we operate. 
Transportation Security Administration Security Directives
In response to cybersecurity incidents affecting the pipeline industry, the United States Department of Homeland Security’s Transportation Security Administration has issued comprehensive security directives that include various cybersecurity and reporting requirements for critical infrastructure pipeline owners and/or operators. Compliance with these security directives may have a significant impact on our operations and results of operations.
Cross Border Regulation
As a result of our cross border activities, including the transportation and importation of crude oil and NGL between the United States and Canada, we are subject to a variety of legal requirements including export license requirements, trade tariffs, Canadian and U.S. customs and taxes, and requirements relating to toxic substances. U.S. legal requirements relating to these activities include the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (“USMCA”) and the Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”), as well as presidential permit requirements of the U.S. Department of State. Violations of these licensing, trade tariff and tax reporting requirements or failure to provide certifications relating to toxic substances could result in the imposition of significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Furthermore, the failure to comply with U.S. federal, state and local tax requirements, as well as Canadian federal and provincial tax requirements, could lead to the imposition of additional taxes, interest and penalties.

The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) has issued regulations pursuant to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 intended to prohibit market manipulation in the petroleum industry. Violators of the regulations face civil penalties of up to approximately $1.5 million per violation per day, subject to the FTC’s annual inflation adjustment. The Dodd-Frank Act incorporates an expansion of the authority of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) to prohibit market manipulation in the markets regulated by the CFTC. This authority, with respect to crude oil swaps and futures contracts, is similar to the anti-manipulation authority granted to the FTC with respect to crude oil purchases and sales. CFTC rules subject violators to a civil penalty of up to the greater of approximately $1.49 million, subject to the CFTC’s annual inflation adjustment, or triple the monetary gain to the person for each violation.
Operational Hazards and Insurance
Pipelines, terminals, trucks or other facilities or equipment may experience damage as a result of an accident, natural disaster, terrorist attack, cyber event or other event. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operations. Consistent with insurance coverage generally available in the industry, in certain circumstances our insurance policies provide limited coverage for losses or liabilities relating to gradual pollution, with broader coverage for sudden and accidental occurrences. We maintain various types and varying levels of insurance coverage to cover our operations and properties, and we self-insure certain risks, including gradual pollution, cybersecurity and named windstorms. To the extent we do maintain insurance coverage, such insurance does not cover every potential risk that might occur in connection with operating pipelines, terminals and other facilities and equipment, including the potential loss of significant revenues and cash flows.  
The occurrence of a significant event not fully insured, indemnified or reserved against, or the failure of a party to meet its insurance or indemnification obligations, could materially and adversely affect our operations and financial condition. While we strive to maintain adequate insurance coverage, our actual costs may exceed our coverage levels and insurance will not cover many types of interruptions or losses that might occur, will not cover amounts up to applicable deductibles and will not cover all risks associated with certain of our assets and operations. With respect to our insurance coverage, our policies are subject to deductibles and retention levels that we consider reasonable and not excessive. Additionally, no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable or that the insurance companies that currently insure companies in the energy industry will continue to do so. As a result, we may elect to self-insure or utilize higher deductibles in certain other insurance programs. In addition, although we believe that we have established adequate reserves and that we have sufficient liquidity to the extent such risks are not insured, costs incurred in excess of these reserves may be higher or we may not receive insurance proceeds in a timely manner, which may potentially have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. See Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion regarding the Line 901 incident and our related insurance receivable.
Title to Properties and Rights-of-Way
Our real property holdings generally consist of: (i) parcels of land that we own in fee; (ii) surface leases and underground storage leases; and (iii) easements, rights-of-way, permits, crossing agreements or licenses from landowners or governmental authorities permitting the use of certain lands for our operations. In all material respects, we believe we have satisfactory title or the right to use the sites upon which our significant facilities are located, subject to (a) customary liens, restrictions or encumbrances and (b) challenges that we do not regard as material relative to our overall operations. Some of our real property rights may be subject to termination under agreements that provide for one or more of: periodic payments, term periods, renewal rights, abandonment of use, continuous operation requirements, revocation by the licensor or grantor and possible relocation obligations.
Human Capital
General
Our primary human capital management objective is to retain, attract and develop a high quality workforce that will enable us to maintain and enhance a culture that is consistent with our Core Values. To support this objective, we seek to reward and support our employees through competitive pay, benefits and other programs; develop employees and encourage internal talent mobility to prepare employees for critical roles and leadership positions for the future; facilitate the development of a workplace culture that is engaging and inclusive; and promote efficiency and a high performance culture by investing in technology and systems and providing tools and resources that enable employees at work.

Neither we nor our general partner have officers or employees. All of our officers and other personnel necessary for our business to function are employed by GP LLC or PMC ULC. As of December 31, 2024, GP LLC and PMC ULC employed approximately 4,200 people in North America, of which approximately 3,000 were employed in the U.S. and approximately 1,200 were employed in Canada. Approximately 69% of our workforce (approximately 2,900 employees) are field employees, which includes approximately 800 employees in our trucking division. Our employees are located in 24 states in the U.S. and in four provinces in Canada. Approximately 200 employees are covered by six separate collective bargaining agreements, which are open for renegotiation in 2025 through 2027.
Health and Safety 
Our people are our most valuable asset. We prioritize the health and safety of our employees and we are committed to protecting our employees and conducting our operations in a safe, reliable and responsible manner. We support our commitment to health and safety through extensive education and training and investment in necessary equipment, systems, processes and other resources, and we have a number of safety programs and campaigns that are shared across our operations, such as “Hazard ID / Near Miss Program” communications, periodic and situation specific safety stand-downs, lessons learned sharing and stop work authorization for all employees. We also have a number of programs that are focused on employee wellness, including an employee assistance program that provides free mental and behavioral support for employees. In addition, in order to incentivize performance in the areas of safety and environmental responsibility, our performance-based annual bonus program includes a component that is tied to safety and environmental performance targets. In addition, the HSES Committee assists the Board in its evaluation and oversight of our management of HSES matters. Through the discharge of its oversight responsibilities, the HSES Committee facilitates the efforts of management to further strengthen our focus on Sustainability matters.
Training and Leadership Development 
We are committed to providing a professional work environment where all employees are treated with respect and dignity and provided with opportunities for growth and development. To foster the continued development of our people, we provide a comprehensive set of training programs covering subjects such as field operations, health and safety, regulatory compliance, technical training, management and leadership skills, and professional development. We also operate a number of internal development programs at all levels of the workforce that are designed to identify and develop future leaders of the organization. The Board receives reports from senior management on a regular basis regarding the status of succession plans with respect to executive leadership of the company. 
Benefits
Our compensation and benefits programs are designed to retain, attract and motivate our employees and to reward them for their contributions and success. In addition to providing competitive salaries and other compensation opportunities, we offer comprehensive and competitive benefits to our eligible employees including, depending on location, health (medical, dental and vision) insurance, prescription drug benefits, flexible spending accounts, parental leave, disability coverage, mental and behavioral health resources, paid time off, retirement savings plan, education reimbursement program, a disaster relief fund, life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment insurance. 
Summary of Tax Considerations 
The following is a brief summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences and tax considerations related to the purchase, ownership and disposition of our Class A shares by a taxpayer that holds our Class A shares as a “capital asset” (generally property held for investment). This summary is based on the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative rulings and judicial decisions, all as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. We have not sought any ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will agree with such statements and conclusions.

This summary does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation or the tax considerations arising under the laws of any non-U.S., state, or local jurisdiction, or under U.S. federal estate and gift tax laws. In addition, this summary does not address tax considerations applicable to investors that may be subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws. The tax consequences of ownership of Class A shares depends in part on the owner’s individual tax circumstances. It is the responsibility of each shareholder, either individually or through a tax advisor, to investigate the legal and tax consequences of the shareholder’s investment in us under applicable U.S. federal, state and local law, as well as the law applicable in Canada and the Canadian provinces. Further, it is the responsibility of each shareholder to file all U.S. federal, Canadian, state, provincial and local tax returns that may be required of the shareholder.  Also see Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Tax Risks.”
Corporate Status
Although we are a Delaware limited partnership, we have elected to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, we are subject to tax as a corporation and distributions on our Class A shares will be treated as distributions on corporate stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes. No Schedule K-1 will be issued with respect to our Class A shares. Instead, holders of Class A shares will receive a Form 1099 from us or a broker with respect to distributions received on our Class A shares.
Consequences to U.S. Holders
The discussion in this section is addressed to holders of our Class A shares who are U.S. holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For the purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of our Class A shares that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is:
•
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
•
a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
•
an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or
•
a trust (i) the administration of which is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and which has one or more United States persons who have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) which has made a valid election under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person.
Distributions
Distributions with respect to our Class A shares will constitute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent paid from our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. To the extent that the amount of a distribution with respect to our Class A shares exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits, such distribution will be treated first as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such Class A shares, which reduces such basis dollar-for-dollar, and thereafter as capital gain from the sale or exchange of such Class A shares. See “
—
Gain on Disposition of Class A Shares.” Non-corporate holders that receive distributions on our Class A shares that are treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a reduced rate (currently at a maximum rate of 20%) provided certain holding period requirements are met.
Both AAP and PAA have made elections permitted by Section 754 of the Code. As a result, our acquisition of AAP units in connection with our initial public offering (“IPO”) and in connection with exchanges since the IPO by the holders of our Class B shares and the AAP units not held by us (“Legacy Owners”) and their permitted transferees of their AAP units and Class B shares for Class A shares have resulted in basis adjustments with respect to our interest in the assets of AAP (and indirectly in PAA). Such adjustments have resulted in depreciation and amortization deductions that we anticipate will offset a substantial portion of our taxable income for an extended period of time. In addition, future exchanges of AAP units and Class B shares for our Class A shares will result in additional basis adjustments with respect to our interest in the assets of AAP (and indirectly in PAA). We expect to benefit from additional tax deductions resulting from those adjustments, the amount of which will vary depending on the value of the Class A shares at the time of the exchange.

As a result of the basis adjustments described above, we may not have sufficient earnings and profits for distributions on our Class A shares to qualify as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If a distribution on our Class A shares fails to qualify as a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such distribution will be treated first as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in our Class A shares and thereafter as capital gain from the sale or exchange of our Class A shares. As a result, U.S. corporate holders will be unable to utilize the corporate dividends-received deduction with respect to such distribution.
Investors in our Class A shares are encouraged to consult their tax advisors as to the tax consequences of receiving distributions on our Class A shares that do not qualify as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes, including, in the case of corporate investors, the inability to claim the corporate dividends received deduction with respect to such distributions.
Gain on Disposition of Class A Shares
A U.S. holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss on a sale, exchange, certain redemptions, or other taxable disposition of our Class A shares equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized upon the disposition of such Class A shares and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in those shares. A U.S. holder’s tax basis in our shares generally will be equal to the amount paid for such shares reduced (but not below zero) by distributions received on such shares that are not treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such capital gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder’s holding period for the shares sold or disposed of is more than one year. Long-term capital gains of individuals generally are subject to U.S. federal income tax at a reduced rate (currently at a maximum rate of 20%). The deductibility of net capital losses is subject to limitations.
Backup Withholding and Information Reporting
Information returns generally will be filed with the IRS with respect to distributions on our Class A shares and the proceeds from a disposition of our Class A shares. U.S. holders may be subject to backup withholding on distributions with respect to our Class A shares and on the proceeds of a disposition of our Class A shares unless such U.S. holders furnish the applicable withholding agent with a taxpayer identification number, certified under penalties of perjury, and certain other information, or otherwise establish, in the manner prescribed by law, an exemption from backup withholding. Penalties apply for failure to furnish correct information and for failure to include reportable payments in income.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be creditable against a U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, and the U.S. holder may be entitled to a refund, provided the U.S. holder timely furnishes the required information to the IRS. U.S. holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of the backup withholding rules to their particular circumstances and the availability of, and procedure for, obtaining an exemption from backup withholding.
Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders
The discussion in this section is addressed to holders of our Class A shares who are non-U.S. holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For purposes of this discussion, a “non-U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of our Class A shares that is an individual, corporation, estate or trust that is not a U.S. holder as defined above.

Distributions
Distributions with respect to our Class A shares will constitute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent paid from our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. To the extent those distributions exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits, the distributions will be treated as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of the non-U.S. holder’s tax basis in our common stock and thereafter as capital gain from the sale or exchange of such common stock. See “—Gain on Disposition of Class A Shares.” Subject to the withholding requirements under FATCA (as defined below) and with respect to effectively connected dividends, each of which is discussed below, any distribution made to a non-U.S. holder on our Class A shares generally will be subject to U.S. withholding tax at a rate of 30% of the gross amount of the distribution unless an applicable income tax treaty provides for a lower rate. To the extent a distribution exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits, such distribution will reduce the non-U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in its Class A shares (but not below zero). The amount of any such distribution in excess of the non-U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in its Class A shares will be treated as gain from the sale of such shares and will have the tax consequences described below under “Gain on Disposition of Class A Shares.” The rules applicable to distributions by a United States real property holding corporation (a “USRPHC”) to non-U.S. persons that exceed current and accumulated earnings and profits are not clear. As a result, it is possible that U.S. federal income tax at a rate not less than 15% (or such lower rate as specified by an applicable income tax treaty for distributions from a USRPHC) may be withheld from distributions received by non-U.S. holders that exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits. To receive the benefit of a reduced treaty rate, a non-U.S. holder must provide the applicable withholding agent with an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or other applicable or successor form) certifying qualification for the reduced rate.
Non-U.S. holders are encouraged to consult their tax advisors regarding the withholding rules applicable to distributions on our Class A shares, the requirement for claiming treaty benefits, and any procedures required to obtain a refund of any overwithheld amounts.
Distributions treated as dividends that are paid to a non-U.S. holder and that are effectively connected with a trade or business conducted by the non-U.S. holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, are treated as attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the non-U.S. holder in the United States) generally will be taxed on a net income basis at the rates and in the manner generally applicable to United States persons (as defined under the Code). Such effectively connected dividends will not be subject to U.S. withholding tax if the non-U.S. holder satisfies certain certification requirements by providing the applicable withholding agent with a properly executed IRS Form W-8ECI certifying eligibility for exemption. If the non-U.S. holder is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it may also be subject to a branch profits tax (at a 30% rate or such lower rate as specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on its effectively connected earnings and profits (as adjusted for certain items), which will include effectively connected dividends.
Gain on Disposition of Class A Shares
Subject to the discussion below under “
—
Backup Withholding and Information Reporting,” a non-U.S. holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax on any gain realized upon the sale or other disposition of our Class A shares unless:
•
the non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the United States for a period or periods aggregating 183 days or more during the calendar year in which the sale or disposition occurs and certain other conditions are met;
•
the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business conducted by the non-U.S. holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the non-U.S. holder in the United States); or
•
our Class A shares constitute a United States real property interest by reason of our status as a USRPHC for U.S. federal income tax purposes and as a result such gain is treated as effectively connected with a trade or business conducted by the non-U.S. holder in the United States.
A non-U.S. holder described in the first bullet point above will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on the amount of such gain, which generally may be offset by U.S. source capital losses provided the non-U.S. holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses.
36
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
A non-U.S. holder whose gain is described in the second bullet point above or, subject to the exceptions described in the next paragraph, the third bullet point above, generally will be taxed on a net income basis at the rates and in the manner generally applicable to United States persons (as defined under the Code) unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise. If the non-U.S. holder is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes whose gain is described in the second bullet point above, then such gain would also be included in its effectively connected earnings and profits (as adjusted for certain items), which may be subject to a branch profits tax (at a 30% rate or such lower rate as specified by an applicable income tax treaty).
Generally, a corporation is a USRPHC if the fair market value of its United States real property interests equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of the fair market value of its worldwide real property interests and its other assets used or held for use in a trade or business. We believe that we currently are, and expect to remain for the foreseeable future, a USRPHC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, as long as our Class A shares continue to be “regularly traded on an established securities market” (within the meaning of the U.S. Treasury regulations), only a non-U.S. holder that actually or constructively owns, or owned at any time during the shorter of the five-year period ending on the date of the disposition or the non-U.S. holder’s holding period for the Class A shares, more than 5% of our Class A shares will be treated as disposing of a United States real property interest and will be taxable on gain realized on the disposition of our Class A shares as a result of our status as a USRPHC. If our Class A shares were not considered to be regularly traded on an established securities market, such non-U.S. holder (regardless of the percentage of our Class A shares owned) would be treated as disposing of a United States real property interest and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a taxable disposition of our Class A shares (as described in the preceding paragraph), and a 15% withholding tax would apply to the gross proceeds from such disposition.
Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors with respect to the application of the foregoing rules to their ownership and disposition of our Class A shares, including regarding potentially applicable income tax treaties that may provide for different rules.
Backup Withholding and Information Reporting
Any distributions paid to a non-U.S. holder must be reported annually to the IRS and to each non-U.S. holder. Copies of these information returns may be made available to the tax authorities in the country in which the non-U.S. holder resides or is established. Payments of distributions to a non-U.S. holder generally will not be subject to backup withholding if the non-U.S. holder establishes an exemption by properly certifying its non-U.S. status on an IRS Form W-8BEN, or IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or other applicable or successor form).
Payments of the proceeds from a sale or other disposition by a non-U.S. holder of our Class A shares effected by or through a U.S. office of a broker generally will be subject to information reporting and backup withholding (at the applicable rate) unless the non-U.S. holder establishes an exemption by properly certifying its non-U.S. status on an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or other applicable or successor form) and certain other conditions are met. Information reporting and backup withholding generally will not apply to any payment of the proceeds from a sale or other disposition of our Class A shares effected outside the United States by a non-U.S. office of a broker. However, unless such broker has documentary evidence in its records that the non-U.S. holder is not a United States person and certain other conditions are met, or the non-U.S. holder otherwise establishes an exemption, information reporting will apply to a payment of the proceeds of the disposition of our Class A shares effected outside the United States by such a broker if it has certain relationships within the United States.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, the U.S. federal income tax liability (if any) of persons subject to backup withholding will be reduced by the amount of tax withheld. If backup withholding results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund may be obtained, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

Additional Withholding Requirements under FATCA
Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, and the U.S. Treasury regulations and administrative guidance issued thereunder (“FATCA”), impose a 30% withholding tax on any dividends paid on our Class A shares and, subject to the proposed U.S. Treasury regulations discussed below, on proceeds from sales or other dispositions of our Class A shares if paid to a “foreign financial institution” or a “non-financial foreign entity” (each as defined in the Code) (including, in some cases, when such foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity is acting as an intermediary), unless (i) in the case of a foreign financial institution, such institution enters into an agreement with the U.S. government to withhold on certain payments, and to collect and provide to the U.S. tax authorities substantial information regarding U.S. account holders of such institution (which includes certain equity and debt holders of such institution, as well as certain account holders that are non-U.S. entities with U.S. owners), (ii) in the case of a non-financial foreign entity, such entity certifies that it does not have any “substantial United States owners” (as defined in the Code) or provides the applicable withholding agent with a certification identifying the direct and indirect substantial United States owners of the entity (in either case, generally on an IRS Form W-8BEN-E), or (iii) the foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity otherwise qualifies for an exemption from these rules and provides appropriate documentation (such as an IRS Form W-8BEN-E). Foreign financial institutions located in jurisdictions that have an intergovernmental agreement with the United States governing these rules may be subject to different rules. Under certain circumstances, a holder might be eligible for refunds or credits of such taxes. While gross proceeds from a sale or other disposition of our Class A shares paid after January 1, 2019 would have originally been subject to withholding under FATCA, proposed U.S. Treasury regulations provide that such payments of gross proceeds do not constitute withholdable payments. Taxpayers may generally rely on these proposed U.S. Treasury regulations until they are revoked or final U.S. Treasury regulations are issued. Non-U.S. holders are encouraged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the effects of FATCA on an investment in our Class A shares.
