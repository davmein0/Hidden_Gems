Cash Distribution Policy
Our partnership agreement requires that, within 55 days following the end of each quarter, we distribute all of our available cash to Class A shareholders of record on the applicable record date. Available cash generally means, for any quarter ending prior to liquidation, all cash and cash equivalents on hand on the date of determination of available cash for the distribution in respect of such quarter (including expected distributions from AAP in respect of such quarter), less the amount of cash reserves established by our general partner to:
•
comply with applicable law or any agreement binding upon us or our subsidiaries (exclusive of PAA and its subsidiaries);
•
provide funds for future distributions to shareholders;
•
provide for future capital expenditures, debt service and other credit needs as well as any federal, state, provincial or other income tax that may affect us in the future; 
•
provide for our general, administrative or other expenses; or
•
provide for the proper conduct of our business.
Our principal source of cash flow is derived from our indirect investment in PAA. As of December 31, 2024, we owned approximately 197.5 million AAP units, which represented an approximate 85% limited partner interest in AAP. AAP currently receives all of its cash flows from its ownership of PAA common units. Therefore, our cash flow and resulting ability to make distributions is dependent upon the ability of PAA to make distributions to AAP in respect of the common units AAP owns. As of December 31, 2024, AAP owned approximately 232.9 million PAA common units. The actual amount of cash that PAA, and correspondingly AAP, will have available for distribution will primarily depend on the amount of cash PAA generates from its operations. Also, under the terms of the agreements governing PAA’s debt, PAA is prohibited from declaring or paying any distribution to unitholders if a default or event of default (as defined in such agreements) exists. No such default has occurred. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Credit Agreements, Commercial Paper Program and Indentures.”
Our general partner owns a non-economic general partner interest in us, which does not entitle it to receive cash distributions.

Executive Summary
Company Overview
We are a Delaware limited partnership formed in 2013 that has elected to be taxed as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes. As of December 31, 2024, our sole cash-generating assets consisted of an approximate 85% limited partner interest in AAP through our ownership of approximately 197.5 million AAP units. We also own a 100% managing member interest in GP LLC. GP LLC is a Delaware limited liability company that holds the non-economic general partner interest in AAP. AAP is a Delaware limited partnership that, as of December 31, 2024, directly owned a limited partner interest in PAA through its ownership of approximately 232.9 million PAA common units (approximately 30% of PAA’s total outstanding common units and Series A preferred units combined). AAP is the sole member of PAA GP, a Delaware limited liability company that directly holds the non-economic general partner interest in PAA. 
PAA’s business model integrates large-scale supply aggregation capabilities with the ownership and operation of critical midstream infrastructure systems that connect major producing regions to key demand centers and export terminals. As one of the largest crude oil midstream service providers in North America, PAA owns an extensive network of pipeline transportation, terminalling, storage and gathering assets in key crude oil and NGL producing basins (including the Permian Basin) and transportation corridors and at major market hubs in the United States and Canada. PAA’s assets and the services it provides are primarily focused on crude oil and NGL.
Market Overview and Outlook 
Crude oil and other petroleum liquids are supplied to the global market by producers around the world, with the majority coming from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”), North American producers and the Russian Federation, among others. The chart below depicts the relationship between global supply of crude oil and other petroleum liquids and demand since the beginning of 2020 and the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (“EIA”) Short-Term Energy Outlook as of January 2025:

We believe that the combination of population growth and progressively improving living standards for non-OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries underpins increasing energy demand globally for decades to come. We believe reliable, affordable, and responsible energy resources are all critical components to maintain energy security and global stability, requiring all sources of energy including both hydrocarbons and renewables.
Consistent with the forecast from the EIA’s Short-Term Energy Outlook (as depicted in the chart above), we expect crude oil demand to continue to increase, driven largely by our view that hydrocarbon-based fuels are the most efficient fuels for the transportation of people and goods, and hydrocarbon-based products provide the building blocks for modern civilization such as fertilizers, plastics and cement.
North America has proven to be an essential and reliable source of crude oil and NGL production growth for the global market. This is driven by the lifting of the U.S. crude oil export ban, infrastructure debottlenecking in both the U.S. and Canada, and world-class geological formations unlocked through technological improvements and techniques.
The Permian Basin continues to be one of the most prolific basins in the world and was the predominant driver of U.S. production growth in 2024. We expect the Permian Basin to be a key contributor to global supply for years to come, based on strong economics and the recent wave of consolidation leading to more stable activity levels over a wide range of commodity price environments.
It is against this macro energy market backdrop that we expect to generate significant positive free cash flow on a multi-year basis, supported by our existing asset base and integrated business model. Our financial strategy and long-term capital allocation framework is focused on generating meaningful multi-year free cash flow and improving shareholder returns by (i) increasing returns of capital to equity holders, primarily through increased distributions, (ii) making disciplined accretive investments and (iii) maintaining an investment grade credit profile and ensuring balance sheet flexibility.  
Overview of Operating Results
We recognized net income of $1.070 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to net income of $1.425 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
72
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
The decrease in net income was largely driven by higher costs in the 2024 period associated with the Line 901 incident that occurred in May 2015 (including $225 million related to the write-off of a receivable for insurance proceeds in the fourth quarter of 2024 and $120 million related to settlements in the third quarter of 2024), losses on asset sales, asset impairments and other related items (as compared to gains from such items in the 2023 period), and higher income tax expense largely associated with Canadian withholding tax. In addition, net income for the 2023 period included the favorable impact of gains from the mark-to-market adjustment of the Preferred Distribution Rate Reset Option. However, our Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased in 2024 compared to 2023 due to more favorable results from our Crude Oil segment, partially offset by lower contributions from our NGL segment. See the “—Results of Operations” section below for further discussion.

Revenues and Purchases 
Fluctuations in our consolidated revenues and purchases and related costs are primarily associated with our merchant activities and are generally explained by changes in commodity prices and the impact of gains and losses related to derivative instruments used to manage our commodity price exposure. Because both product sales revenues and purchases and related costs are generally based off of the same pricing indices, the market price of the commodities will not necessarily have an impact on the absolute margins related to those sales and purchases.

Product sales revenues and purchases increased for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to higher crude oil sales volumes.
Revenues from services increased for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to higher pipeline volumes and tariff escalations, as well as the impact of acquisitions.
See further discussion of net revenues (revenues less purchases and related costs) in the “—Analysis of Operating Segments” section below.
Field Operating Costs
See discussion of field operating costs in the “—Analysis of Operating Segments” section below.
General and Administrative Expenses
The increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to (i) higher employee-related costs, (ii) higher information systems costs due to ongoing systems integration work and (iii) higher office rent due to an operating cost abatement in the prior year.
Gains/(Losses) on Asset Sales, Asset Impairments and Other, Net
The net loss on asset sales and asset impairments for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily due to non-cash charges related to the write-down of certain of our long-lived U.S. terminal assets included in our NGL segment due to asset impairments and accelerated depreciation in the fourth quarter of 2024.
The net gain on asset sales and asset impairments for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily related to the sale of our ownership interest in the Keyera Fort Saskatchewan facility in the first quarter of 2023.
See Note 6 and Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these asset sales and asset impairments.
Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Entities
See discussion of equity earnings in unconsolidated entities in the “—Analysis of Operating Segments” section below.
Gain on Investments in Unconsolidated Entities, Net
In the fourth quarter of 2024, we recognized a gain of $15 million related to our acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in Midway Pipeline LLC.
In the third quarter of 2023, we recognized a gain of $29 million related to the Permian JV’s acquisition of the remaining 43% interest in OMOG JV Holdings LLC.
See Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these transactions.

The activity during the periods presented was primarily related to the impact from the change in the United States Dollar to Canadian dollar exchange rate on the portion of our intercompany net investment that is not long-term in nature.
Income Tax (Expense)/Benefit
The net unfavorable income tax variance for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to higher income tax expense in 2024 associated with Canadian withholding tax on dividends from our Canadian entities to other Plains entities driven by timing of dividend payments, including proceeds from asset divestitures, partially offset by the impact of lower earnings at PAA on income tax attributable to PAGP.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, management uses additional measures known as “non-GAAP financial measures” in its evaluation of past performance and prospects for the future. The primary additional measures used by management are Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA attributable to PAA.
Our definition and calculation of certain non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA attributable to PAA are reconciled to Net Income, the most directly comparable measures as reported in accordance with GAAP, and should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes.
75
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
Non-GAAP Financial Performance Measures
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before (i) interest expense, (ii) income tax (expense)/benefit, (iii) depreciation and amortization (including our proportionate share of depreciation and amortization, including write-downs related to cancelled projects and impairments, of unconsolidated entities), (iv) gains and losses on asset sales, asset impairments and other, net and (v) gains on investments in unconsolidated entities, net, and adjusted for (vi) certain selected items impacting comparability. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to PAA excludes the portion of Adjusted EBITDA that is attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated joint venture entities.
Management believes that the presentation of such additional financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our performance and results of operations because these measures, when used to supplement related GAAP financial measures, (i) provide additional information about our core operating performance, (ii) provide investors with the same financial analytical framework upon which management bases financial, operational, compensation and planning/budgeting decisions and (iii) present measures that investors, rating agencies and debt holders have indicated are useful in assessing us and our results of operations. These non-GAAP financial performance measures may exclude, for example, (i) charges for obligations that are expected to be settled with the issuance of equity instruments, (ii) gains and losses on derivative instruments that are related to underlying activities in another period (or the reversal of such adjustments from a prior period), gains and losses on derivatives that are either related to investing activities (such as the purchase of linefill) or purchases of long-term inventory, and inventory valuation adjustments, as applicable, (iii) long-term inventory costing adjustments, (iv) items that are not indicative of our core operating results and/or (v) other items that we believe should be excluded in understanding our core operating performance. These measures may further be adjusted to include amounts related to deficiencies associated with minimum volume commitments whereby we have billed the counterparties for their deficiency obligation and such amounts are recognized as deferred revenue in “Other current liabilities” in our Consolidated Financial Statements. We also adjust for amounts billed by our equity method investees related to deficiencies under minimum volume commitments. Such amounts are presented net of applicable amounts subsequently recognized into revenue. We have defined all such items as “selected items impacting comparability.” We do not necessarily consider all of our selected items impacting comparability to be non-recurring, infrequent or unusual, but we believe that an understanding of these selected items impacting comparability is material to the evaluation of our operating results and prospects. 
Although we present selected items impacting comparability that management considers in evaluating our performance, you should also be aware that the items presented do not represent all items that affect comparability between the periods presented. Variations in our operating results are also caused by changes in volumes, prices, exchange rates, mechanical interruptions, acquisitions, divestitures, investment capital projects and numerous other factors as discussed, as applicable, in “—Analysis of Operating Segments.”

Analysis of Operating Segments 
We manage our operations through two operating segments: Crude Oil and NGL. Our Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) (our Chief Executive Officer) evaluates segment performance based on a variety of measures including Segment Adjusted EBITDA, segment volumes and maintenance capital investment. 
We define Segment Adjusted EBITDA as revenues and equity earnings in unconsolidated entities less (a) significant segment expenses including: (i) purchases and related costs, (ii) field operating costs and (iii) segment general and administrative expenses, plus (b) our proportionate share of the depreciation and amortization expense (including write-downs related to cancelled projects and impairments) of unconsolidated entities, further adjusted (c) for certain selected items including (i) gains and losses on derivative instruments that are related to underlying activities in another period (or the reversal of such adjustments from a prior period), gains and losses on derivatives that are either related to investing activities (such as the purchase of linefill) or purchases of long-term inventory, and inventory valuation adjustments, as applicable, (ii) long-term inventory costing adjustments, (iii) charges for obligations that are expected to be settled with the issuance of equity instruments, (iv) amounts related to deficiencies associated with minimum volume commitments, net of the applicable amounts subsequently recognized into revenue and (v) other items that our CODM believes are integral to understanding our core segment operating performance and (d) to exclude the portion of all preceding items that is attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated joint venture entities (“Segment amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated joint ventures”). See Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA to Net income attributable to PAGP.
In connection with our merchant activities, our Crude Oil and NGL segments may enter into intersegment transactions for the purchase or sale of products, along with services such as the transportation, terminalling or storage of products. Intersegment transactions are conducted at rates similar to those charged to third parties or rates that we believe approximate market. Intersegment activities are eliminated in consolidation and we believe that the estimates with respect to these rates are reasonable. Also, our segment operating and general and administrative expenses reflect direct costs attributable to each segment; however, we also allocate certain operating expenses and general and administrative overhead expenses between segments based on management’s assessment of the business activities for the period. The proportional allocations by segment require judgment by management and may be adjusted in the future based on the business activities that exist during each period. We believe that the estimates with respect to these allocations are reasonable.
Revenues and expenses from our Canadian based subsidiaries, which use CAD as their functional currency, are translated at the prevailing average exchange rates for the month.
Crude Oil Segment
Our Crude Oil segment operations generally consist of gathering and transporting crude oil using pipelines (including gathering systems), trucks and, at times, on barges or railcars, in addition to providing terminalling, storage and other related services utilizing our integrated assets across the United States and Canada. Our assets provide services to third parties as well as to our merchant activities. Our merchant activities include the purchase of crude oil supply and the movement of this supply on our assets or third-party assets to sales locations, including our terminals, third-party connecting carriers, regional hubs or to refineries. Our merchant activities are governed by our risk management policies.
Our Crude Oil segment generates revenue through a combination of tariffs, pipeline capacity agreements and other transportation fees, month-to-month and multi-year storage and terminalling agreements and the sale of gathered and bulk-purchased crude oil. Tariffs and other fees on our pipeline systems are typically based on volumes transported and vary by receipt point and delivery point. Fees for our terminalling and storage services are based on capacity leases and throughput volumes. Generally, results from our merchant activities are impacted by (i) increases or decreases in our lease gathering crude oil purchases volumes and (ii) volatility in commodity price differentials, particularly grade and location differentials, as well as time spreads. The segment results also include the direct fixed and variable field costs of operating the crude oil assets, as well as an allocation of indirect operating costs.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA
Crude Oil Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to higher tariff volumes on our pipelines, tariff escalations and contributions from acquisitions, partially offset by fewer market-based opportunities.
The following is a more detailed discussion of the significant factors impacting Segment Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.
Net Revenues and Equity Earnings. 
Our results were favorably impacted by (i) volume growth across our pipeline systems driven by increased production in the Permian Basin region, as well as increased movements from the Rocky Mountain region to Cushing, Oklahoma, (ii) the benefit of tariff escalations and (iii) contributions from acquisitions, including increases in ownership of certain pipeline systems.
Additionally, our results for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023 reflect fewer crude oil market-based opportunities. 
Field Operating Costs.
 For the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized higher expenses associated with (i) an increase in costs associated with settlements related to the Line 901 incident that occurred in May 2015 (which impact field operating costs, but are excluded from Segment Adjusted EBITDA, and thus are reflected as a component of “Other segment items” in the table above), (ii) an increase in estimated costs for long-term environmental remediation obligations, (iii) property taxes due to the impact of favorable adjustments in 2023 and (iv) incremental operating costs and employee-related costs associated with acquisitions, partially offset by (v) unrealized mark-to-market gains on power hedges (which impact our field operating costs but are excluded from Segment Adjusted EBITDA and thus are reflected as a component of “Other segment items” in the table above) and (vi) decreased costs resulting from lower third-party trucked volumes.
Maintenance Capital
Maintenance capital consists of capital expenditures for the replacement and/or refurbishment of partially or fully depreciated assets in order to maintain the operating and/or earnings capacity of our existing assets. The increase in maintenance capital spending for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to (i) an increase in integrity management, maintenance and repairs and replacement projects and (ii) more trucking lease buyouts.
NGL Segment
Our NGL segment operations involve natural gas processing and NGL fractionation, storage, transportation and terminalling. Our NGL revenues are primarily derived from a combination of (i) providing gathering, fractionation, storage, and/or terminalling services to third-party customers for a fee, and (ii) our merchant activities of extracting NGL mix from the gas stream processed at our Empress straddle plant facility as well as acquiring NGL mix, which is then transported, stored and fractionated into finished products and sold to customers. The commodity exposure associated with our merchant activities is governed by our risk management policies.
80
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
Generally, our segment results are impacted by (i) increases or decreases in our NGL sales volumes, (ii) volatility in commodity price differentials, primarily the differential between the price of natural gas and the extracted NGL (“frac spread”), as well as location differentials and time spreads, (iii) the quality and volume of natural gas transported on third-party assets through our Empress straddle plant and (iv) our share of the NGL received from a third-party straddle plant.
Our NGL operations are sensitive to weather-related demand, particularly during the approximate five-month peak heating season of November through March, and temperature differences from period-to-period may have a significant effect on NGL demand, and thus our financial performance, as well as the impact of comparative performance between financial reporting periods that bisect the five-month peak heating season.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA
NGL Segment Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2024 decreased compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to the impact of lower realized frac spreads, partially offset by higher propane and butane sales volumes.
Significant variances in the components of Segment Adjusted EBITDA are discussed in more detail below:
Net Revenues. 
Net revenues include the impact of derivative activities and long-term inventory costing adjustments, which are excluded from Segment Adjusted EBITDA and thus are reflected as a component of “Other segment items” in the table above. Excluding such impacts, net revenues decreased for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to (i) lower realized frac spreads and (ii) lower field operating cost recoveries at our Empress straddle plants realized through our commercial agreements, partially offset by (iii) higher propane and butane sales volumes, (iv) tariff escalations and (v) market opportunities.
Field Operating Costs.
 The decrease in field operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to (i) decreased utilities-related costs largely as a result of lower prices and (ii) a decrease in unrealized mark-to-market losses on power hedges (which impact our field operating costs, but are excluded from Segment Adjusted EBITDA, and thus are reflected as a component of “Other segment items” in the table above), partially offset by (iii) higher maintenance and repairs. The decrease in utilities-related costs was partially offset by the lower benefit to net revenues of operating cost recoveries realized through commercial agreements.
Maintenance Capital

The decrease in maintenance capital spending for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to timing of routine integrity activities.
Liquidity and Capital Resources 
General
Our primary sources of liquidity are (i) cash flow from operating activities and (ii) borrowings under PAA’s credit facilities or commercial paper program. In addition, we may supplement these primary sources of liquidity with proceeds from asset sales, and in the past have utilized funds received from sales of equity and debt securities. Our primary cash requirements include, but are not limited to, (i) ordinary course of business uses, such as the payment of amounts related to the purchase of crude oil, NGL and other products, payment of other expenses and interest payments on outstanding debt, (ii) investment and maintenance capital activities, (iii) acquisitions of assets or businesses, (iv) repayment of principal on long-term debt and (v) distributions to our Class A shareholders and noncontrolling interests. In addition, we may use cash for repurchases of common equity. We generally expect to fund our short-term cash requirements through cash flow generated from operating activities and/or borrowings under PAA’s credit facilities or commercial paper program. In addition, we generally expect to fund our long-term needs, such as those resulting from investment capital activities, acquisitions or refinancing long-term debt, through a variety of sources, which may include any or a combination of the sources listed above. 
As of December 31, 2024, although we had a working capital deficit of $148 million, we had over $2.6 billion of liquidity available to meet our ongoing operating, investing and financing needs, subject to continued covenant compliance, as noted below (in millions):

Represents availability prior to giving effect to borrowings outstanding under the PAA commercial paper program, which reduce available capacity under the facilities. 
(2)
Available capacity under the PAA senior unsecured revolving credit facility and the PAA senior secured hedged inventory facility was reduced by outstanding letters of credit issued under these facilities of less than $1 million and $17 million, respectively.
(3)
Excludes restricted cash of $1 million.
Usage of PAA’s credit facilities, which provide the financial backstop for PAA’s commercial paper program, is subject to ongoing compliance with covenants, as discussed further below. PAA’s borrowing capacity and borrowing costs are also impacted by its credit rating. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks Related to PAA’s Business—Loss of PAA’s investment grade credit rating or the ability to receive open credit could negatively affect its borrowing costs, ability to purchase crude oil, NGL and natural gas supplies or to capitalize on market opportunities.”
We believe that we have, and will continue to have, the ability to access PAA’s commercial paper program and credit facilities, which we use to meet our short-term cash needs. We believe that our financial position remains strong and we have sufficient liquid assets, cash flow from operating activities and borrowing capacity under PAA’s credit agreements to meet our financial commitments, debt service obligations, contingencies and anticipated capital expenditures. We are, however, subject to business and operational risks that could adversely affect our cash flow, including extended disruptions in the financial markets and/or energy price volatility resulting from current macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, including actions by OPEC. A prolonged material decrease in our cash flows would likely produce an adverse effect on our borrowing capacity and cost of borrowing. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for further discussion regarding risks that may impact our liquidity and capital resources. 
Credit Agreements, Commercial Paper Program and Indentures
PAA has three primary credit arrangements, which we use to meet our short-term cash needs. These include PAA’s $1.35 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility maturing in 2029 (excluding a commitment of $64 million, which matures in 2027), $1.35 billion senior secured hedged inventory facility maturing in 2027 (excluding a commitment of $64 million, which matures in 2026) and $2.7 billion unsecured commercial paper program that is backstopped by PAA’s revolving credit facility and its hedged inventory facility. The credit agreements for PAA’s revolving credit facilities (which impact PAA’s ability to access its commercial paper program because they provide the financial backstop that supports PAA’s short-term credit ratings) and the indentures governing its senior notes contain cross-default provisions. A default under PAA’s credit agreements or indentures would permit the lenders to accelerate the maturity of the outstanding debt. As long as PAA is in compliance with the provisions in its credit agreements, its ability to make distributions of available cash is not restricted. PAA was in compliance with the covenants contained in its credit agreements and indentures as of December 31, 2024. 
Cash Flow from Operating Activities 
The primary drivers of cash flow from operating activities are (i) the collection of amounts related to the sale of crude oil, NGL and other products, the transportation of crude oil and other products for a fee, and the provision of storage and terminalling services for a fee and (ii) the payment of amounts related to the purchase of crude oil, NGL and other products and other expenses, principally field operating costs, general and administrative expenses and interest expense.
Cash flow from operating activities can be materially impacted by the storage of crude oil in periods of a contango market, when the price of crude oil for future deliveries is higher than current prices. In the month we pay for the stored crude oil, we borrow under the PAA credit facilities or commercial paper program (or use cash on hand) to pay for the crude oil, which negatively impacts operating cash flow. Conversely, cash flow from operating activities increases during the period in which we collect the cash from the sale of the stored crude oil. Similarly, the level of NGL and other product inventory stored and held for resale at period end affects our cash flow from operating activities.
83
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
In periods when the market is not in contango, we typically sell our crude oil during the same month in which we purchase it and we do not rely on borrowings under the PAA credit facilities or commercial paper program to pay for the crude oil. During such market conditions, our accounts payable and accounts receivable generally move in tandem as we make payments and receive payments for the purchase and sale of crude oil in the same month, which is the month following such activity. In periods during which we build inventory, regardless of market structure, we may rely on the PAA credit facilities or commercial paper program to pay for the inventory. In addition, we use derivative instruments to manage the risks associated with the purchase and sale of our commodities. Therefore, our cash flow from operating activities may be impacted by the margin deposit requirements related to our derivative activities. See Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion regarding our derivatives and risk management activities.
Net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was approximately $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, and primarily resulted from earnings from our operations.
Investing Activities 
Capital Expenditures
In addition to our operating needs, we also use cash for our investment capital projects, maintenance capital activities and acquisition activities. We fund these expenditures with cash generated by operating activities, financing activities and/or proceeds from asset sales. In the near term, we do not plan to issue common equity to fund such expenditures. The following table summarizes our investment, maintenance and acquisition capital expenditures (in millions):

(2)
Contributions to unconsolidated entities, accounted for under the equity method of accounting, that are related to investment capital projects by such entities are recognized in “Investment capital.” Acquisitions of initial investments or additional interests in unconsolidated entities are included in “Acquisition capital.”
(3)
Investment capital and maintenance capital, net to our 65% interest in the Permian JV, was approximately $329 million and $242 million, respectively, for 2024, and approximately $310 million and $214 million, respectively, for 2023.
(4)
Acquisition capital for 2024 primarily includes the acquisitions of additional ownership interests in equity method investees. Acquisition capital for 2023 primarily includes the acquisition by the Permian JV of (i) the remaining 43% interest in OMOG JV Holdings LLC and (ii) gathering assets in the Southern and Northern Delaware Basins. See Note 7 and Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Acquisition capital, net to our 65% interest in the Permian JV, was approximately $243 million and $281 million for 2024 and 2023, respectively.
In the first quarter of 2025, we completed two additional bolt-on acquisitions for $636 million (approximately $580 million net to our interest), which included (i) a Delaware Basin crude oil gathering business and (ii) an Eagle Ford Basin gathering system. We used a portion of the net proceeds from our January 2025 senior notes offering to fund these acquisitions.
Investment Capital Projects
Our investment capital programs consist of investments in midstream infrastructure projects that build upon our core assets and operations. The majority of this investment capital consists of highly-contracted projects that complement our broader system capabilities and support the long-term needs of the upstream and downstream sectors of the industry value chain.

Projected 2025 Capital Expenditures.
 Total investment capital for the year ending December 31, 2025 is currently projected to be approximately $500 million ($400 million net to our interest). Approximately half of our projected investment capital expenditures are expected to be invested in the Permian JV assets. Additionally, maintenance capital for 2025 is currently projected to be approximately $260 million ($240 million net to our interest). We expect to fund our 2025 investment and maintenance capital expenditures primarily with retained cash flow.
Divestitures
 Proceeds from the sale of assets have historically generally been used to fund our investment capital projects and reduce debt levels. The following table summarizes the proceeds received from divestitures during the last two years (in millions):

See Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Ongoing Activities Related to Strategic Transactions

We are continuously engaged in the evaluation of potential transactions that support our current business strategy. In the past, such transactions have included the acquisition of assets that complement our existing footprint, the sale of non-core assets, the sale of partial interests in assets to strategic joint venture partners, and large investment capital projects. With respect to a potential acquisition or divestiture, we may conduct an auction process or participate in an auction process conducted by a third party or we may negotiate a transaction with one or a limited number of potential sellers (in the case of an acquisition) or buyers (in the case of a divestiture). Such transactions could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
We typically do not announce a transaction until after we have executed a definitive agreement. In certain cases, in order to protect our business interests or for other reasons, we may defer public announcement of a transaction until closing or a later date. Past experience has demonstrated that discussions and negotiations regarding a potential transaction can advance or terminate in a short period of time. Moreover, the closing of any transaction for which we have entered into a definitive agreement may be subject to customary and other closing conditions, which may not ultimately be satisfied or waived. Accordingly, we can give no assurance that our current or future efforts with respect to any such transactions will be successful, and we can provide no assurance that our financial expectations with respect to such transactions will ultimately be realized. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks Related to PAA’s Business—Acquisitions and divestitures involve risks that may adversely affect PAA’s business.”

Financing Activities 
Our financing activities primarily relate to funding investment capital projects, acquisitions and refinancing of debt maturities, as well as short-term working capital (including borrowings for NYMEX and ICE margin deposits) and hedged inventory borrowings related to our NGL business and contango market activities. 
Borrowings and Repayments Under Credit Arrangements
During the year ended December 31, 2024, PAA had net repayments under its commercial paper program of $40 million. The net repayments resulted primarily from cash flow from operating activities and proceeds from the issuance of $650 million, 5.70% senior notes in June 2024, which offset borrowings during the year related to funding needs for capital investments, inventory purchases, repayment of $750 million, 3.60% senior notes due November 2024 and other general partnership purposes.
During the year ended December 31, 2023, PAA had net borrowings under the PAA commercial paper program of $433 million. The net borrowings resulted primarily from borrowings during the year related to funding needs for capital investments, inventory purchases and other general partnership purposes.

PAA used the net proceeds from the offering, along with other cash on hand, to repay on November 1, 2024 the principal amount of its $750 million, 3.60% senior notes due November 2024. Prior to such repayment, PAA used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to repay outstanding borrowings under its commercial paper program and for general partnership purposes.
In January 2025, PAA also completed the offering of $1 billion, 5.95% senior notes due June 2035 at a public offering price of 99.761%. Interest payments are due on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing on June 15, 2025. PAA used the net proceeds from this offering of approximately $988 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses, to (i) fund the acquisitions completed during the first quarter of 2025, (ii) fund the repurchase in January 2025 of 12.7 million PAA Series A preferred units, including accrued and unpaid distributions and (iii) repay outstanding borrowings under its credit facilities and commercial paper program, and, pending such uses, for general partnership purposes. See Note 7 and Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our recently completed acquisitions and PAA’s Series A preferred units, respectively.

Registration Statements
PAGP Registration Statements. 
 We have filed with the SEC a shelf registration statement that, subject to effectiveness at the time of use, allows us to issue up to a specified amount of equity securities (“PAGP Traditional Shelf”). At December 31, 2024, we had approximately $939 million of unsold securities available under the PAGP Traditional Shelf. We also have access to a universal shelf registration statement (“PAGP WKSI Shelf”), which provides us with the ability to offer and sell an unlimited amount of equity securities, subject to market conditions and its capital needs.
PAA Registration Statements
.  PAA periodically accesses the capital markets for both equity and debt financing. PAA has filed with the SEC a universal shelf registration statement that, subject to effectiveness at the time of use, allows PAA to issue up to a specified amount of debt or equity securities (“PAA Traditional Shelf”), under which PAA had approximately $1.1 billion of unsold securities available at December 31, 2024. PAA did not conduct any offering under its Traditional Shelf during the year 2024. PAA also has access to a universal shelf registration statement (“PAA WKSI Shelf”), which provides it with the ability to offer and sell an unlimited amount of debt and equity securities, subject to market conditions and capital needs. The offerings of $650 million, 5.70% senior notes in June 2024 and $1 billion, 5.95% senior notes in January 2025 were conducted under its WKSI Shelf.
Common Equity Repurchase Program

In November 2020, the board of directors of our general partner approved a $500 million common equity repurchase program (the “Program”) to be utilized as an additional method of returning capital to investors. The Program authorizes the repurchase from time to time of up to $500 million of PAA’s common units and/or our Class A shares via open market purchases or negotiated transactions conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. Ultimately, the amount, timing and pace of potential repurchase activity will be determined by a number of factors, including market conditions, PAA’s financial performance and flexibility, PAA’s actual and expected free cash flow after distributions, the absolute and relative equity prices of PAA’s common units and our Class A shares, and the extent to which PAA is positioned to achieve and maintain its targeted leverage ratio. No time limit has been set for completion of the Program, and the Program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The Program does not obligate PAA or us to acquire a particular number of common units or Class A shares. Any PAA common units or Class A shares that are repurchased will be canceled.
There were no repurchases under the Program during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. The remaining available capacity under the Program as of December 31, 2024 was $198 million.

Preferred Unit Repurchase
On January 31, 2025, PAA repurchased 12.7 million units, or 18%, of its outstanding Series A preferred units at the issue price of $26.25 per unit for a purchase price of approximately $333 million, plus accrued and unpaid distributions through January 30, 2025 of approximately $10 million. PAA used a portion of the net proceeds from its January 2025 senior notes offering to fund this repurchase. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding PAA’s Series A preferred units.
Distributions to Our Class A Shareholders  
We distribute 100% of our available cash to our Class A shareholders of record within 55 days following the end of each quarter. Available cash is generally defined as all of our cash and cash equivalents on hand at the end of each quarter less reserves established in the discretion of our general partner for future requirements. Our levels of financial reserves are established by our general partner and include reserves for, among other things, the proper conduct of our business (including future capital expenditures and anticipated credit needs), compliance with legal or contractual obligations and funding of future distributions to our shareholders.  See Item 5. “Market for Registrant’s Shares, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities—Cash Distribution Policy” for additional discussion regarding distributions.
On February 14, 2025, we paid a quarterly distribution of $0.38 per Class A share ($1.52 per Class A share on an annualized basis). The distribution was paid to Class A shareholders of record as of January 31, 2025, with respect to the quarter ended December 31, 2024. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for details of distributions paid during the three years ended December 31, 2024.
Distributions to Noncontrolling Interests

Distributions to noncontrolling interests represent amounts paid on interests in consolidated entities that are not owned by us. As of December 31, 2024, noncontrolling interests in our subsidiaries consisted of (i) limited partner interests in PAA including a 70% interest in PAA’s common units and PAA’s Series A preferred units combined and 100% of PAA’s Series B preferred units, (ii) an approximate 15% limited partner interest in AAP, (iii) a 35% interest in the Permian JV, (iv) a 30% interest in Cactus II and (v) a 33% interest in Red River. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for details of distributions paid to noncontrolling interests during the three years ended December 31, 2024.
Distributions to PAA’s Series A preferred unitholders.
 Holders of PAA’s Series A preferred units are entitled to receive quarterly distributions, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, of $0.615 per unit ($2.46 per unit annualized).

Distributions to PAA’s Series B preferred unitholders.
 Holders of PAA’s Series B preferred units are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by PAA’s general partner out of legally available funds for such purpose, cumulative cash distributions, as applicable. Distributions on the Series B preferred units accumulate based on the applicable three-month SOFR, plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.26161%, plus 4.11% per annum. The distribution rate for the quarterly distribution paid on February 18, 2025 was 8.89507% per annum ($22.73 per Series B preferred unit).
Distributions to PAA’s common unitholders. 
On February 14, 2025, PAA paid a quarterly distribution of $0.38 per common unit ($1.52 per common unit on an annualized basis). The total distribution of $267 million was paid to common unitholders of record as of January 31, 2025, with respect to the quarter ended December 31, 2024. 
See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for details of distributions paid during the three years ended December 31, 2024.

Purchase Obligations
In the ordinary course of doing business, we purchase crude oil and NGL from third parties under contracts, the majority of which range in term from thirty-day evergreen to five years, with a limited number of contracts with remaining terms extending up to 10 years. We establish a margin for these purchases by entering into various types of physical and financial sale and exchange transactions through which we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced between purchases on the one hand and sales and future delivery obligations on the other. We do not expect to use a significant amount of internal capital to meet these obligations, as the obligations will be funded by corresponding sales to entities that we deem creditworthy or who have provided credit support we consider adequate.
The following table includes our best estimate of the amount and timing of these payments as of December 31, 2024 (in millions):

Amounts are primarily based on estimated volumes and market prices based on average activity during December 2024. The actual physical volume purchased and actual settlement prices will vary from the assumptions used in the table. Uncertainties involved in these estimates include levels of production at the wellhead, weather conditions, changes in market prices and other conditions beyond our control.
Letters of Credit.
 In connection with our merchant activities, we provide certain suppliers with irrevocable standby letters of credit to secure our obligation for the purchase and transportation of crude oil, NGL and natural gas. Our liabilities with respect to these purchase obligations are recorded in accounts payable on our balance sheet in the month the product is purchased. Generally, these letters of credit are issued for periods of up to seventy days and are terminated upon completion of each transaction. Additionally, we issue letters of credit to support insurance programs, derivative transactions, including hedging-related margin obligations, and construction activities. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had outstanding letters of credit of approximately $90 million and $205 million, respectively.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by Item 303 of Regulation S-K.
Investments in Unconsolidated Entities 
We have invested in entities that are not consolidated in our financial statements. None of these entities had debt outstanding as of  December 31, 2024.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and rules and regulations of the SEC requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements. Such estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although we believe these estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for our (i) estimated fair value of assets and liabilities acquired and identification of associated goodwill and intangible assets, (ii) fair value of derivatives, (iii) accruals and contingent liabilities, (iv) property and equipment, depreciation and amortization expense and asset retirement obligations, (v) impairment assessments of property and equipment, investments in unconsolidated entities and intangible assets and (vi) inventory valuations have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. These areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules which require us to make judgments and estimates. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates, which are discussed below. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities Acquired and Identification of Associated Goodwill and Intangible Assets.
 In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) guidance regarding business combinations, with each acquisition, we allocate the cost of the acquired entity to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. If the initial accounting for the business combination is incomplete when the combination occurs, an estimate will be recorded. We also expense the transaction costs as incurred in connection with each acquisition, except for acquisitions of equity method investments. In addition, we are required to recognize intangible assets separately from goodwill.
Determining the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired, as well as intangible assets that relate to such items as customer relationships, acreage dedications and other contracts, involves professional judgment and is ultimately based on acquisition models and management’s assessment of the value of the assets acquired and, to the extent available, third-party assessments.
In the third quarter of 2023, our Permian JV acquired the remaining 43% interest in OMOG JV Holdings LLC (“OMOG”) and certain gathering assets in the Southern Delaware basin from Rattler Midstream Operating LLC. The transaction had an aggregate purchase price of $294 million ($191 million net to our 65% interest in the Permian JV). As a result of the transaction, the Permian JV now owns 100% of OMOG and its subsidiaries and such entities are reflected as consolidated subsidiaries in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Prior to this transaction, the Permian JV’s 57% interest in OMOG was accounted for as an equity method investment. See Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the methods, assumptions and estimates used in the determination of the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired and identification of associated intangible assets.
In November 2022, we and Enbridge Inc. (“Enbridge”) purchased Western Midstream Partners, LP (“WES”)’s 15% interest in Cactus II Pipeline, LLC (“Cactus II”) for an aggregate amount of $265 million. Enbridge acquired 10% and we acquired 5% of Cactus II, with each paying a proportionate share of the purchase price. We and Enbridge are now the sole owners of Cactus II, with 70% and 30% respective ownership interests. We previously accounted for our 65% interest in Cactus II as an equity method investment. In addition to the change in ownership, there were changes in governance which led to a change in control. We now control Cactus II and reflect Cactus II as a consolidated subsidiary in our Consolidated Financial Statements, with Enbridge’s 30% interest reflected as a noncontrolling interest. See Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the methods, assumptions and estimates used in the determination of the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired and identification of associated intangible assets.
Fair Value of Derivatives.
 The fair value of a derivative at a particular period end does not reflect the end results of a particular transaction, and will most likely not reflect the gain or loss at the conclusion of a transaction. We reflect estimates for these items based on our internal records and information from third parties. We have commodity derivatives and interest rate derivatives that are accounted for as assets and liabilities at fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The valuations of our derivatives that are exchange traded are based on market prices on the applicable exchange on the last day of the period. For our derivatives that are not exchange traded, the estimates we use are based on indicative broker quotations or an internal valuation model. Our valuation models utilize market observable inputs such as price, volatility, correlation and other factors and may not be reflective of the price at which they can be settled due to the lack of a liquid market. Less than 1% of total annual revenues are based on estimates derived from internal valuation models.

Index to Financial Statements
Although the resolution of the uncertainties involved in these estimates has not historically had a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition, we cannot provide assurance that actual amounts will not vary significantly from estimated amounts. See Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion regarding our derivatives and risk management activities.
Accruals and Contingent Liabilities.
  We record accruals or liabilities for, among other things, environmental remediation, potential legal claims or settlements and fees for legal services associated with loss contingencies, and bonuses. Accruals are made when our assessment indicates that it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of liability can be reasonably estimated. Our estimates are based on all known facts at the time and our assessment of the ultimate outcome. Among the many uncertainties that impact our estimates are the necessary regulatory approvals for, and potential modification of, our environmental remediation plans, the limited amount of data available upon initial assessment of the impact of soil or water contamination, changes in costs associated with environmental remediation services and equipment, the duration of the natural resource damage assessment and the ultimate amount of damages determined, the determination and calculation of fines and penalties, the possibility of existing legal claims giving rise to additional claims and the nature, extent and cost of legal services that will be required in connection with lawsuits, claims and other matters. Our estimates for contingent liability accruals are increased or decreased as additional information is obtained or resolution is achieved. A hypothetical variance of 5% in our aggregate estimate for the accruals and contingent liabilities discussed above would have an impact on earnings of up to approximately $13 million. Although the resolution of these uncertainties has not historically had a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition, we cannot provide assurance that actual amounts will not vary significantly from estimated amounts.
Property and Equipment, Depreciation and Amortization Expense and Asset Retirement Obligations.
 We compute depreciation and amortization based on estimated useful lives. These estimates are based on various factors including condition, manufacturing specifications, technological advances and historical data concerning useful lives of similar assets. Uncertainties that impact these estimates include changes in laws and regulations relating to restoration and abandonment requirements, economic conditions and supply and demand in the area. When assets are put into service, we make estimates with respect to useful lives and salvage values that we believe are reasonable. However, subsequent events could cause us to change our estimates, thus impacting the future calculation of depreciation and amortization.
We record retirement obligations associated with tangible long-lived assets based on estimates related to the costs associated with cleaning, purging and, in some cases, completely removing the assets and returning the land to its original state. In addition, our estimates include a determination of the settlement date or dates for the potential obligation, which may or may not be determinable. Uncertainties that impact these estimates include the costs associated with these activities and the timing of incurring such costs. A hypothetical variance of 5% in our aggregate estimate for the retirement obligations discussed above would have an impact on earnings of up to approximately $7 million. Although the resolution of these uncertainties has not historically had a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition, we cannot provide assurance that actual amounts will not vary significantly from estimated amounts.
See Note 6 and Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our property and equipment, intangible assets and depreciation and amortization expense. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our asset retirement obligations.
Impairment Assessments of Property and Equipment, Investments in Unconsolidated Entities and Intangible Assets. 
We periodically evaluate property and equipment for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. Any evaluation is highly dependent on the underlying assumptions of related cash flows. We consider the fair value estimate used to calculate impairment of property and equipment a critical accounting estimate. In determining the existence of an impairment of carrying value, we make a number of subjective assumptions as to:
•
whether there is an event or circumstance that may be indicative of an impairment;
•
the grouping of assets;
•
the intention of “holding”, “abandoning” or “selling” an asset;
•
the forecast of undiscounted expected future cash flow over the asset’s estimated useful life; and
•
if an impairment exists, the fair value of the asset or asset group.
In addition, when we evaluate property and equipment and other long-lived assets for recoverability, it may also be necessary to review related depreciation estimates and methods. 
91
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
Investments in unconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances suggest that a decline in value may be other than temporary. Examples of such events or circumstances include continuing operating losses of the entity and/or long-term negative changes in the entity’s core business. When it is determined that an indicated impairment is other than temporary, a charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying amount and its estimated fair value. We consider the fair value estimate used to calculate the impairment of investments in unconsolidated entities a critical accounting estimate. In determining the existence of an other-than-temporary impairment of carrying value, we make a number of subjective assumptions as to:
•
whether there is an event or circumstance that may be indicative of a decline in value of the investment;
•
whether the decline in value is other than temporary; and
•
the fair value of the investment.
Intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are instead periodically assessed for impairment. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful life as determined by management. Impairment testing entails estimating future net cash flows relating to the business, based on the grouping of assets and management’s estimate of future revenues, future cash flows and market conditions including pricing, demand, competition, operating costs and other factors. Uncertainties associated with these estimates include changes in production decline rates, production interruptions, fluctuations in refinery capacity or product slates, economic obsolescence factors in the area and potential future sources of cash flow. In addition, changes in our weighted average cost of capital from our estimates could have a significant impact on fair value. We cannot provide assurance that actual amounts will not vary significantly from estimated amounts. Resolutions of these uncertainties have resulted, and in the future may result, in impairments that impact our results of operations and financial condition.
A change in our outlook or use could result in impairments that may be material to our results of operations or financial condition. See “—Executive Summary— Market Overview and Outlook” and Note 6, Note 8 and Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Inventory Valuations. 
Inventory, including long-term inventory, primarily consists of crude oil and NGL and is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined using an average cost method within specific inventory pools. At the end of each reporting period, we assess the carrying value of our inventory and use estimates and judgment when making any adjustments necessary to reduce the carrying value to net realizable value. Among the uncertainties that impact our estimates are the applicable quality and location differentials to include in our net realizable value analysis. Additionally, we estimate the upcoming liquidation timing of the inventory. Changes in assumptions made as to the timing of a sale can materially impact net realizable value. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we did not record any charges related to the valuation adjustment of our inventory. See Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding inventory.
Line 901 Incident Insurance Receivable. 
In May 2015, we experienced a crude oil release from our Las Flores to Gaviota Pipeline (Line 901) in Santa Barbara County, California. As of December 31, 2024, we have estimated that the aggregate total costs we have incurred or will incur with respect to the Line 901 incident will be approximately $870 million, which includes actual and projected emergency response and clean-up costs, natural resource damage assessments, fines and penalties incurred, certain third-party claims settlements, and estimated costs associated with our remaining Line 901 lawsuits and claims, as well as estimates for certain legal fees and statutory interest where applicable.
We maintain insurance coverage, which is subject to certain exclusions and deductibles, in the event of such liabilities. In November 2022, we submitted claims to several of our insurance carriers seeking reimbursement for a payment made in October of 2022 to settle a class action lawsuit stemming from the Line 901 incident. As of December 31, 2023, we had recognized a receivable of approximately $225 million, of which we had classified $175 million as a short-term asset with the remaining $50 million recognized as a long-term asset. As of December 31, 2023, we believed that our claim for reimbursement was probable of recovery despite the ongoing arbitration proceedings. However, at that time we also noted that various factors could impact the timing and amount of recovery of our insurance receivable, including future developments that adversely impacted our assessment of the strength of our coverage claims, the outcome of any dispute resolution proceedings with respect to our coverage claims (including arbitration proceedings) and the extent to which insurers may become insolvent in the future. Due to these factors, we noted that we could not provide complete assurance that actual receivable amounts recovered would not vary significantly from our estimated amounts.

Index to Financial Statements
A binding arbitration hearing with respect to our insurance claim against insurers representing $175 million of our total $225 million reimbursement claim concluded in early October 2024, and the arbitration panel’s final and binding decision was returned in January 2025. The panel ruled that a substantial portion of our claims subject to the proceeding were not covered 
under the applicable policy and therefore we were not entitled to reimbursement of our $175 million claim against the applicable insurers. With respect to our remaining $50 million claim against different insurance carriers, we now regard collection of those claims as being less than “probable.” As a result, we wrote off the entire $225 million receivable in the fourth quarter of 2024 and will recognize any future collections as and if they are received. See Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding the Line 901 incident and our related insurance receivable.

See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the effect of recent accounting pronouncements on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to various market risks, including commodity price risk and interest rate risk. We use various derivative instruments to manage such risks and, in certain circumstances, to realize incremental margin during volatile market conditions. Our risk management policies and procedures are designed to help ensure that our hedging activities address our risks by monitoring our exchange-cleared and over-the-counter positions, as well as physical volumes, grades, locations, delivery schedules and storage capacity. We have a risk management function that has direct responsibility and authority for our risk policies, related controls around commercial activities and certain aspects of corporate risk management. Our risk management function also approves all new risk management strategies through a formal process. The following discussion addresses each category of risk.
Commodity Price Risk
We use derivative instruments to hedge price risk associated with the following commodities:
•
Crude oil
We utilize crude oil derivatives to hedge commodity price risk inherent in our pipeline, terminalling and merchant activities. Our objectives for these derivatives include hedging anticipated purchases and sales, stored inventory and basis differentials. We manage these exposures with various instruments including futures, forwards, swaps and options.
•
Natural gas
We utilize natural gas derivatives to hedge commodity price risk inherent in our natural gas processing assets (natural gas purchase component of the frac spread). Additionally, we utilize natural gas derivatives to hedge anticipated operational fuel gas requirements related to our natural gas processing and NGL fractionation plants. We manage these exposures with various instruments including futures, swaps and options.
•
NGL and other
We utilize NGL derivatives, primarily propane and butane derivatives, to hedge commodity price risk inherent in our commercial activities, including the sale of the individual specification products extracted in our natural gas processing assets (sale of specification NGL products component of the frac spread), as well as other net sales of NGL inventory, held mainly at our owned NGL storage terminals. Our objectives for these derivatives include hedging anticipated purchases and sales and stored inventory. We manage these exposures with various instruments including futures, forwards, swaps and options.
See Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding our hedging strategies and objectives.
The fair value of our commodity derivatives and the change in fair value as of December 31, 2024 that would be expected from a 10% price increase or decrease is shown in the table below (in millions):

The fair values presented in the table above reflect the sensitivity of the derivative instruments only and do not include the effect of the underlying hedged commodity. Price-risk sensitivities were calculated by assuming an across-the-board 10% increase or decrease in price regardless of term or historical relationships between the contractual price of the instruments and the underlying commodity price. In the event of an actual 10% change in near-term commodity prices, the fair value of our derivative portfolio would typically change less than that shown in the table as changes in near-term prices are not typically mirrored in delivery months further out.
Interest Rate Risk
Debt
. Our use of variable rate debt and any forecasted issuances of fixed rate debt expose us to interest rate risk. Therefore, from time to time, we use interest rate derivatives to hedge interest rate risk associated with anticipated interest payments and, in certain cases, outstanding debt instruments. All of PAA’s senior notes are fixed rate notes and thus are not subject to interest rate risk. Our variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2024, approximately $393 million, was subject to interest rate resets that generally occur within one week or less. The average interest rate on variable rate debt that was outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2024 was 5.6%, based upon rates in effect during the year. The fair value of our interest rate derivatives was a net asset of $27 million as of December 31, 2024. A 10% increase in the forward SOFR curve as of December 31, 2024 would have resulted in an increase of $13 million to the fair value of our interest rate derivatives. A 10% decrease in the forward SOFR curve as of December 31, 2024 would have resulted in a decrease of $13 million to the fair value of our interest rate derivatives. See Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our interest rate risk hedging activities. 
Series B Preferred Units
. Distributions on PAA’s Series B preferred units accumulate and are payable quarterly in arrears on the 15th day of February, May, August and November. Beginning August 15, 2023, distributions on PAA’s Series B preferred units accumulate based on the applicable three-month SOFR, plus certain adjustments. Based upon the Series B preferred units outstanding at December 31, 2024 and the liquidation preference of $1,000 per unit, a change of 100 basis points in interest rates would increase or decrease the annual distributions on PAA’s Series B preferred units by approximately $8 million. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding PAA’s Series B preferred unit distributions.

Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
Applicable SEC rules require an evaluation of the effectiveness of our DCP. Management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our DCP as of December 31, 2024, the end of the period covered by this report, and, based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our DCP is effective.
Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. “Internal control over financial reporting” is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. See “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting” on page F-2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Our independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as stated in the firm’s report. See “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm” on page F-3 of our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Plains GP Holdings, L.P.’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
Management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled “Internal Control—Integrated Framework” (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) to evaluate the effectiveness of the Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting. Based on that evaluation, management has concluded that the Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.
The effectiveness of the Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on Page F-3.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors of PAA GP Holdings LLC and Shareholders of Plains GP Holdings, L.P.
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Plains GP Holdings, L.P. and its subsidiaries (the “Partnership”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), of changes in partners’ capital and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Partnership as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Partnership maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Partnership’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Partnership’s consolidated financial statements and on the Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Partnership in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
F-3
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the

consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated

financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Revenue Recognition – Crude Oil Sales
As described in Note

3

to the consolidated financial statements, revenue from sales of crude oil are recognized at the time title to the product sold transfers to the purchaser, which occurs upon delivery of the product to the purchaser or its designee. The consideration received under these contracts is variable based on commodity prices. The Partnership recognized crude oil sales of $47,036 million for the year ended December 31, 2024.
The principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition for crude oil sales is a critical audit matter is a high degree of auditor effort in performing procedures related to the Partnership’s revenue recognition.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process for crude oil sales. These procedures also

included, among others (i) testing revenue recognized for a sample of crude oil sales revenue transactions by obtaining and inspecting source documents, such as contracts, settlement statements, invoices, and payment receipts and (ii) confirming a sample of outstanding customer invoice balances as of December 31, 2024, and for confirmations not returned, obtaining and inspecting source documents, such as contracts, settlement statements, invoices, and subsequent payment receipts.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1—
Organization and Basis of Consolidation and Presentation
Organization
Plains GP Holdings, L.P. (“PAGP”) is a Delaware limited partnership formed in 2013 that has elected to be taxed as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes. PAGP does not directly own any operating assets; as of December 31, 2024, its sole source of cash flow is derived from an indirect investment in Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (“PAA”), a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership. As used in this Form 10-K and unless the context indicates otherwise (taking into account the fact that PAGP has no operating activities apart from those conducted by PAA and its subsidiaries), the terms “Partnership,” “we,” “us,” “our,” “ours” and similar terms refer to PAGP and its subsidiaries.
As of December 31, 2024, we owned an approximate 
85
% limited partner interest in Plains AAP, L.P. (“AAP”) through our ownership of approximately 
197.5
 million Class A units of AAP (“AAP units”). We also own a 
100
% managing member interest in Plains All American GP LLC (“GP LLC”), a Delaware limited liability company that holds the non-economic general partner interest in AAP. AAP is a Delaware limited partnership that, as of December 31, 2024, directly owned a limited partner interest in PAA through its ownership of approximately 
232.9
 million PAA common units (approximately 
30
% of PAA’s total outstanding common units and Series A preferred units combined). AAP is the sole member of PAA GP LLC (“PAA GP”), a Delaware limited liability company that directly holds the non-economic general partner interest in PAA. 
PAA’s business model integrates large-scale supply aggregation capabilities with the ownership and operation of critical midstream infrastructure systems that connect major producing regions to key demand centers and export terminals. As one of the largest crude oil midstream service providers in North America, PAA owns an extensive network of pipeline transportation, terminalling, storage and gathering assets in key crude oil and NGL producing basins (including the Permian Basin) and transportation corridors and at major market hubs in the United States and Canada. PAA’s assets and the services it provides are primarily focused on and conducted through 
two
 operating segments: Crude Oil and NGL. See Note 19 for further discussion of our operating segments.
PAA GP Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, is our general partner. Our general partner manages our operations and activities and is responsible for exercising on our behalf any rights we have as the sole and managing member of GP LLC, including responsibility for conducting the business and managing the operations of AAP and PAA. GP LLC employs our domestic officers and personnel involved in the operation and management of AAP and PAA.  PAA’s Canadian officers and personnel are employed by our subsidiary, Plains Midstream Canada ULC.
References to the “Plains Entities” include us, our general partner, GP LLC, AAP, PAA GP and PAA and its subsidiaries.

Basis of Consolidation and Presentation
The accompanying financial statements and related notes present and discuss our consolidated financial position as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the consolidated results of our operations, cash flows, changes in partners’ capital, comprehensive income and changes in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation, and certain reclassifications have been made to information from previous years to conform to the current presentation. 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PAGP and all of its wholly owned subsidiaries and those entities that it controls. Investments in entities over which we have significant influence but not control are accounted for by the equity method. We apply proportionate consolidation for pipelines and other assets in which we own undivided joint interests. Our reporting currency is U.S. dollars, and all references to dollars are U.S. dollars, unless stated otherwise.
Management judgment is required to evaluate whether PAGP controls an entity. Key areas of that evaluation include (i) determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity (“VIE”); (ii) determining whether PAGP is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, including evaluating which activities of the VIE most significantly impact its economic performance and the degree of power that PAGP and its related parties have over those activities through variable interests; and (iii) identifying events that require reconsideration of whether an entity is a VIE and continuously evaluating whether PAGP is a VIE’s primary beneficiary. 
We have determined that our subsidiaries, PAA and AAP, are VIEs and should be consolidated by PAGP because:
•
The limited partners of PAA and AAP lack (i) substantive “kick-out rights” (i.e., the right to remove the general partner) based on a simple majority or lower vote and (ii) substantive participation rights and thus lack the ability to block actions of the general partner that most significantly impact the economic performance of PAA and AAP, respectively.  
•
AAP is the primary beneficiary of PAA because it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact PAA’s performance and the right to receive benefits, and obligation to absorb losses, that could be significant to PAA.
•
PAGP is the primary beneficiary of AAP because it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact AAP’s performance and the right to receive benefits, and obligation to absorb losses, that could be significant to AAP.

With the exception of a deferred tax asset of $
1.220
 billion and $
1.239
 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, substantially all assets and liabilities presented on PAGP’s Consolidated Balance Sheets are those of PAA. Only the assets of each respective VIE can be used to settle the obligations of that individual VIE, and the creditors of each/either of those VIEs do not have recourse against the general credit of PAGP. PAGP did not provide any financial support to PAA or AAP during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022. See Note 16 for information regarding the Omnibus Agreement entered into by the Plains Entities on November 15, 2016.

Subsequent Events
Subsequent events have been evaluated through the financial statements issuance date and have been included in the following footnotes where applicable.
Note 2—
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Such estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We make significant estimates with respect to (i) estimated fair value of assets and liabilities acquired and identification of associated goodwill and intangible assets, (ii) fair value of derivatives, (iii) accruals and contingent liabilities, (iv) property and equipment, depreciation and amortization expense and asset retirement obligations, (v) impairment assessments of property and equipment, investments in unconsolidated entities and intangible assets and (vi) inventory valuations. Although we believe these estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates.
Purchases and Related Costs
Purchases and related costs include (i) the weighted average cost of crude oil and NGL sold to customers, (ii) fees incurred for storage and transportation, whether by pipeline, truck or rail and (iii) performance-related bonus costs. These costs are recognized when incurred except in the case of products sold, which are recognized at the time title transfers to our customers. Inventory exchanges under buy/sell transactions are presented net in “Purchases and related costs” in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Field Operating Costs and General and Administrative Expenses
Field operating costs consist of various field operating expenses, including payroll, compensation and benefits costs for operations personnel; fuel and power costs (including the impact of gains and losses from derivative related activities); third-party trucking transportation costs for our U.S. crude oil operations; maintenance and integrity management costs; regulatory compliance; environmental remediation; insurance; costs for usage of third-party owned pipeline, rail and storage assets; vehicle leases; and property taxes. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll, compensation and benefits costs; certain information systems and legal costs; office rent; contract and consultant costs; and audit and tax fees.
Foreign Currency Transactions/Translation
Certain of our subsidiaries use the Canadian dollar as their functional currency. Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries with a Canadian dollar functional currency are translated at period-end rates of exchange, and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing for each month. The resulting translation adjustments are made directly to a separate component of other comprehensive income, which is reflected in Partners’ Capital on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Certain of our subsidiaries also enter into transactions and have monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than the entities’ respective functional currencies. Gains and losses from the revaluation of foreign currency transactions and monetary assets and liabilities are generally included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. However, gains and losses arising from intercompany foreign currency transactions that are of a long-term investment nature are reported in the same manner as translation adjustments.
 For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the revaluation of foreign currency transactions and monetary assets and liabilities resulted in the recognition of a net gain of $
17
 million, a net loss of $
8
 million and a net loss of $
41
 million, respectively, in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

PLAINS GP HOLDINGS, L.P. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of all unrestricted demand deposits and funds invested in highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less and typically exceed federally insured limits. We periodically assess the financial condition of the institutions where these funds are held and believe that our credit risk is minimal.
In accordance with our policy, unless they may be covered by funds on deposit, outstanding checks are classified as trade accounts payable rather than negative cash. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, trade accounts payable included $
27
 million and $
26
 million, respectively, of outstanding checks that were reclassified from cash and cash equivalents.
Noncontrolling Interests
Noncontrolling interest represents the portion of assets and liabilities in a consolidated subsidiary that is owned by a third party. FASB guidance requires all entities to report noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries as a component of equity in the consolidated financial statements. See Note 11 for additional discussion regarding our noncontrolling interests.
Asset Retirement Obligations
FASB guidance establishes accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible long-lived assets, including estimates related to (i) the time of the liability recognition, (ii) initial measurement of the liability, (iii) allocation of asset retirement cost to expense, (iv) subsequent measurement of the liability and (v) financial statement disclosures. FASB guidance also requires that the cost for asset retirement should be capitalized as part of the cost of the related long-lived asset and subsequently allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method.
Some of our assets, primarily our pipelines, certain processing and fractionation facilities and terminals assets, have contractual or regulatory obligations to perform remediation and, in some instances, dismantlement and removal activities when the assets are abandoned. These obligations include varying levels of activity including disconnecting inactive assets from active assets, cleaning and purging assets, and in some cases, completely removing the assets and returning the land to its original state. These assets have been in existence for many years and with regular maintenance will continue to be in service for many years to come. It is not possible to predict when demand for these transportation, storage or other services will cease, and we do not believe that such demand will cease for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, we believe the date when these assets will be abandoned is indeterminate. With no reasonably determinable abandonment date, we cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the associated asset retirement obligations. We will record asset retirement obligations for these assets in the period in which sufficient information becomes available for us to reasonably estimate the settlement dates.
A small portion of our contractual or regulatory obligations is related to assets that are inactive or that we plan to take out of service and, although the ultimate timing and costs to settle these obligations are not known with certainty, we have recorded a reasonable estimate of these obligations.

The following table presents the change in the liability for asset retirement obligations, substantially all of which is reflected in “Other long-term liabilities and deferred credits” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 (in millions):

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Fair Value Measurements
Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, which affects the placement of assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy levels. The determination of the fair values includes not only the credit standing of the counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements (such as cash deposits and letters of credit) but also the impact of our nonperformance risk on our liabilities. The fair value of our commodity derivatives and interest rate derivatives includes adjustments for credit risk. Our credit adjustment methodology uses market observable inputs and requires judgment. There were no changes to any of our valuation techniques during the period.
 See Note 12 for further discussion.
Other Significant Accounting Policies
See the respective footnotes for our accounting policies regarding (i) revenues and accounts receivable, (ii) net income per Class A share, (iii) inventory, linefill and long-term inventory, (iv) property and equipment, (v) acquisitions, (vi) investments in unconsolidated entities, (vii) intangible assets, (viii) derivatives and risk management activities, (ix) leases, (x) income taxes, (xi) equity-indexed compensation and (xii) legal and environmental matters.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements, Disclosure Rules and Other Legislation
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, 
Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
, which requires, among other things, disclosure of specified information about certain costs and expenses in the notes to the financial statements. The guidance is effective prospectively for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027 with retrospective application and early adoption permitted. We intend to provide the required disclosures beginning with our annual report for the year ended December 31, 2027.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
, which requires, among other things, disaggregated information about effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid (net of refunds received) on an annual basis. The guidance is effective prospectively for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 with retrospective or early adoption permitted. We intend to provide the required disclosures prospectively beginning with our annual report for the year ended December 31, 2025.
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, 
which requires disaggregated disclosure of significant segment expenses and other amounts included within the reported measure of segment profit or loss for each reportable segment on an annual and interim basis. The guidance is effective retrospectively for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 with early adoption permitted. We adopted this guidance beginning with our annual report for the year ended December 31, 2024. See Note 19 for updated segment disclosures. Other than such disclosure updates, our adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
In August 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-05, 
Business Combinations—Joint Venture Formations (Subtopic 805-60): Recognition and Initial Measurement
, which requires a newly-formed joint venture to apply a new basis of accounting to its contributed net assets, resulting in the joint venture initially measuring its contributed net assets at fair value on the formation date. This guidance is effective prospectively for all joint ventures with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt this guidance for joint venture formations on or after January 1, 2025.

SEC Climate Disclosure Rules
In March 2024, the SEC adopted final rules (“climate disclosure rules”) requiring registrants to disclose, among other things, information about material climate-related risks and their impact on a registrant’s strategy, business model and outlook; information about material direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2), which are subject to assurance requirements; and the financial statement effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions. In April 2024, the SEC stayed the climate disclosure rules pending resolution of legal challenges. We are monitoring the status of the stay and the outcome of the legal challenge for the applicability of the climate disclosure rules.
International Tax Reform
Recently, several countries, including Canada, have enacted legislation to implement key aspects of the global minimum top-up tax in accordance with the Pillar Two model rules of the OECD tax framework. We continue to evaluate the new legislation, but do not currently expect a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Sales Revenues.
 Revenues from sales of crude oil and NGL are recognized at the time title to the product sold transfers to the purchaser, which occurs upon delivery of the product to the purchaser or its designee. The consideration received under these contracts is variable based on commodity prices. Inventory exchanges under buy/sell transactions are excluded from sales revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Transportation Revenues.
 Transportation revenues include revenues from transporting crude oil and NGL on pipelines and trucks. Revenues from pipeline tariffs and fees are associated with the transportation of crude oil and NGL at a published tariff. We primarily recognize pipeline tariff and fee revenues over time as services are rendered, based on the volumes transported. As is common in the pipeline transportation industry, our tariffs incorporate a loss allowance factor. We recognize the allowance volumes collected as part of the transaction price and record this non-cash consideration at fair value, measured as of the contract inception date
.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Terminalling, Storage and Other Revenues.
 Revenues in this category include (i) fees that are generated when we receive liquids from one connecting source and deliver the applicable product to another connecting carrier, (ii) fees from storage capacity agreements, (iii) fees from loading and unloading services at our terminals and (iv) fees from natural gas and condensate processing services and from NGL fractionation and isomerization service. We generate revenue through a combination of month-to-month and multi-year agreements and processing arrangements. Storage fees are typically recognized in revenue ratably over the term of the contract regardless of the actual storage capacity utilized as our performance obligation is to make available storage capacity for a period of time. Terminal fees (including throughput and loading/unloading fees) are recognized as the liquids enter or exit the terminal and are received from or delivered to the connecting carrier or third-party terminal, as applicable. We recognize loading and unloading fees when the volumes are delivered or received. Natural gas storage related activities fees were recognized in the period the natural gas moved across our header system. Fees from NGL fractionation and isomerization services and gas processing services are recognized in the period when the services are performed.
Reconciliation to Total Revenues of Reportable Segments. 
The following disclosures only include information regarding revenues associated with consolidated entities; revenues from entities accounted for by the equity method are not included.

Minimum Volume Commitments. 
We have certain agreements that require counterparties to transport or throughput a minimum volume over an agreed upon period. Some of these agreements include make-up rights if the minimum volume is not met. We record a receivable from the counterparty in the period that services are provided or when the transaction occurs, including amounts for deficiency obligations from counterparties associated with minimum volume commitments. If a counterparty has a make-up right associated with a deficiency, we defer the revenue attributable to the counterparty’s make-up right as a contract liability and subsequently recognize the revenue at the earlier of when the deficiency volume is delivered or shipped, when the make-up right expires or when it is determined that the counterparty’s ability to utilize the make-up right is remote.

Remaining Performance Obligations
. The information below includes the amount of consideration allocated to partially and wholly unsatisfied remaining performance obligations under contracts that existed as of the end of the periods and the timing of revenue recognition of those remaining performance obligations. Certain contracts meet the requirements for the presentation as remaining performance obligations. These contracts include a fixed minimum level of service, typically a set volume of service, and do not contain any variability other than expected timing within a limited range.

The following table presents the amount of consideration associated with remaining performance obligations for the population of contracts with external customers meeting the presentation requirements as of December 31, 2024 (in millions):

The presentation above does not include (i) expected revenues from legacy shippers not underpinned by minimum volume commitments, including pipelines where there are no or limited alternative pipeline transportation options, (ii) intersegment revenues and (iii) the amount of consideration associated with certain income generating contracts, which include a fixed minimum level of service, that are either not within the scope of ASC 606 or do not meet the requirements for presentation as remaining performance obligations. The following are examples of contracts that are not included in the table above because they are not within the scope of ASC 606 or do not meet the requirements for presentation:
•
Minimum volume commitments on certain of our joint venture pipeline systems; 
•
Acreage dedications;
•

•
Contracts within the scope of ASC Topic 842,

.
We have elected practical expedients to exclude the presentation of remaining performance obligations for variable consideration which relates to wholly unsatisfied performance obligations. Certain contracts do not meet the requirements for presentation of remaining performance obligations due to variability in amount of performance obligation remaining, variability in the timing of recognition or variability in consideration. Acreage dedications require us to perform future services but do not contain a minimum level of services and are therefore excluded from this presentation. Long-term merchant arrangements contain variable timing, volumes and/or consideration and are excluded from this presentation. The duration of these contracts varies across the periods presented above. 
Additionally, we have elected practical expedients to exclude contracts with terms of one year or less, and therefore exclude the presentation of remaining performance obligations for short-term transportation, storage and processing services, merchant arrangements, including the non-cancelable period of evergreen arrangements, and any other types of arrangements with terms of one year or less.

Trade Accounts Receivable and Other Receivables, Net

Our accounts receivable are primarily from purchasers and shippers of crude oil and, to a lesser extent, purchasers of NGL. These purchasers include, but are not limited to, refiners, producers, marketing and trading companies and financial institutions. The majority of our accounts receivable relate to our crude oil merchant activities that can generally be described as high volume and low margin activities, in many cases involving exchanges of crude oil volumes.
To mitigate credit risk related to our accounts receivable, we utilize a rigorous credit review process. We closely monitor market conditions and perform credit reviews of each customer to make a determination with respect to the amount, if any, of open credit to be extended to any given customer and the form and amount of financial performance assurances we require. Such financial assurances are commonly provided to us in the form of advance cash payments, standby letters of credit, credit insurance or parental guarantees. Additionally, in an effort to mitigate credit risk, a significant portion of our transactions with counterparties are settled on a net-cash basis. For a majority of these net-cash arrangements, we also enter into netting agreements (contractual agreements that allow us to offset receivables and payables with those counterparties against each other on our balance sheet).

Accounts receivable from the sale of crude oil are generally settled with counterparties on the industry settlement date, which is typically in the month following the month in which the title transfers. Otherwise, we generally invoice customers within 30 days of when the products or services were provided and generally require payment within 30 days of the invoice date. We review all outstanding accounts receivable balances on a monthly basis and record our receivables net of expected credit losses. We do not write-off accounts receivable balances until we have exhausted substantially all collection efforts.
 At December 31, 2024 and 2023, substantially all of our trade accounts receivable were less than 
30
 days past their invoice date. Our expected credit losses are immaterial. Although we consider our credit procedures to be adequate to mitigate any significant credit losses, the actual amount of current and future credit losses could vary significantly from estimated amounts.

Net Income Per Class A Share
Basic net income per Class A share is determined by dividing net income attributable to PAGP by the weighted average number of Class A shares outstanding during the period. Our Class B and Class C shares do not share in the earnings of the Partnership; accordingly, basic and diluted net income per Class B and Class C share has not been presented.
Diluted net income per Class A share is determined by dividing net income attributable to PAGP by the diluted weighted average number of Class A shares outstanding during the period. For purposes of calculating diluted net income per Class A share, both the net income attributable to PAGP and the diluted weighted average number of Class A shares outstanding consider the impact of possible future exchanges of AAP units and the associated Class B shares into our Class A shares. In addition, the calculation of the diluted weighted average number of Class A shares outstanding considers the effect of potentially dilutive awards under the Plains GP Holdings, L.P. Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “PAGP LTIP”).
Exchanges of potentially dilutive AAP units are assumed to have occurred at the beginning of the period and the incremental income attributable to PAGP resulting from the assumed exchanges is representative of the incremental income that would have been attributable to PAGP if the assumed exchanges occurred on that date. See Note 11 for information regarding exchanges of AAP units. PAGP LTIP awards that are deemed to be dilutive are reduced by a hypothetical share repurchase based on the remaining unamortized fair value, as prescribed by the treasury stock method in guidance issued by the FASB. See Note 17 for information regarding PAGP LTIP awards.
On a weighted-average basis, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the possible exchange of 
35
 million, 
44
 million and 
47
 million AAP units, respectively, would not have had a dilutive effect on basic net income per Class A share. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, our PAGP LTIP awards were dilutive; however, this did not change the presentation of diluted weighted average Class A shares outstanding or diluted net income per Class A share.

Note 5—
Inventory, Linefill and Long-term Inventory
Inventory, including long-term inventory, primarily consists of crude oil and NGL in pipelines, storage facilities and railcars that are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined using an average cost method within specific inventory pools. At the end of each reporting period, we assess the carrying value of our inventory and make any adjustments necessary to reduce the carrying value to the applicable net realizable value. Any resulting adjustments are a component of “Purchases and related costs” on our accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
No
 adjustments were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022.
Linefill in assets we own is recorded at historical cost and consists of crude oil and NGL. We classify as linefill (i) our proportionate share of barrels used to fill a pipeline that we own such that when an incremental barrel is pumped into or enters a pipeline it forces product out at another location and (ii) barrels that represent the minimum working requirements in tanks and caverns that we own. Linefill carrying amounts are reviewed for impairment in accordance with FASB guidance with respect to accounting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. Carrying amounts that are not expected to be recoverable through future cash flows are written down to estimated fair value. See Note 6 for further discussion regarding impairment of long-lived assets. During 2024, 2023 and 2022, we did not recognize any material impairments of linefill.
Minimum working inventory requirements in third-party assets and other working inventory in our assets that are needed for our commercial operations are included within specific inventory pools in inventory (a current asset) in determining the average cost of operating inventory. At the end of each period, we reclassify the inventory not expected to be liquidated within the succeeding twelve months out of “Inventory,” at the average cost of the applicable inventory pools, and into “Long-term inventory,” which is reflected as a separate line item under “Other assets” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

753

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets (Held and Used)
Long-lived assets with recorded values that are not expected to be recovered through future cash flows are written down to estimated fair value in accordance with FASB guidance with respect to the accounting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. Under this guidance, a long-lived asset is tested for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the carrying value exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset is recognized.
We periodically evaluate property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation is highly dependent on the underlying assumptions of related cash flows. The subjective assumptions used to determine the existence of an impairment in carrying value include:
•
whether there is an indication of impairment;
•
the grouping of assets;
•
the intention of “holding,” “abandoning” or “selling” an asset;
•
the forecast of undiscounted expected future cash flow over the asset’s estimated useful life; and
•
if an impairment exists, the fair value of the asset or asset group.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In addition, when we evaluate property and equipment and other long-lived assets for recoverability, it may also be necessary to review related depreciation estimates and methods.
During the fourth quarter of 2024, we recognized approximately $
140
 million of non-cash charges related to the write-down of certain of our long-lived U.S. based NGL terminal assets included in our NGL segment due to asset impairments and accelerated depreciation. Such charges are reflected in “(Gains)/losses on asset sales, asset impairments and other, net” on our Consolidated Statement of Operations. We have experienced a decrease in demand for our services at certain of our terminals within two asset groups related to changing market conditions specific to their locations, which was a triggering event that required us to assess the recoverability of carrying value of such long-lived assets. As a result of our impairment review, we wrote-off the portion of the carrying amount of these long-lived assets that exceeded their fair value. Our estimated fair value was based on the determination that a portion of the long-lived assets had no residual value. We consider such inputs to be a Level 3 input in the fair value hierarchy. Further, we determined that an acceleration of depreciation was appropriate for another portion of the long-lived assets.
We did not recognize any material asset impairments during the year ended December 31, 2023.
During the third quarter of 2022, we temporarily ceased service on a crude oil pipeline in California as a precautionary measure following a routine inspection and initiated a program of additional tests and inspections. After assessing the results of such tests and the changing operating conditions of our California assets, we determined that we had a triggering event due to the effect on future cash flows for certain of our assets that required us to assess the recoverability of our carrying value of our California crude oil assets (which includes the temporarily idled pipeline) reported in our Crude Oil segment. As a result of our impairment review, we wrote off the portion of the carrying amount of these long-lived assets that exceeded their fair value. We recognized a non-cash loss of approximately $
330
 million, which amount is reflected in “
(Gains)/losses on asset sales, asset impairments and other, net
” on our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Our estimated fair values (which we consider a Level 3 measurement in the fair value hierarchy) were based upon a discounted cash flow approach utilizing various assumptions and the application of a discount rate of approximately 
15
%, which represents our estimate of the cost of capital of a theoretical market participant for the asset group. Such assumptions included (but were not limited to) (i) future commodity volumes (consistent with historical information and estimates of future drilling and completion activity), (ii) tariff rates, (iii) estimated fixed and variable costs, (iv) the length of time the assets operate and (v) the amount for which assets in the asset group could be sold.

Acquisitions, Divestitures and Other Transactions
Acquisitions
Rattler Permian Transaction
In the third quarter of 2023, we completed a transaction with Rattler Midstream Operating LLC (“Rattler”) pursuant to which the Permian JV acquired the remaining 
43
% interest in OMOG JV Holdings LLC (“OMOG”) and certain gathering assets in the Southern Delaware basin. The transaction had an aggregate purchase price of $
294
 million ($
191
 million net to our 
65
% interest in the Permian JV). As a result of the transaction, the Permian JV now owns 
100
% of OMOG and its subsidiaries and such entities are reflected as consolidated subsidiaries in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Prior to this transaction, the Permian JV’s 
57
% interest in OMOG was accounted for as an equity method investment.
The transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed following the transaction was utilized as the consideration transferred for the purchase price allocation.
As a result of us obtaining control over OMOG, the Permian JV’s previously-held 
57
% interest in OMOG was remeasured to its fair value of $
239
 million based upon a valuation of the acquired business, as of the date of acquisition. We considered multiple factors in determining the fair value of the previously-held equity method investment, including, (i) the price negotiated with Rattler for its 
43
% interest in OMOG and (ii) a discounted cash flow approach. The discounted cash flow approach utilized a discount rate of approximately 
11
%, based on the estimate of the risk that a theoretical market participant would assign to the business. The remeasurement of the Permian JV’s investment in OMOG to fair value resulted in a gain of $
29
 million. This gain has been recognized in the line item “Gain on investments in unconsolidated entities, net” on our Consolidated Statement of Operations.

The fair value of the tangible assets is a Level 3 measurement in the fair value hierarchy and was determined using the cost approach based on costs incurred on similar recent construction projects. The fair value of the intangible assets is also a Level 3 measurement in the fair value hierarchy and was determined by applying a discounted cash flow approach. Such approach utilized discount rates varying from approximately 
21
% to 
23
%, based on our estimate of the risk that a theoretical market participant would assign to the respective intangible assets. The projection of future crude oil volumes transported and the estimated tariff rates for transportation were also key assumptions in the valuation of the intangible assets. Projected future volumes and estimated tariff rates were based on current contracts in place with assumptions for forecasted rate increases and contract renewals.
The fair value of intangible assets is comprised of customer relationships that will be amortized over their useful lives, which have a remaining weighted average life of approximately 
10
 years. The value assigned to such intangible assets will be amortized to earnings under the declining balance method of amortization. 
Amortization expense was approximately $
8
 million and $

Cactus II
In November 2022, we and Enbridge Inc. (“Enbridge”) purchased Western Midstream Partners, LP (“WES”)’s 
15
% interest in Cactus II Pipeline, LLC (“Cactus II”) for an aggregate amount of $
265
 million. Enbridge acquired 
10
% and we acquired 
5
% of Cactus II, with each paying a proportionate share ($
177
 million and $
88
 million, respectively) of the aggregate purchase price. We and Enbridge are now the sole owners of Cactus II, with 
70
% and 
30
% respective ownership interests. We will continue to serve as operator. We previously accounted for our 
65
% interest in Cactus II as an equity method investment. In addition to the change in ownership, there were changes in governance which led to a change in control. We now control Cactus II and reflect Cactus II as a consolidated subsidiary in our Consolidated Financial Statements, with Enbridge’s 
30
% interest reflected as a noncontrolling interest. 
The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination achieved in stages, or a “step acquisition”, using the acquisition method of accounting. As the majority owner and the controlling entity, we are considered the acquirer and the Cactus II predecessor business was recorded based on the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with Enbridge’s 
30
% interest in Cactus II of $
526
 million recognized as noncontrolling interest in partners’ capital.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
As a result of us obtaining control over Cactus II, our previously held 
65
% interest in Cactus II was remeasured to its fair value of $
1.140
 billion based upon a valuation of the acquired business, as of the date of acquisition. We considered multiple factors in determining the fair value of the previously held equity method investment, including, (i) the price negotiated with WES for its 
15
% interest in Cactus II and (ii) a discounted cash flow approach. The discounted cash flow approach utilized a discount rate of approximately 
14
%, based on the estimate of the risk that a theoretical market participant would assign to the business. Prior to the acquisition, we had a preexisting relationship with Cactus II, through one of our consolidated joint ventures, for certain capacity lease agreements. The portion of the fair value of Cactus II associated with these agreements is eliminated in consolidation. Accounting for such impact, the remeasurement of our investment in Cactus II to fair value resulted in a gain of $
370
 million. This gain has been recognized in the line item “Gain on investments in unconsolidated entities, net” on our Consolidated Statement of Operations.
In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the fair value of Cactus II following the acquisition is utilized as the consideration transferred for the purchase price allocation. The consideration transferred of $
1.556
 billion excludes the value associated with the capacity lease agreements described above as such value is eliminated for our Consolidated Financial Statements.
The determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was estimated in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. The analysis was performed based on estimates that are reflective of market participant assumptions.

The fair value of the tangible assets is a Level 3 measurement in the fair value hierarchy and was determined using a market approach for rights-of-way and a cost approach for other tangible assets, which were based on costs incurred on similar recent construction projects. The fair value of the intangible assets is also a Level 3 measurement in the fair value hierarchy and was determined by applying a discounted cash flow approach. Such approach utilized a discount rate of approximately 
18
%, based on our estimate of the risk that a theoretical market participant would assign to the respective intangible assets. The projection of future crude oil volumes transported and the estimated tariff rates for transportation were also key assumptions in the valuation of the intangible assets. Projected future volumes and estimated tariff rates were based on current contracts in place with assumptions for forecasted rate increases and contract renewals.
The fair value of intangible assets is comprised of customer relationships that will be amortized over their useful lives, which have a remaining weighted average life of approximately

 million was paid upon signing in December 2024. EMG Medallion 2 Holdings was a portfolio company of The Energy & Minerals Group (“EMG”), which is associated with a member of the board of directors of our general partner.
2024
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we also completed the following acquisitions:
•
the acquisition in December 2024 of the remaining 
50
% interest in Midway Pipeline LLC (“Midway”) for approximately $
90
 million. As a result of this transaction, we now own 
100
% of Midway and reflect such entity as a consolidated subsidiary in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The remeasurement of our previously-held investment in Midway to fair value resulted in a gain of approximately $
15
 million. This gain is reflected in “Gain on investments in unconsolidated entities, net” on our Consolidated Statement of Operations.
•
the acquisition of additional interests in certain unconsolidated entities, including (i) the acquisition in August 2024 of an additional approximate 
0.67
% interest in Wink to Webster Pipeline LLC (increasing our ownership interest from 
16
% to 
17
%) for $
20
 million and (ii) the acquisition in March 2024 of an additional 
10
% interest in Saddlehorn Pipeline Company, LLC (increasing our ownership interest from 
30
% to 
40
%) for $
91
 million. See Note 8 for additional information about our investments in unconsolidated entities.
•
the acquisition in the second and third quarters of 2024 of pipeline and terminal assets within our asset footprint for approximately $
32
 million.
2023
In November 2023, we acquired a crude oil gathering system in the Northern Delaware Basin from a subsidiary of  LM Energy Partners for approximately $
135
 million (approximately $
88
 million net to our 
65
% interest in the Permian JV), subject to certain adjustments. This transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition since substantially all of the value of the assets acquired was concentrated in a single asset.
2022
During the year ended December 31, 2022, we also completed the following acquisitions:
•
the acquisition in July 2022 of the remaining 
50
% interest in Advantage Pipeline Holdings LLC (“Advantage”) for $
74
 million (approximately $
48
 million net to our 
65
% interest in the Permian JV), including cash paid for working capital. As a result of this transaction, we now own 
100
% of Advantage and its subsidiaries and such entities are reflected as consolidated subsidiaries in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

•
the acquisition in October 2022 of an additional ownership interest in certain straddle plants included in our NGL segment in a non-cash transaction whereby we agreed to provide processing capacity over a 
50-year
 term at specified terms and conditions. This transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition. The fair value of the straddle plant assets acquired and liabilities assumed was approximately $
122
 million, and we recognized an equally offsetting contract liability that will be amortized on a straight-line basis into “Services revenue” over the 
50-year
 term of the agreement.
Divestitures
In February 2023, we sold our 
21
% non-operated/undivided joint interest in the Keyera Fort Saskatchewan facility to Keyera Corporation for approximately $
270
 million. As of December 31, 2022, we classified the assets related to this transaction (primarily “Property and equipment” in our NGL segment), valued at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, of approximately $
130
 million as assets held for sale on our Consolidated Balance Sheet (in “Other current assets”). Upon the sale of this facility, we recognized a gain of approximately $
140
 million which is included in “(Gains)/losses on asset sales, asset impairments and other, net” on our Consolidated Statement of Operations.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, we sold certain non-core assets for total proceeds of $
60
 million. The assets sold primarily consisted of land and related assets in Long Beach, California, as well as Line 901 and the Sisquoc to Pentland portion of Line 903. These assets were previously reported in our Crude Oil segment. We recognized gains of $
61
 million related to these asset sales, a portion of which relates to the transfer of an asset retirement obligation to the purchaser. Such amounts are included in “(Gains)/losses on asset sales, asset impairments and other, net” on our Consolidated Statement of Operations.
Note 8—
Investments in Unconsolidated Entities
Investments in entities over which we have significant influence but not control are accounted for under the equity method. We do not consolidate any part of the assets or liabilities of our equity investees. Our share of net income or loss is reflected as one line item on our Consolidated Statements of Operations entitled “Equity earnings in unconsolidated entities” and will increase or decrease, as applicable, the carrying value of our investments in unconsolidated entities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We evaluate our equity investments for impairment in accordance with FASB guidance with respect to the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock. An impairment of an equity investment results when factors indicate that the investment’s fair value is less than its carrying value and the reduction in value is other than temporary in nature.

(2)
Although we own more than 50% of Capline, we use the equity method to account for the investment because the other joint venture members still retain substantive participating rights.
(3)
Although we own less than 20% of W2W Pipeline, we use the equity method to account for the investment because we believe we have significant influence over the financial and operating decisions of the company.
Acquisitions
During 2024, we acquired the remaining 
50
% interest in Midway (which was previously presented in “Other investments” in the table above). Prior to our acquisition, our 
50
% interest in Midway was accounted for as an equity method investment. In addition, during 2024, we acquired additional interests in W2W Pipeline and Saddlehorn, which we continue to account for as equity method investments. See Note 7 for additional information regarding these transactions.
During the fourth quarter of 2022, through a non-monetary transaction, we acquired an additional interest in OMOG in exchange for the contribution of portions of 
two
 pipeline systems. After the transaction, our ownership interest in OMOG increased to 
57
% from 
40
%. Subsequent to this transaction, we continued to account for OMOG as an equity method investment because the joint venture partner still retained substantive participating rights. The transaction resulted in a loss of approximately $
25
 million, which represented the difference between the fair value and historical book value of the assets contributed. This loss was reflected in “Gain on investments in unconsolidated entities, net” on our Consolidated Statement of Operations. In the third quarter of 2023, we acquired the remaining 
43
% interest in OMOG. We now reflect OMOG and its subsidiaries as consolidated subsidiaries in our Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 7 for additional information.
In July 2022, we acquired the remaining 
50
% interest in Advantage. Prior to the acquisition, our 
50
% interest in Advantage was accounted for as an equity method investment. See Note 7 for additional information. 
In November 2022, we acquired an additional 
5
% interest in Cactus II which, combined with changes in governance, resulted in our obtaining control of the entity. We now reflect Cactus II as a consolidated subsidiary in our Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 7 for additional information.
Distributions
Distributions received from unconsolidated entities are classified based on the nature of the distribution approach, which looks to the activity that generated the distribution. We consider distributions received from unconsolidated entities as a return on investment in those entities to the extent that the distribution was generated through operating results, and therefore classify these distributions as cash flows from operating activities in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Other distributions received from unconsolidated entities are considered a return of investment and classified as cash flows from investing activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. 
Contributions
We generally fund our portion of development, construction or capital investment projects of our equity method investees through capital contributions. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we made cash contributions of $
4
 million, $
29
 million and $
13
 million, respectively, to certain of our equity method investees. We capitalize interest costs associated with contributions to unconsolidated entities for projects under development and construction. Our contributions to these entities (including capitalized interest costs) increase the carrying value of our investments and are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as cash used in investing activities.
Basis Differences
Our investments in unconsolidated entities exceeded our share of the underlying equity in the net assets of such entities by $
213
 million and $
229
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Such basis differences are included in the carrying values of our investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The portion of the basis differences attributable to depreciable or amortizable assets is amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related assets, which reduces “Equity earnings in unconsolidated entities” on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The portion of the basis differences attributable to goodwill is not amortized. The majority of the basis difference at both December 31, 2024 and 2023 was attributable to goodwill related to our ownership interest in BridgeTex with the remaining basis difference primarily related to capitalized interest incurred during construction of the assets of our unconsolidated entities.

PAA’s fixed-rate senior notes had a face value of approximately $
7.2
 billion and $
7.3
 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We estimated the aggregate fair value of these notes to be approximately $
6.7
 billion and $
6.9
 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. PAA’s fixed-rate senior notes are traded among institutions, and these trades are routinely published by a reporting service. Our determination of fair value is based on reported trading activity near the end of the reporting period. We estimate that the carrying value of outstanding borrowings under PAA’s commercial paper program approximates fair value as interest rates reflect current market rates. The fair value estimates for the PAA senior notes and commercial paper program are based upon observable market data and are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
PAA Commercial Paper Program
PAA has a commercial paper program under which it may issue (and have outstanding at any time) up to $
2.7
 billion in the aggregate of privately placed, unsecured commercial paper notes. Such notes are backstopped by the PAA senior unsecured revolving credit facility and the PAA senior secured hedged inventory facility; as such, any borrowings under the PAA commercial paper program reduce the available capacity under these facilities.
Credit Agreements
PAA senior secured hedged inventory facility
. PAA has a credit agreement that provides for a senior secured hedged inventory facility with a committed borrowing capacity of $
1.35
 billion. Subject to obtaining additional or increased lender commitments and other terms and conditions, the committed capacity of the facility may be increased to $
1.9
 billion. The credit agreement provides for the issuance of letters of credit of up to $
400
 million. Proceeds from the facility are primarily used to finance purchased or stored hedged inventory, including NYMEX and ICE margin deposits. Such obligations under the committed facility are secured by the financed inventory and the associated accounts receivable and are repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the financed inventory. Borrowings accrue interest based, at our election, on certain floating rate indices as defined in the credit agreement, in each case plus a margin based on our credit rating at the applicable time. The amended credit agreement also provides for 
one
 or more 
one-year
 extensions, subject to applicable approval and other terms and conditions. In August 2024, PAA amended the facility agreement to, among other things, extend the maturity date of the facility to August 2027 for each extending lender. The maturity date with respect to the non-extending lender (which represents a commitment of approximately $
64
 million out of total commitments of $
1.35
 billion from all lenders) remains August 2026.
PAA senior unsecured revolving credit facility.
 PAA has a credit agreement that provides for a senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a committed borrowing capacity of $
1.35
 billion, of which $
400
 million is available for the issuance of letters of credit. Subject to obtaining additional or increased lender commitments and other terms and conditions, the committed capacity may be increased to $
2.1
 billion. Borrowings accrue interest based, at our election, on certain floating rate indices as defined in the credit agreement, in each case plus a margin based on our credit rating at the applicable time. The credit agreement provides for 
one
 or more 
one-year
 extensions, subject to applicable approval and other terms and conditions. In August 2024, PAA amended the facility agreement to, among other things, extend the maturity date of the facility to August 2029 for each extending lender. The maturity date with respect to the non-extending lender (which represents a commitment of approximately $
64
 million out of total commitments of $
1.35
 billion from all lenders) remains August 2027.
PAA Senior Notes
PAA’s senior notes are co-issued, jointly and severally, by Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. and a 
100
%-owned consolidated finance subsidiary (neither of which have independent assets or operations) and are unsecured senior obligations of such entities and rank equally in right of payment with existing and future senior indebtedness of the issuers. PAA may, at its option, redeem any series of senior notes at any time in whole or from time to time in part, prior to maturity, at the redemption prices described in the indentures governing the senior notes. PAA’s senior notes are not guaranteed by any of its subsidiaries.

Covenants and Compliance
The credit agreements for PAA’s revolving credit facilities (which impact the ability to access the PAA commercial paper program because they provide the financial backstop that supports PAA’s short-term credit ratings) and the indentures governing PAA’s senior notes contain cross-default provisions. PAA’s credit agreements prohibit declaration or payments of distributions on, or purchases or redemptions of, units if any default or event of default is continuing. In addition, PAA’s agreements contain various covenants limiting PAA’s ability to, among other things:
•
grant liens on certain property;
•
incur indebtedness, including finance leases;
•
sell substantially all of its assets or enter into a merger or consolidation;
•
engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and
•
enter into certain burdensome agreements.

PLAINS GP HOLDINGS, L.P. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The credit agreements for the PAA senior unsecured revolving credit facility and senior secured hedged inventory facility treat a change of control as an event of default and also require PAA to maintain a debt-to-EBITDA coverage ratio that, on a trailing four-quarter basis, will not be greater than 
5.00
 to 1.00 (or 
5.50
 to 1.00 on all outstanding debt during an acquisition period (generally, the period consisting of three fiscal quarters following an acquisition greater than $
150
 million)). For covenant compliance purposes, Consolidated EBITDA may include certain adjustments, including those for material projects and certain non-recurring expenses. Additionally, letters of credit and borrowings to fund hedged inventory and margin requirements are excluded when calculating the debt coverage ratio.
A default under PAA’s credit agreements or indentures would permit the lenders to accelerate the maturity of the outstanding debt. As long as PAA is in compliance with the provisions contained in its credit agreements, PAA’s ability to make distributions of available cash is not restricted. As of December 31, 2024, PAA was in compliance with the covenants contained in its credit agreements and indentures.
Borrowings and Repayments
Total borrowings under PAA’s credit facilities and commercial paper program for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were approximately $
28.1
 billion, $
18.1
 billion and $
25.0
 billion, respectively. Total repayments under PAA’s credit facilities and commercial paper program were approximately $
28.1
 billion, $
17.7
 billion and $
25.0
 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The variance in total gross borrowings and repayments is impacted by various business and financial factors including, but not limited to, the timing, average term and method of general partnership borrowing activities.
Letters of Credit
In connection with our merchant activities, we provide certain suppliers with irrevocable standby letters of credit to secure our obligation for the purchase and transportation of crude oil and NGL. Our liabilities with respect to these purchase obligations are recorded in accounts payable on our balance sheet in the month the crude oil or NGL is purchased. Generally, these letters of credit are issued for periods of up to 
seventy days
 and are terminated upon completion of each transaction. Additionally, we issue letters of credit to support insurance programs, derivative transactions, including hedging-related margin obligations, and construction activities. 
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had outstanding letters of credit of $
90
 million and $
205
 million, respectively.
Debt Issuance Costs
Costs incurred in connection with the issuance of senior notes are recorded as a direct deduction from the related debt liability and are amortized using the straight-line method over the term of the related debt. Use of the straight-line method does not differ materially from the “effective interest” method of amortization.
Note 11—
Partners’ Capital and Distributions
Our Shares
Our Class A shares, Class B shares and Class C shares represent limited partner interests in us. The holders of our Class A and Class B shares are entitled to exercise the rights or privileges available to limited partners under our partnership agreement, but only holders of Class A shares are entitled to participate in our distributions. 
Our Class C shares are non-economic and provide PAA, as the sole holder of such Class C shares, the right to vote, pro rata with the holders of our Class A and Class B shares, in the election of eligible PAGP GP directors. Pursuant to the Omnibus Agreement entered into on November 15, 2016, the number of Class C shares that PAA owns will at all times equal the number of outstanding PAA common units, excluding common units held by AAP, and Series A preferred units. Thus, the Class C shares function as a “pass-through” voting mechanism through which PAA votes at the direction of and as proxy for the PAA common unitholders (other than AAP) and Series A preferred unitholders in such director elections.

Exchange and Redemption Rights
Holders of AAP units and their permitted transferees each have the right to exchange all or a portion of their AAP units for Class A shares at an exchange ratio of 
one
 Class A share for each AAP unit exchanged (referred to herein as the “Exchange Right”). This Exchange Right may be exercised only if, simultaneously therewith, an equal number of our Class B shares and general partner units (if any) are transferred by the exercising party to us. See Note 14 for information regarding the recognition of deferred tax assets associated the transfer of ownership resulting from Exchange Right exercises. 
Additionally, subject to certain limitations, a holder of AAP units (other than us) has the right (a “Redemption Right”) to cause AAP to redeem any or all of such holder’s AAP units in exchange for the distribution of an equivalent number of PAA common units held by AAP (“AAP Unit Redemption”). In connection with any AAP Unit Redemption, the redeeming holder will transfer the AAP units to AAP and a corresponding number of our Class B shares and general partner units (if any), in each case, to us. The AAP units transferred to AAP will be canceled, the Class B shares transferred to us will be canceled and any general partner units transferred to us will remain outstanding and increase our ownership percentage in our general partner. Additionally, we will issue a corresponding number of Class C shares to PAA.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
On January 7, 2025, we declared a cash distribution of $
0.38
 per outstanding Class A share. This distribution of $
75
 million was paid on February 14, 2025 to shareholders of record at the close of business on January 31, 2025, for the period October 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024.
Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss)
Other comprehensive income/(loss) attributable to our Class A shareholders is comprised solely of their proportionate share of PAA’s other comprehensive income/(loss) based on our indirect ownership interest in PAA during the period.
Consolidated Subsidiaries
Noncontrolling Interests in Subsidiaries
As of December 31, 2024, noncontrolling interests in our subsidiaries consisted of (i) limited partner interests in PAA including a 
70
% interest in PAA’s common units and PAA’s Series A preferred units combined and 
100
% of PAA’s Series B preferred units, (ii) an approximate 
15
% limited partner interest in AAP, (iii) a 
35
% interest in the Permian JV, (iv) a 
30
% interest in Cactus II and (v) a 
33
% interest in Red River Pipeline Company LLC (“Red River”). The transactions resulting in the recognition of noncontrolling interests in the Permian JV and Cactus II are described below.
In November 2022, we acquired an additional 
5
% interest in Cactus II which, combined with changes in governance, resulted in our obtaining control of the entity. We own 
70
% of Cactus II and reflect the entity as a consolidated subsidiary in our Consolidated Financial Statements, with Enbridge’s 
30
% interest accounted for as a noncontrolling interest. This transaction resulted in the recognition of partners’ capital attributable to noncontrolling interests of approximately $
526
 million. See Note 7 for more details regarding this transaction.
Common Equity Repurchase Program
In November 2020, the board of directors of our general partner approved a $
500
 million common equity repurchase program (the “Program”) to be utilized as an additional method of returning capital to investors. The Program authorizes the repurchase from time to time of up to $
500
 million of PAA common units and/or our Class A shares via open market purchases or negotiated transactions conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. No time limit has been set for completion of the Program, and the Program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The Program does not obligate PAA or us to acquire a particular number of PAA common units or Class A shares. Any PAA common units or Class A shares that are repurchased will be canceled. Class C shares held by PAA associated with any publicly held common units that are repurchased will also be canceled.
There were 
no
 repurchases under the Program during the years ended December 31, 2024 or 2023. During the years ended December 31, 2022, PAA repurchased common units under the Program through open market purchases for a total purchase price of $
74
 million, including commissions and fees. The repurchased common units were canceled immediately upon acquisition, as were the Class C shares held by PAA associated with the repurchased common units. At December 31, 2024, the remaining available capacity under the Program was $
198
 million.
PAA’s capital attributable to AAP was adjusted, in accordance with ASC 810, to reflect the accretion of its interest in PAA as a result of the repurchase of common units from public unitholders. Such adjustment is recognized by PAGP in proportion to its ownership interest in AAP, which results in a net increase in partners’ capital attributable to PAGP. See Note 14 for additional information regarding the associated impact to the deferred tax asset.

Subsidiary Distributions
PAA Series A Preferred Unit Distributions.
 After the fifth anniversary of the January 28, 2016 issuance date of PAA’s Series A preferred units, the holders of PAA’s Series A preferred units, acting by majority vote, had the option to make a one-time election to reset the Series A preferred unit distribution rate to equal the then applicable rate of ten-year U.S. Treasury Securities plus 
5.85
% (the “Preferred Distribution Rate Reset Option”). The Preferred Distribution Rate Reset Option was accounted for as an embedded derivative. See Note 12 for additional information. In January 2023, the Series A preferred unitholders elected the Preferred Distribution Rate Reset Option. Effective January 31, 2023, the new Series A preferred unit distribution rate is equal to 
9.375
% per annum of the original Issue Price (approximately $
2.46
 per unit annualized). The quarterly distribution paid in May 2023 reflected a pro-rated amount of approximately $
0.585
 per unit.
On January 31, 2025, PAA repurchased approximately 
12.7
 million units, or 
18
%, of its outstanding Series A preferred units at the issue price of $
26.25
 per unit for a purchase price of approximately $
333
 million, plus accrued and unpaid distributions through January 30, 2025 of approximately $
10
 million.

6.125
% per year of the liquidation preference per unit (equal to $
61.25
 per unit per year). From November 15, 2022 through August 14, 2023, distributions on the Series B preferred units accumulated for each distribution period at a percentage of the liquidation preference equal to the applicable three-month LIBOR plus a spread of 
4.11
% per annum. Beginning August 15, 2023, distributions on the Series B preferred units accumulate based on the applicable three-month SOFR, plus a credit spread adjustment of 
0.26161
%, plus

PAA Common Unit Distributions.
 After making distributions to its outstanding preferred units, PAA distributes the remainder of its available cash within 
45
 days following the end of each quarter to common unitholders of record, including AAP. Available cash is generally defined as all of PAA’s cash and cash equivalents on hand at the end of each quarter, less reserves established in the discretion of its general partner for future requirements. PAA’s available cash also includes cash on hand resulting from borrowings made after the end of the quarter.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 12—
Derivatives and Risk Management Activities 
We identify the risks that underlie our core business activities and use risk management strategies to mitigate those risks when we determine that there is value in doing so. We use various derivative instruments to optimize our profits while managing our exposure to commodity price risk and interest rate risk. Our commodity price risk management policies and procedures are designed to help ensure that our hedging activities address our risks by monitoring our derivative positions, as well as physical volumes, grades, locations, delivery schedules and storage capacity. Our interest rate risk management policies and procedures are designed to monitor our derivative positions and ensure that those positions are consistent with our objectives and approved strategies. Our policy is to use derivative instruments for risk management purposes and not for the purpose of speculating on changes in commodity prices or interest rates. 
When we apply hedge accounting, our policy is to formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk management objectives for undertaking the hedge. This process includes specific identification of the hedging instrument and the hedged transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the hedging instrument’s effectiveness will be assessed.

At the inception of the hedging relationship, we assess whether the derivatives employed are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of anticipated hedged transactions. Throughout the hedging relationship, retrospective and prospective hedge effectiveness is assessed on a qualitative basis.
We record all open derivatives on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.

For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value are deferred in AOCI and recognized in earnings in the periods during which the underlying hedged transactions are recognized in earnings.

Derivatives that are not designated in a hedging relationship for accounting purposes are recognized in earnings each period.

Cash settlements associated with our derivative activities are classified within the same category as the related hedged item in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Our financial derivatives, used for hedging risk, are governed through ISDA master agreements and clearing brokerage agreements. These agreements include stipulations regarding the right of set off in the event that we or our counterparty default on performance obligations. If a default were to occur, both parties have the right to net amounts payable and receivable into a single net settlement between parties.
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, none of our outstanding derivatives contained credit-risk related contingent features that would result in a material adverse impact to us upon any change in our credit ratings. Although we may be required to post margin on our exchange-traded derivatives transacted through a clearing brokerage account, as described below, we do not require our non-cleared derivative counterparties to post collateral with us.
Commodity Price Risk Hedging 
Our core business activities involve certain commodity price-related risks that we manage in various ways, including through the use of derivative instruments. Our policy is to (i) only purchase inventory for which we have a sales market, (ii) structure our sales contracts so that price fluctuations do not materially affect our operating income and (iii) not acquire and hold material physical inventory or derivatives for the purpose of speculating on commodity price changes. The material commodity-related risks inherent in our business activities are described below.
In the normal course of our operations, we purchase and sell commodities. We use derivatives to manage the associated risks and to optimize profits. As of December 31, 2024, net derivative positions related to these activities included:
•
A net long position of 
7.4
 million barrels associated with our crude oil purchases, which was unwound ratably during January 2025 to match monthly average pricing.
•
A net short time spread position of 
4.8
 million barrels, which hedges a portion of our anticipated crude oil lease gathering purchases through November 2025.
•
A net crude oil basis spread position of 
1.8
 million barrels at multiple locations through December 2025. These derivatives allow us to lock in grade and location basis differentials.
•
A net short position of 
16.7
 million barrels through December 2028 related to anticipated net sales of crude oil and NGL inventory.

We purchase natural gas for processing and operational needs. Additionally, we purchase NGL mix for fractionation and sell the resulting individual specification products (including ethane, propane, butane and condensate). In conjunction with these activities, we hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of the natural gas and the subsequent sale of the individual specification products. 
The following table summarizes our open derivative positions utilized to hedge the price risk associated with anticipated purchases and sales related to our natural gas processing and NGL fractionation activities as of December 31, 2024.

Physical commodity contracts that meet the definition of a derivative but are ineligible, or not designated, for the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. We have determined that substantially all of our physical commodity contracts qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception.
Our commodity derivatives are not designated in a hedging relationship for accounting purposes; as such, changes in the fair value are reported in earnings.

Our accounting policy is to offset derivative assets and liabilities executed with the same counterparty when a master netting arrangement exists. Accordingly, we also offset derivative assets and liabilities with amounts associated with cash margin. Our exchange-traded derivatives are transacted through clearing brokerage accounts and are subject to margin requirements as established by the respective exchange. On a daily basis, our account equity (consisting of the sum of our cash balance and the fair value of our open derivatives) is compared to our initial margin requirement resulting in the payment or return of variation margin.

Interest Rate Risk Hedging
We use interest rate derivatives to hedge the benchmark interest rate associated with interest payments occurring as a result of debt issuances. The derivative instruments we use to manage this risk consist of forward starting interest rate swaps and treasury locks. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. As such, changes in fair value are deferred in AOCI and are reclassified to interest expense as we incur the interest expense associated with the underlying debt. 
The following table summarizes the terms of our outstanding interest rate derivatives as of December 31, 2024 (notional amounts in millions):

During the year ended December 31, 2024, we terminated $
100
 million of notional interest hedging instruments previously expected to terminate in June 2024 for proceeds of $
57
 million, which was recorded in AOCI. As of December 31, 2024, there was a net loss of $
44
 million deferred in AOCI. The deferred net loss recorded in AOCI is expected to be reclassified to future earnings contemporaneously with interest expense accruals associated with underlying debt instruments. The early termination did not result in an impact to the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item. We estimate that substantially all of the remaining deferred loss will be reclassified to earnings through 2056 as the underlying hedged transactions impact earnings. A portion of these amounts is based on market prices as of December 31, 2024; thus, actual amounts to be reclassified will differ and could vary materially as a result of changes in market conditions.

Preferred Distribution Rate Reset Option

In January 2023, PAA received notice that the Series A preferred unitholders elected the Preferred Distribution Rate Reset Option. Prior to this election, the Preferred Distribution Rate Reset Option was accounted for as an embedded derivative. A derivative feature embedded in a contract that does not meet the definition of a derivative in its entirety must be bifurcated and accounted for separately if the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not clearly and closely related to those of the host contract. The Preferred Distribution Rate Reset Option embedded derivative was required to be bifurcated from the related host contract, the PAA partnership agreement, and recorded at fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair value of the Preferred Distribution Rate Reset Option, which was included in “
Other long-term liabilities and deferred credits
” on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, totaled $
189
 million at December 31, 2022. The Preferred Distribution Rate Reset Option was settled when we received notice that the Series A preferred unitholders elected the Preferred Distribution Rate Reset Option. The fair value of the Preferred Distribution Rate Reset Option on the settlement date was $
131
 million. The Preferred Distribution Rate Reset Option embedded derivative was not designated in a hedging relationship for accounting purposes and corresponding changes in fair value were recognized in “Other income/(expense), net” in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recognized a gain of $

Derivative assets and liabilities are presented above on a net basis but do not include related cash margin deposits.
Level 1
Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy includes exchange-traded commodity derivatives and over-the-counter commodity contracts such as futures and swaps. The fair value of exchange-traded commodity derivatives and over-the-counter commodity contracts is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets.
Level 2
Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy includes exchange-cleared commodity derivatives and over-the-counter commodity and interest rate derivatives that are traded in observable markets with less volume and transaction frequency than active markets. In addition, it includes certain physical commodity contracts. The fair values of these derivatives are corroborated with market observable inputs.
Level 3
Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy includes the Preferred Distribution Rate Reset Option contained in our partnership agreement which was classified as an embedded derivative. As discussed above, the Preferred Distribution Rate Reset Option was settled on January 31, 2023. The fair value of the Preferred Distribution Rate Reset Option was based on a Monte Carlo valuation model that estimated the fair value of the Series A preferred units with and without the Preferred Distribution Rate Reset Option. This model relied on assumptions for forecasts for the ten-year U.S. Treasury rate, PAA’s common unit price, and default probabilities which impacted timing estimates as to when the option would be exercised.

Leases
Lessee
We evaluate all agreements entered into or modified that convey to us the use of property or equipment for a term to determine whether the agreement is or contains a lease. Significant judgment is required when determining whether we obtain the right to direct the use of identified property or equipment. We lease certain property and equipment under noncancelable and cancelable operating and finance leases. Our operating leases primarily relate to railcars, office space, land, vehicles, and storage tanks, and our finance leases primarily relate to tractor trailers, storage tanks, land and vehicles. One of our finance leases is for storage tanks owned by an equity method investee, in which we own a 
50
% interest. For leases with an initial term of greater than 12 months, we recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability on the balance sheet. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. We have elected the non-lease component separation practical expedient for certain classes of assets where we are the lessee. Our lease agreements have remaining lease terms ranging from 
one year
 to approximately 
56
 years. When applicable, this range includes additional terms associated with leases for which we are reasonably certain to exercise the option to renew and such renewal options are recognized as part of our right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. We have renewal options for leases with terms ranging from 
one year
 to 
25
 years that are not recognized as part of our right-of-use assets or lease liabilities as we have determined we are not reasonably certain to exercise the option to renew.
Certain of our leases have variable lease payments, many of which are based on changes in market indices such as the Consumer Price Index. Our lease agreements for our tractor trailers contain residual value guarantees equal to the fair market value of the tractor trailers at the end of the lease term in the event that we elect not to purchase the asset for an amount equal to the fair value. Our lease agreements do not contain any material restrictive covenants.
For determining the present value of lease payments, we use the discount rate implicit in the lease when readily determinable; however, such rate is not readily determinable for most of our leases. For those leases for which the discount rate is not readily determinable, we utilize incremental borrowing rates that reflect collateralized borrowing with payments and terms that mirror our lease portfolio to discount the lease payments based on information available at the lease commencement date.

Lessor
We evaluate all agreements entered into or modified that convey to others the use of property or equipment for a term to determine whether the agreement is or contains a lease. Significant judgment is required when determining whether a customer obtains the right to direct the use of identified property or equipment. The underlying assets associated with these agreements are evaluated for future use beyond the lease term. We have elected the non-lease component separation practical expedient for all classes of assets where we are the lessor.
We enter into agreements to conduct activities associated with (i) providing storage services primarily for crude oil and NGL and (ii) transporting crude oil and NGL. Certain of these agreements convey counterparties the right to direct the operation of physically distinct assets. Such agreements include (i) fixed consideration, which is measured based on an available capacity during the period multiplied by the rate in the agreement, or (ii) a fixed monthly fee and variable consideration based on usage. These agreements often include options to extend or terminate the lease, with advance notice. These agreements are operating leases.

Income Taxes 
Income tax expense is estimated using the tax rate in effect or to be in effect during the relevant periods in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. To the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established. Changes in tax legislation are included in the relevant computations in the period in which such changes are effective. We review contingent tax liabilities for estimated exposures on a more likely than not standard related to our current tax positions.
Pursuant to FASB guidance related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the tax position and also the past administrative practices and precedents of the taxing authority.
 As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had not recognized any material amounts in connection with uncertainty in income taxes.

U.S. Federal and State Taxes
Although we are organized as a limited partnership, we have elected to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and are therefore subject to both U.S. federal and state income taxes.
Canadian Federal and Provincial Taxes
All of our Canadian operations are conducted by entities that are treated as corporations for Canadian tax purposes (flow through for U.S. income tax purposes) and that are subject to Canadian federal and provincial taxes. Additionally, payments of interest and dividends from our Canadian entities to other Plains entities are subject to Canadian withholding tax that is treated as income tax expense.

As a result of the exchange of the ownership interest in AAP in connection with our IPO and all subsequent exchanges, a deferred tax asset was created. These transfers of ownership were accounted for at the historical carrying basis for GAAP accounting purposes, but were recorded at the fair market value of the Class A shares at the time of exchange for U.S. federal income tax purposes. These transfers were transactions among shareholders, with the basis differences resulting in a deferred tax asset that was recorded as a component of partners’ capital. Also, other equity transactions, including the repurchase of common units by PAA, and the associated adjustment to partners’ capital attributable to PAGP resulted in a corresponding change to the deferred tax asset balance that was recorded as a component of partners’ capital. See Note 11 for additional information regarding exchanges and the repurchase of common units by PAA. The deferred tax asset is amortized to deferred income tax expense as the associated basis step-up is realized on our tax returns.
As of December 31, 2024, our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $
3,549
 million and $
953
 million, respectively. If not utilized, the state net operating losses will begin to expire in 2025 and a portion of our federal net operating losses will begin to expire in 2033. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, U.S. federal NOLs generated after 2017 will have an indefinite carryforward period but may only reduce up to 80% of taxable income in any given year. Our U.S. federal NOLs generated prior to 2018 will not be subject to the taxable income limitation and will remain subject to a 20 year carryforward period.   
Generally, tax returns for our Canadian entities are open to audit from 2018 through 2024. Our U.S. and state tax years are generally open to examination from 2021 to 2024.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
As of December 31, 2024, in reference to tax years 2012 to 2019, we had received notices of reassessment (“notices”) from the Canada Revenue Agency and the Alberta Tax and Revenue Administration (the “Canadian Tax Authorities”) related primarily to transfer pricing associated with cross-border intercompany financing transactions. These notices include assessments, including penalties and interest, associated with these transfer pricing matters totaling approximately $
177
 million (based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2024). Payment of a portion of the assessment is required in order to file a notice of objection to dispute the reassessment. Accordingly, we have remitted approximately $
97
 million (based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2024) related to the assessments, which is included in “Other long-term assets, net,” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We disagree with these notices and have contested the reassessments. We intend to vigorously defend our position, and we plan to pursue all remedies available to us to successfully resolve these matters, including administrative remedies with the Canadian Tax Authorities, and judicial remedies, if necessary. As of December 31, 2024, we believe that our tax position associated with these matters is “more likely than not” to be sustained and have not recognized any amounts for uncertainty in income taxes related to these notices.
Note 15—
Major Customers and Concentration of Credit Risk 
ExxonMobil Corporation and its subsidiaries accounted for 
30
%, 
26
% and 
20
% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. BP p.l.c. and its subsidiaries accounted for 
10
% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023. No other customers accounted for 10% or more of our revenues during any of the three years ended December 31, 2024. The majority of revenues from these customers pertain to our Crude Oil segment merchant activities, and sales to these customers occur at multiple locations. If we were to lose one or more of these customers, there is risk that we would not be able to identify and access a replacement market at a comparable margin.
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of trade receivables. Our accounts receivable are primarily from purchasers and shippers of crude oil and, to a lesser extent, purchasers of NGL. This industry concentration has the potential to impact our overall exposure to credit risk in that the customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic, industry or other conditions. We review credit exposure and financial information of our counterparties and generally require letters of credit for receivables from customers that are not considered creditworthy, unless the credit risk can otherwise be reduced.
 See Note 3 for additional discussion of our accounts receivable and our review of credit exposure.

, respectively, Class C shares. See Note 11 for additional information regarding our Class C shares.
Omnibus Agreement
The Plains Entities entered into an Omnibus Agreement on November 15, 2016, which, among other things, provides for the following:
•
our ability to issue additional Class A shares and use the net proceeds therefrom to purchase a like number of AAP units from AAP, and the corresponding ability of AAP to use the net proceeds therefrom to purchase a like number of PAA common units; and
•
our ability to lend proceeds of any future indebtedness incurred by us to AAP, and AAP’s corresponding ability to lend such proceeds to PAA, in each case on substantially the same terms as incurred by us.
Transactions with

Other Related Parties 
Our other related parties include entities in which we hold investments and account for under the equity method of accounting (see Note 8 for information regarding such entities). 
During the three years ended December 31, 2024, we recognized sales and transportation revenues, purchased petroleum products and utilized transportation and storage services from our related parties. These transactions were conducted at posted tariff rates or prices that we believe approximate market.

Note 17—
Equity-Indexed Compensation Plans
Our equity-indexed compensation plans primarily include LTIPs. Although other types of awards are contemplated under certain of the LTIPs, currently outstanding awards are limited to “phantom units,” which mature into the right to receive our Class A shares or common units of PAA (or cash equivalent) upon vesting, and “tracking units,” which, upon vesting, represent the right to receive a cash payment in an amount based upon the market value of a PAA common unit at the time of vesting. Some awards also include DERs, which, subject to applicable vesting criteria, entitle the grantee to a cash payment equal to the cash distribution paid on an outstanding Class A share or PAA common unit. The DERs terminate with the vesting or forfeiture of the underlying LTIP award.
Our LTIP awards include both liability-classified and equity-classified awards. In accordance with FASB guidance regarding share-based payments, the fair value of liability-classified LTIP awards is calculated based on the closing market price of the underlying PAGP share or PAA unit at each balance sheet date and adjusted for the present value of any distributions that are estimated to occur on the underlying shares or units over the vesting period that will not be received by the award recipients. The fair value for equity-classified awards is calculated in a similar manner on the respective grant dates. These fair values are recognized as compensation expense over the service period. We have elected to recognize forfeitures of awards when they occur. 
Our LTIP awards contain (i) time-based vesting criteria, (ii) performance conditions, (iii) market conditions or (iv) a combination of time-based vesting criteria and performance conditions. For awards with performance conditions, expense is accrued over the service period only if the performance condition is considered probable of occurring. When awards with performance conditions that were previously considered improbable become probable, we incur additional expense in the period that the probability assessment changes. This is necessary to bring the accrued obligation associated with these awards up to the level it would have been if we had been accruing for these awards since the grant date. For awards with market conditions, the probable outcomes are determined on the respective dates that the fair values are calculated, and the resulting expense is accrued over the service period.

A portion of our commitment to transport is supported by crude oil buy/sell or other agreements with third parties with commensurate quantities. Other commitments for 2025 also include amounts associated with an agreement to purchase a crude oil gathering business in the Delaware Basin for $
161
 million (approximately $
105
 million net to our 
65
% interest in the Permian JV), net of a cash deposit of approximately $
16
 million paid in December 2024. See Note 7 for additional information.
Loss Contingencies

— General
To the extent we are able to assess the likelihood of a negative outcome for a contingency, our assessments of such likelihood range from remote to probable. If we determine that a negative outcome is probable and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable, we accrue an undiscounted liability equal to the estimated amount. If a range of probable loss amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then we accrue an undiscounted liability equal to the minimum amount in the range. In addition, we estimate legal fees that we expect to incur associated with loss contingencies and accrue those costs when they are material and probable of being incurred.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
We do not record a contingent liability when the likelihood of loss is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or when the likelihood of loss is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote. For contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and the impact would be material to our consolidated financial statements, we disclose the nature of the contingency and, where feasible, an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss.
Legal Proceedings

— General
In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings, including those arising from regulatory and environmental matters. In connection with determining the probability of loss associated with such legal proceedings and whether any potential losses associated therewith are estimable, we take into account what we believe to be all relevant known facts and circumstances, and what we believe to be reasonable assumptions regarding the application of those facts and circumstances to existing agreements, laws and regulations. Although we are insured against various risks to the extent we believe it is prudent, there is no assurance that the nature and amount of such insurance will be adequate, in every case, to fully protect us from losses arising from current or future legal proceedings.
Accordingly, we can provide no assurance that the outcome of the various legal proceedings that we are currently involved in, or will become involved with in the future, will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Environmental — General 
We currently own or lease, and in the past have owned and leased, properties where hazardous liquids, including hydrocarbons, are or have been handled. These properties and the hazardous liquids or associated wastes disposed thereon may be subject to the U.S. federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended, and the U.S. federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, as well as state and Canadian federal and provincial laws and regulations. Under such laws and regulations, we could be required to remove or remediate hazardous liquids or associated wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) and to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater). Assets we have acquired or will acquire in the future may have environmental remediation liabilities for which we are not indemnified or insured. 
Although we have made significant investments in our maintenance and integrity programs, we have experienced (and likely will experience future) releases of hydrocarbon products into the environment from our pipeline, rail, storage and other facility operations. These releases can result from accidents or from unpredictable man-made or natural forces and may reach surface water bodies, groundwater aquifers or other sensitive environments. We also may discover environmental impacts from past releases that were previously unidentified. Damages and liabilities associated with any such releases from our existing or future assets could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
We record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments and/or remedial efforts are probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. Generally, our recording of these accruals coincides with our completion of a feasibility study or our commitment to a formal plan of action. We do not discount our environmental remediation liabilities to present value. We also record environmental liabilities assumed in business combinations based on the estimated fair value of the environmental obligations caused by past operations of the acquired company. We record receivables for amounts we believe are recoverable from insurance or from third parties under indemnification agreements in the period that we determine the costs are probable of recovery.
Environmental expenditures that pertain to current operations or to future revenues are expensed or capitalized consistent with our capitalization policy for property and equipment. Expenditures that result from the remediation of an existing condition caused by past operations and that do not contribute to current or future profitability are expensed.
Our estimated undiscounted reserve for environmental liabilities (excluding liabilities related to the Line 901 incident, as discussed further below) were reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows (in millions):

    The 2024 balance reflects an increase in estimated costs for long-term environmental remediation obligations.
In some cases, the actual cash expenditures associated with these liabilities may not occur for several years. Our estimates used in determining these reserves are based on information currently available to us and our assessment of the ultimate outcome. Among the many uncertainties that impact our estimates are the necessary regulatory approvals for, and potential modification of, our remediation plans, the limited amount of data available upon initial assessment of the impact of soil or water contamination, changes in costs associated with environmental remediation services and equipment and the possibility of existing or future legal claims giving rise to additional liabilities. Therefore, although we believe that the reserve is adequate, actual costs incurred (which may ultimately include costs for contingencies that are currently not reasonably estimable or costs for contingencies where the likelihood of loss is currently believed to be only reasonably possible or remote) may be in excess of the reserve and may potentially have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Specific Legal, Environmental or Regulatory Matters
Line 901 Incident
. In May 2015, we experienced a crude oil release from our Las Flores to Gaviota Pipeline (Line 901) in Santa Barbara County, California. A portion of the released crude oil reached the Pacific Ocean at Refugio State Beach through a drainage culvert. Following the release, we shut down the pipeline and initiated our emergency response plan. A Unified Command, which included the United States Coast Guard, the EPA, the State of California Department of Fish and Wildlife (“CDFW”), the California Office of Spill Prevention and Response and the Santa Barbara Office of Emergency Management, was established for the response effort. Clean-up and remediation operations with respect to impacted shoreline and other areas were determined by the Unified Command to be complete in 2016, and the Unified Command was dissolved. Our estimate of the amount of oil spilled, based on relevant facts, data and information, and as set forth in the Consent Decree described below, is approximately 
2,934
 barrels; of this amount, we estimate that 
598
 barrels reached the Pacific Ocean.
As a result of the Line 901 incident, several governmental agencies and regulators initiated investigations into the Line 901 incident, various claims have been made against us and a number of lawsuits have been filed against us, most of which have been resolved. Set forth below is a brief summary of actions and matters that are currently pending or recently resolved. 
Several pending or recently resolved lawsuits and claims were filed by companies, governmental agencies and individuals alleging damages arising out of the Line 901 incident. These lawsuits and claims generally seek restitution, compensatory and punitive damages, and/or injunctive relief. Most of these lawsuits have been settled or dismissed by the court. We recently settled the following 
two
 lawsuits (the “2024 Settlements”): (i) a lawsuit in California Superior Court in Santa Barbara County for lost revenue or profit asserted by a former oil producer that declared bankruptcy and shut in its offshore production platform following the Line 901 incident; and (ii) a lawsuit filed by the California State Land Commission in California Superior Court in Santa Barbara County seeking lost royalties following the shut-down of Line 901, as well as costs related to the decommissioning of such platform. In connection with the 2024 Settlements, we recognized additional costs related to the Line 901 incident of $
120
 million. Our remaining Line 901 lawsuits include various lawsuits filed in California Superior Court in Santa Barbara County by (x) companies and individuals who provided labor, goods, or services associated with oil production activities they claim were disrupted following the Line 901 incident and (y) a landowner on an adjacent pipeline alleging property damage from the “stigma” of the Line 901 incident. We are vigorously defending these remaining lawsuits, which have not yet been set for trial, and believe we have strong defenses. The ultimate outcome of such matters is uncertain, and an unfavorable resolution could have a material impact on our results of operations.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In November 2022, we submitted claims to several of our insurance carriers seeking reimbursement for a $
230
 million payment made in October of 2022 to settle a class action lawsuit stemming from the Line 901 incident (the “Class Action Settlement”). We had previously received payment of approximately $
3.6
 million from one insurer, which represented the final payment obligation of such insurer and brought the total amount collected from all insurers under such program to $
275
 million of the $
500
 million policy limits. In response to denials of coverage or other failures to timely tender payment, we initiated final and binding insurance arbitration proceedings against the insurers responsible for the remaining $
225
 million of coverage. Such insurers generally alleged that some or all damages encompassed by the Class Action Settlement were not covered by their policies and that all or some portion of the $
275
 million for which we had already received insurance reimbursement did not, for purposes of determining whether their policies were triggered, properly exhaust the underlying policies that paid those sums. 
As of December 31, 2023, we believed that our claim for reimbursement was probable of recovery despite the ongoing arbitration proceedings. Our belief at that time was based on: (i) our analysis of the terms of the underlying insurance policies as applied to the facts and circumstances that comprised our claim for reimbursement, (ii) our experience with the cost submissions and timely collection of claims for the $
275
 million previously collected for this incident under the same insurance program as the denied claims, including from some of the same insurers who were then denying claims, (iii) our extensive legal review and assessment of the insurer’s claimed basis for denial of coverage, which review and assessment included the advice of external legal counsel experienced in these type of matters that supported our belief that our insurers were required to provide coverage based on the terms of the policies and the nature of our claims, and (iv) the financial strength of the insurance carriers as determined by an independent credit ratings agency. However, at that time we also noted that various factors could impact the timing and amount of recovery of our insurance receivable, including future developments that adversely impacted our assessment of the strength of our coverage claims, the outcome of any dispute resolution proceedings with respect to our coverage claims (including arbitration proceedings) and the extent to which insurers may become insolvent in the future. 
A binding arbitration hearing with respect to our insurance claim against insurers representing $
175
 million of our total $
225
 million reimbursement claim concluded in early October 2024, and the arbitration panel’s final and binding decision was returned in January 2025. The panel ruled that a substantial portion of our claims subject to the proceeding were not covered under the applicable policy and therefore we were not entitled to reimbursement of our $
175
 million claim against the applicable insurers. With respect to our remaining $
50
 million claim against different insurance carriers, we now regard collection of those claims as being less than “probable.” As a result, we have written off the entire $
225
 million receivable and will recognize any future collections as and if they are received.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In connection with the foregoing, including the 2024 Settlements, we have made adjustments to our total estimated Line 901 costs and the portion of such costs that we believe are probable of recovery from insurance carriers, net of deductibles. Effective as of December 31, 2024, we estimate that the aggregate total costs we have incurred or will incur with respect to the Line 901 incident will be approximately $
870
 million, which includes actual and projected emergency response and clean-up costs, natural resource damage assessments, fines and penalties incurred, certain third-party claims settlements (including the Class Action Settlement and the 2024 Settlements), and estimated costs associated with our remaining Line 901 lawsuits and claims as described above, as well as estimates for certain legal fees and statutory interest where applicable. We accrue such estimates of aggregate total costs to “Field operating costs” in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. This estimate considers our prior experience in environmental investigation and remediation matters and available data from, and in consultation with, our environmental and other specialists, as well as currently available facts and presently enacted laws and regulations. We have made assumptions for (i) the resolution of certain third-party claims and lawsuits, but excluding claims and lawsuits with respect to which losses are not probable and reasonably estimable, and (ii) the nature, extent and cost of legal services that will be required in connection with all lawsuits, claims and other matters requiring legal or expert advice associated with the Line 901 incident. Our estimate does not include any lost revenue associated with the shutdown of Line 901 or 903 and does not include any liabilities or costs that are not reasonably estimable at this time or that relate to contingencies where we currently regard the likelihood of loss as being only reasonably possible or remote. We believe we have accrued adequate amounts for all probable and reasonably estimable costs; however, this estimate is subject to uncertainties associated with the assumptions that we have made. For example, with respect to potential losses that we regard as only reasonably possible or remote, we have made assumptions regarding the strength of our legal position based on our assessment of the relevant facts and applicable law and precedent; if our assumptions regarding such matters turn out to be inaccurate (i.e., we are found to be liable under circumstances where we regard the likelihood of loss as being only reasonably possible or remote), we could be responsible for significant costs and expenses that are not currently included in our estimates and accruals. In addition, for any potential losses that we regard as probable and for which we have accrued an estimate of the potential losses, our estimates regarding damages, legal fees, court costs and interest could turn out to be inaccurate and the actual losses we incur could be significantly higher than the amounts included in our estimates and accruals. Also, the amount of time it takes for us to resolve all of the current and future lawsuits and claims that relate to the Line 901 incident could turn out to be significantly longer than we have assumed, and as a result the costs we incur for legal services could be significantly higher than we have estimated. Accordingly, our assumptions and estimates may turn out to be inaccurate and our total costs could turn out to be materially higher; therefore, we can provide no assurance that we will not have to accrue significant additional costs in the future with respect to the Line 901 incident.
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized costs, net of amounts probable of recovery from insurance (as applicable), of $
345
 million, $
10
 million, and $
95
 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had a remaining undiscounted gross liability of approximately $
5
 million and $
94
 million, respectively, related to the Line 901 incident, which aggregate amounts are reflected in “Current liabilities” on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
As discussed above, we maintain insurance coverage, which is subject to certain exclusions and deductibles, in the event of such liabilities. As of December 31, 2023, we had  recognized a receivable of approximately $
225
 million for the portion of the release costs that we believed were probable of recovery from insurance, net of deductibles and amounts already collected (approximately $
280
 million out of the $
505
 million submitted, including the 2015 insurance program and our directors and officers (D&O) insurance policies). Of this amount, we had classified $
175
 million as a short-term asset in “Trade accounts receivable and other receivables, net” with the remaining $
50
 million recognized as a long-term asset in “Other long-term assets, net” on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2023.
Following the arbitration panel ruling discussed above, we wrote off the full $
225
 million insurance receivable in the fourth quarter of 2024. Therefore, as of December 31, 2024, we no longer have any amounts recorded as receivables related to the Line 901 incident recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
We have completed the required clean-up and remediation work as determined by the Unified Command and the Unified Command has been dissolved; however, we expect to make payments for additional legal, professional and regulatory costs during future periods. Taking into account the costs that we have included in our total estimate of costs for the Line 901 incident and considering what we regard as very strong defenses to the claims made in our remaining Line 901 lawsuits, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of such remaining lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Other Litigation Matters. 
On July 19, 2022, Hartree Natural Gas Storage, LLC (“Hartree”) filed a lawsuit under seal in the Superior Court for the State of Delaware asserting claims against PAA Natural Gas Storage, L.P. and PAA arising out of a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement relating to the 2021 sale of the Pine Prairie Energy Center natural gas storage facility to Hartree. 
We have entered into a confidential settlement agreement and anticipate that in connection with the settlement, all of Hartree’s claims will be dismissed with prejudice and without any admission of wrongdoing by Plains.
Various coastal parishes, the State of Louisiana and some of its departments have filed lawsuits in Louisiana against a number of energy companies seeking damages for coastal erosion in connection with oil and gas operations in Louisiana. One of our subsidiaries has been named in such a lawsuit filed by The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (“LADWF”). LADWF filed a lawsuit in the 24
th
 Judicial District Court of Jefferson Parish, Louisiana on October 30, 2023 against our subsidiary, Plains Pipeline, L.P., Chevron Pipe Line Company, BP Oil Pipeline Company and Arrowhead Gulf Coast Pipeline, LLC (collectively, “Defendants”), as the former and current parties to certain pipeline right of way agreements (“ROWs”) in the vicinity of the Elmer Island Wildlife Refuge. LADWF alleges that the Defendants breached the terms of the ROWs by failing to prevent erosion and seeks restoration of the Wildlife Refuge or alternatively monetary damages in an unspecified amount. Our subsidiary owned and operated a pipeline in the vicinity of the refuge from 2006 through 2016. The damages have not been quantified and are not yet reasonably estimable, but we believe the claims in the lawsuit lack merit and intend to vigorously defend this lawsuit in coordination with the other Defendants.
Note 19—
Segment Information
Our operating segments, Crude Oil and NGL, which are also our reportable segments, are organized by product as our Crude Oil and NGL businesses are generally impacted by different market fundamentals and require the use of different assets and business strategies. The Crude Oil segment includes our crude oil pipelines, crude oil storage and marine terminals and related crude oil marketing activities. The NGL segment includes our NGL pipelines, NGL storage, natural gas processing and NGL fractionation facilities and related NGL marketing activities. Our crude oil and NGL marketing activities are included in the respective reporting segments as their primary purpose is to support the utilization of our assets by entering into transactions that facilitate increased volumes handled by our assets, resulting in additional earnings for each of our segments. 
Our CODM (our Chief Executive Officer) evaluates segment performance based on measures including Segment Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below). The measure of Segment Adjusted EBITDA forms the basis of our internal financial reporting and is the primary performance measure of segment profit/(loss) used by our CODM in assessing performance and allocating resources among our operating segments. We define Segment Adjusted EBITDA as revenues and equity earnings in unconsolidated entities less (a) significant segment expenses including: (i) purchases and related costs, (ii) field operating costs and (iii) segment general and administrative expenses, plus (b) our proportionate share of the depreciation and amortization expense (including write-downs related to cancelled projects and impairments) of unconsolidated entities, further adjusted (c) for certain selected items including (i) gains and losses on derivative instruments that are related to underlying activities in another period (or the reversal of such adjustments from a prior period), gains and losses on derivatives that are either related to investing activities (such as the purchase of linefill) or purchases of long-term inventory, and inventory valuation adjustments, as applicable, (ii) long-term inventory costing adjustments, (iii) charges for obligations that are expected to be settled with the issuance of equity instruments, (iv) amounts related to deficiencies associated with minimum volume commitments, net of the applicable amounts subsequently recognized into revenue and (v) other items that our CODM believes are integral to understanding our core segment operating performance and (d) to exclude the portion of all preceding items that is attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated joint venture entities (“Segment amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated joint ventures”).
Our CODM uses Segment Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the performance of each segment, including analyzing actual results compared to budget and guidance, to assess investment opportunities and to optimize and align assets to maximize returns to stakeholders.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Segment Adjusted EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization. We look at each period’s earnings before non-cash depreciation and amortization as an important measure of segment performance. The exclusion of depreciation and amortization expense could be viewed as limiting the usefulness of Segment Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure because it does not account in current periods for the implied reduction in value of our capital assets, such as pipelines and facilities, caused by age-related decline and wear and tear. We compensate for this limitation by recognizing that depreciation and amortization are largely offset by repair and maintenance investments, which act to partially offset the aging and wear and tear in the value of our principal fixed assets. These maintenance investments are a component of field operating costs included in Segment Adjusted EBITDA or in maintenance capital, depending on the nature of the cost. Capital expenditures made to expand the existing operating and/or earnings capacity of our assets are classified as investment capital. Capital expenditures made to replace and/or refurbish partially or fully depreciated assets in order to maintain the operating and/or earnings capacity of our existing assets are classified as maintenance capital. Maintenance capital is reviewed by our CODM on a segment basis. Repair and maintenance expenditures incurred in order to maintain the day to day operation of our existing assets are charged to expense as incurred. Assets are not reviewed by our CODM on a segmented basis; therefore, such information is not presented.

(1)
Segment revenues include intersegment amounts that are eliminated in Purchases and related costs. Intersegment activities are conducted at posted tariff rates where applicable, or otherwise at rates similar to those charged to third parties or rates that we believe approximate market at the time the agreement is executed or renegotiated.
(2)
Represents adjustments utilized by our CODM in the evaluation of segment results.
(3)
Includes our proportionate share of the depreciation and amortization expense (including write-downs related to cancelled projects and impairments) of unconsolidated entities.
(4)
We use derivative instruments for risk management purposes and our related processes include specific identification of hedging instruments to an underlying hedged transaction. Although we identify an underlying transaction for each derivative instrument we enter into, there may not be an accounting hedge relationship between the instrument and the underlying transaction. In the course of evaluating our results, we identify differences in the timing of earnings from the derivative instruments and the underlying transactions and exclude the related gains and losses in determining

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Segment Adjusted EBITDA such that the earnings from the derivative instruments and the underlying transactions impact Segment Adjusted EBITDA in the same period. In addition, we exclude gains and losses on derivatives that are related to (i) investing activities, such as the purchase of linefill, and (ii) purchases of  long-term inventory.  We also exclude the impact of corresponding inventory valuation adjustments, as applicable.
(5)
We carry crude oil and NGL inventory that is comprised of minimum working inventory requirements in third-party assets and other working inventory that is needed for our commercial operations. We consider this inventory necessary to conduct our operations and we intend to carry this inventory for the foreseeable future. Therefore, we classify this inventory as long-term on our balance sheet and do not hedge the inventory with derivative instruments (similar to linefill in our own assets). We exclude the impact of changes in the average cost of the long-term inventory (that result from fluctuations in market prices) and write-downs of such inventory that result from price declines from Segment Adjusted EBITDA.
(6)
We, and certain of our equity method investees, have certain agreements that require counterparties to deliver, transport or throughput a minimum volume over an agreed upon period. Substantially all of such agreements were entered into with counterparties to economically support the return on capital expenditure necessary to construct the related asset. Some of these agreements include make-up rights if the minimum volume is not met. We record a receivable from the counterparty in the period that services are provided or when the transaction occurs, including amounts for deficiency obligations from counterparties associated with minimum volume commitments. If a counterparty has a make-up right associated with a deficiency, we defer the revenue attributable to the counterparty’s make-up right and subsequently recognize the revenue at the earlier of when the deficiency volume is delivered or shipped, when the make-up right expires or when it is determined that the counterparty’s ability to utilize the make-up right is remote. We include the impact of amounts billed to counterparties for their deficiency obligation, net of applicable amounts subsequently recognized into revenue or equity earnings, as a selected item impacting comparability. Our CODM views the inclusion of the contractually committed revenues associated with that period as meaningful to Segment Adjusted EBITDA as the related asset has been constructed, is standing ready to provide the committed service and the fixed operating costs are included in the current period results.
(7)
Our total equity-indexed compensation expense includes expense associated with awards that will be settled in PAA common units and awards that will be settled in cash. The awards that will be settled in PAA common units are included in PAA’s diluted net income per unit calculation when the applicable performance criteria have been met. We exclude compensation expense associated with these awards in determining Segment Adjusted EBITDA as the dilutive impact of the outstanding awards is included in PAA’s diluted net income per unit calculation, as applicable. The portion of compensation expense associated with awards that will be settled in cash is not excluded in determining Segment Adjusted EBITDA. See Note 17 for information regarding our equity-indexed compensation plans.
(8)
During the periods presented, there were fluctuations in the value of CAD to USD, resulting in the realization of foreign exchange gains and losses on the settlement of foreign currency transactions as well as the revaluation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency. These gains and losses are not integral to our core operating performance and were therefore excluded in determining Segment Adjusted EBITDA.
(9)
Includes costs recognized during the period related to the Line 901 incident that occurred in May 2015, net of amounts we believe are probable of recovery from insurance (as applicable). The year ended December 31, 2024 includes the write-off of a receivable for Line 901 insurance proceeds in the fourth quarter of 2024 and the impact of settlements in the third quarter of 2024. See Note 18 for additional information regarding the Line 901 incident.
(10)
Reflects amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests in the Permian JV, Cactus II (beginning November 2022) and Red River.
(11)
Investment capital and acquisition capital expenditures, including investments in unconsolidated entities.
(12)
These amounts combined represent total capital expenditures.
(13)
Includes expenses associated with the Rattler Permian Transaction in 2023. See Note 7 for additional discussion. An adjustment for these non-recurring expenses is included in the calculation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2023 as our CODM does not view such expenses as integral to understanding our core segment operating performance.
