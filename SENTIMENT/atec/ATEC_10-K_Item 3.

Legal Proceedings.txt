Item 1.	B
usiness

We are a medical technology company, headquartered in Carlsbad, California, focused on the design, development, and advancement of technology for better surgical treatment of spine disorders. By applying our unique, 100% spine focus and deep industry know-how, we aim to revolutionize spine surgery through clinical distinction. The sophisticated approaches that we create from the ground up integrate with our expanding Alpha InformatiX
™
 ("AIX") platform to objectively inform surgery and achieve the goals of spine surgery more predictably and more reproducibly. We have a comprehensive product portfolio designed to address the spine’s various pathologies and we are perpetually innovating to accomplish our vision to be the standard bearer in spine.

Total revenue was $611.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, representing an increase of $129.3 million, or 27% compared to $482.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. We believe our future success will continue to be fueled by increasing surgeon adoption of our approach-specific procedures.

Background

The year 2018 marked the beginning of a business transformation that replaced 100% of our executive team, 92% of our Board of Directors, and 96% of the remaining team with experienced professionals, infusing spine know-how throughout our organization. Efforts that year founded the ATEC Organic Innovation Machine
™
, in-house product design, development and testing capabilities that harnessed the team’s collective spine expertise to create clinical distinction.

From 2019 through 2021, we built a foundation capable of supporting the organization as we scale. We invested in new headquarters to substantially increase surgeon and sales training capacity and opened a distribution facility in Memphis, Tennessee, to ensure predictable and expedient surgical support as our footprint expands. We developed and released several key elements of our approach-based portfolio, including a comprehensive posterior fixation system and approach-specific IdentiTi
™
 porous titanium implants. We also acquired and integrated SafeOp
™
, proprietary, know-how-backed technology that integrates with our approaches to provide real-time information about both the location and the health of nerves and motor pathways intra-operatively. SafeOp became the informational foundation of the Prone TransPsoas (“PTP”) approach, which we developed and launched in 2020 to advance first-generation lateral spine surgery. We also acquired EOS
®
 imaging, technology that enables full-body, calibrated, 3D-images that integrate throughout the span of spine patient care to influence procedure planning and improve and quantify the understanding of global alignment.

From 2022 to 2024, the momentum of PTP
™
 was robust, as both lateral-experienced surgeons and surgeons new to lateral surgery adopted the approach. We applied learnings from PTP to develop and introduce the Lateral TransPsoas ("LTP") and Midline ALIF approaches. Like PTP, the approaches were built from the ground up and integrated with SafeOp, and are designed to enable single-position surgery for the most commonly treated levels in spine. We believe that our lateral franchise boasts unparalleled optionality and has the capacity to meet the clinical requirements for every pathology and surgeon preference regardless of patient position. The lateral sophistication that we have created is earning surgeons’ confidence and loyalty, and that is fueling portfolio-wide utilization of even our most conventional procedures.

In 2024, we launched EOS Insight
™
 ("Insight"), a ground-breaking software platform powered by EOS imaging, designed to elevate spine patient care from pre-operative planning to post-operative assessment. Shortly after an EOS scan, Insight automates the calculation of alignment measures, the aspect of surgical planning most crucial to

2

Table of Contents

successful long-term outcomes. Insight incorporates those measures into a surgical plan that integrates a 3D model of the patient’s spine with our interbodies, including, if necessary, patient-specific contoured rods. In the operating room, Insight measures key parameters and enables direct comparison to the pre-operative plan. Post-operatively, the standardized images that Insight generates facilitate individual case reviews and comprehensive practice assessments. Ultimately, the images and data that Insight is accumulating can inform the first predictive care in spine.

Even before we acquired EOS, the technology was highly influential among prestigious academic and deformity treatment centers worldwide. Over the last few years, our team has developed and released technologies designed specifically to treat adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) and deformity, such as procedure-specific positioners and InVictus
™
 Direct Vertebral Rotation, adaptable instrumentation that streamlines and optimizes de-rotation. Applying our unique, holistic view of procedural innovation, we integrated the approach-specific technologies with EOS and are beginning to introduce the comprehensive approaches to EOS’ AIS and deformity-centric installed base.

The application of our team’s deep spine know-how, coupled with our commitment to advancing the field of spine continues to compel surgeons and sales talent to partner with us. That adoption-driven validation has been the source of industry-leading market share expansion since our transformation commenced in 2018.

Strategy

Our vision is to be the standard bearer in spine. By creating clinically distinct procedures that improve surgical outcomes, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to earn increasing share of the U.S. spine market, becoming the partner of choice for spine surgeons, hospitals, healthcare systems, and payors.

To achieve our vision and unlock long-term value, we have, and will continue to prioritize the following three strategic initiatives:

1. Create Clinical Distinction

Clinical distinction is paramount to our value creation strategy. We are committed to continuing to invest in the development and launch of approaches and technologies intended to revolutionize spine surgery. We have developed, and continue to seek to develop, next-generation surgical approaches that advance spine care with seamlessly integrated access systems, implants, positioners, biologics and informatics that are designed to power objective decision-making and improve surgeons’ ability to meet surgical requirements.

With the expansion and adoption of our product portfolio, we continue to drive growth in surgical volume and average revenue per surgery. For the full year 2024, surgical volume grew 19% and average revenue per surgery expanded 8.0% compared to 2023. Looking forward, we intend to continue to pioneer spine innovation that improves surgical outcomes, fueling continued growth in surgical volume and revenue per surgery.

2. Compel Surgeon Adoption

By creating clinical distinction, we seek to compel surgeon adoption, another of our strategic initiatives. Central to inspiring surgeon interest in our approaches is the “ATEC Experience,” an outcomes-based educational program for visiting surgeons facilitated at our headquarters in Carlsbad, California. The program provides an interactive learning environment tailored to surgeon needs through both a peer-to-peer and subject-matter-expert approach. We leverage our state-of-the-art, 7-station cadaveric lab to enable visiting surgeons to gain deep practical experience with our procedural solutions and educate participants on our role in shaping innovation.

We believe that the surgeon relationships we create through our educational program support durable growth. The ATEC Experience drove 18% growth in our surgeon user base in 2024. Over time, we expect surgeon utilization to consistently increase as we cultivate relationships, partnering with our customers in an increasing number of surgeries and fostering training to inspire partnership in increasingly complex surgeries.

3. Elevate Distribution

We market and sell our products through a strategic network of independent sales agents and direct sales representatives. To deliver consistent, predictable growth, we have added, and intend to continue to add, clinically astute and exclusive independent sales agents and direct sales representatives to reach untapped surgeons, hospitals, and national accounts and better penetrate existing accounts and territories. We believe the opportunity to expand our strategic sales network is vast and expect to continue to compel sales professionals to sell through the clinical distinction and surgeon adoption that power our growth leadership.

With our acquisition of EOS, we aligned EOS’ U.S.-based capital sales team with our regional sales teams and leadership. The EOS sales team focuses on hospital administrators, with the benefits of leads generated by our sales team and enhanced service support.

We are in the nascent stages of building a profitable international footprint focusing on a select few economically attractive markets: Australia, New Zealand and Japan. In 2022, we partnered with surgeons to treat our first patients in Australia and New Zealand, and late in 2024, the first LTP surgery was completed in Japan. Looking forward, we intend to gradually expand our footprint in the select geographies.

Spine Anatomy and Treatment

The spine is the core of the human skeleton, providing important structural support and alignment while remaining flexible to allow movement. A column of 33 vertebrae, it protects the spinal cord and provides the main support for the body. Each bony segment of the spine is referred to as a vertebra (two or more are called vertebrae). The spine has five regions containing groups of similar bones, listed from top to bottom: seven cervical vertebrae in the neck, twelve thoracic vertebrae in the mid-back (each attached to a rib), five lumbar vertebrae in the lower back, five sacral vertebrae fused together to form one bone called the sacrum, which sits in the pelvis, and four coccygeal bones fused together that form the tailbone. At the front of each vertebra is a block of bone called the vertebral body. Vertebrae are stacked on top of each other and separated from each other through a cushioning intervertebral disc in the front, and bony joints in the back, which create the stability and mobility needed for sitting, standing, and walking. Strong muscles and bones, flexible tendons and ligaments, and sensitive nerves contribute to a healthy spine.

Pain can be caused when any of the spine’s structures is affected by strain, injury, or disease, and spine surgery seeks to alleviate that pain. While the spine has been surgically intervened upon for decades, research demonstrates that surgical outcomes in spine are generally inferior to surgical outcomes delivered by most other orthopedic specialties, particularly in terms of durability, predictability and reproducibility. Our procedural offerings are designed to treat the various spine pathologies by better achieving the three goals of surgery including: (1) decompression, (2) stabilization, and (3) alignment. We believe there is vast opportunity to create value by innovating to improve surgical outcomes in spine.

Our Procedural Solution

Our mission to improve outcomes by revolutionizing spine surgery affords a differentiated procedural investment thesis. Unlike most of our peers, we take a holistic approach to the procedures that we bring to market, investing not just in the highest dollar components of the procedure, but in each of the technologies that integrate to enhance clinical predictability and reproducibility of procedural-based approach. Our procedures seamlessly incorporate technology engendered by that thesis, including an expanding informatic ecosystem designed to automatically and objectively inform spine patient care before, during and after surgery, as well as approach-specific, ergonomic patient positioning and surgical access technology.

Our flagship approach, PTP, was designed and released in 2020 by the team that created the first-generation lateral approach for spinal fusion to directly address the known challenges that limited earlier adoption of the technique. PTP is designed to leverage the benefits achieved by lateral spinal fusion procedures, such as reduced blood loss, shorter hospital stays, and quicker recovery times and safely treats a wide range of patient pathologies.

Table of Contents

Compared to a standard lateral procedure, the PTP approach positions the patient in a prone (face down) position, allowing simultaneous access to the spine laterally (from the side) and posteriorly (from the back), all while in a position that is more familiar to surgeons and offering a more streamlined, more orthogonal approach. Single-position lateral surgery in the prone position minimizes unnecessary patient repositioning, enhances time efficiencies, provides surgeons with increased optionality, and achieves spinal alignment objectives more reproducibly.

The PTP approach is enabled through the integration of purposefully developed technologies that address the unique challenges of approaching the spine laterally while prone. One such challenge, and probably the greatest limit to earlier adoption of lateral approaches overall, is the need to safely and predictably navigate across the lumbar plexus, an essential collection of nerves, to access the lumbar spine during surgery. To address that challenge, we integrated SafeOp Advanced Neuromonitoring information into the PTP procedure. SafeOp is a proprietary technology that enables automated ElectroMyoGraphic (“EMG”), SomatoSensory Evoked Potential (“SSEP”), and Motor Evoked Potential (“MEP”) monitoring. The technology is designed to uniquely provide real-time, surgeon-directed intra-operative information about the location and the health of the patient’s nerves, spinal cord and motor pathways, enhancing the predictability and reproducibility of lateral approach outcomes.

Our Technology

Alpha InformatiX

Designed to provide actionable information that controls clinical variables in spine care, our AIX™ product platform comprises our EOS imaging system and VEA™ alignment mobile application, our SafeOp Neural InformatiX System and our navigation-enabled robotics platform ("Valence™"). While some AIX applications are commercially available, significant development is underway to integrate and interconnect these technologies and bring unprecedented functionalities to market in 2025 and beyond.

Our EOS imaging system is designed to provide unbiased, high-quality, and calibrated full-body imaging that enables a 3D model of patients’ skeletal system for diagnostic and surgical planning applications. Insight, an organically developed end-to-end spine care software platform, built around the foundation of EOS Edge™ imaging, was released in 2024. Insight allows surgeons to more effectively and efficiently assess patients’ full-body alignment, establish surgical objectives, bend patient-specific rods pre-operatively, reconcile to surgical objectives intra-operatively, and determine whether surgical objectives were met post-operatively.

Our SafeOp Neural InformatiX System was the first reflection of the AIX product platform. SafeOp is a patented technology that delivers technical advancements and automation in the EMG, SSEP, and MEP monitoring modalities during surgery. The system is designed to provide surgeons with objective, real-time, and actionable information on nerve location and nerve health via a compact, easy-to-use, tablet-based platform. By integrating SafeOp with our advanced access, implant, and fixation technologies, we offer surgeons procedural solutions designed to enhance safety, efficiency, and reproducibility.

Valence was acquired in 2023. An intra-operative system created by spine experts with deep navigation and robotics know-how, Valence development is aimed at integrating navigation and robotics into spine procedural workflow employing either a 3D imaging scan or 2D fluoroscopic images of the patient. Utilizing a small, table-mounted navigation system, a robotic arm guides instrumentation and implants to a pre-determined destination during surgery. We achieved regulatory clearance to place Invictus® screws through the system late in 2023. Further development is aimed at integrating the technology into our lateral procedures for improved surgical predictability, reduced radiation exposure and enhanced intra-operative precision.

Positioners

We have developed approach-specific patient positioning systems that integrate with our other access systems, providing for a more rigid construct and enhanced reproducibility. The PTP Patient Positioning System
™
, for example,

was developed specifically for the PTP procedure as an adjunct to the Sigma
™ 
PTP Access System. Designed to maximize the positional effects of having the patient in a prone position while streamlining operating room setup, PTP enables a single-position surgery. Key features include bi-lateral structural support to minimize patient movement, adjustable side paddle position to accommodate varying patient habitus, an integrated bed-rail system and compatibility with the Jackson frame. In addition, the system’s ultra-radiolucent carbon fiber frame is designed to help enhance fluoroscopic visibility and its coronal bending mechanism is designed to create reproducible access to L4-5 and upper lumbar regions.

Access Systems

We have differentiated surgical access instruments that are designed to maximize patient outcomes through enhanced visibility and rigidity, intuitive orthogonality, and approach-specific exposure. We offer several split-blade retractors which allow for direct, illuminated visualization and freedom of maneuverability within the operative corridor. Our retractors also provide for stable positioning by attaching directly to the surgical table. We also offer procedure-specific access systems, including our Sigma-ALIF Access System which allows for custom anterior abdominal exposure through freehand placement of dissecting blades and connection to a ringed frame. The Sigma-ALIF Access System provides an unobstructed working corridor with custom features to enable an ALIF approach in either supine or lateral decubitus.

Implants and Fixation Systems

Our portfolio of specialized spinal implants and fixation systems are designed to specifically meet the requirements of each approach. Available in varying shapes, sizes, and lordosis options, our spinal implants are made from various materials, including allograft, PEEK, and porous titanium. We offer NanoTec
™
 surface enhancements to our interbody systems to increase the surface area for cell adhesion and proliferation. Spinal alignment can be further achieved with our lordotic expandable intervertebral body fusion systems. We also offer several standalone implants designed to provide for height restoration and stabilization in one integrated solution.

Invictus is our next-generation comprehensive spinal fixation solution, designed to treat the range of pathologies, with intraoperative adaptability and surgical predictability through an open, minimally invasive, or hybrid approach.

Biologics

We have a variety of biologics designed to facilitate the process of spinal fusion. Our biologics offerings consist of several allograft (donated human tissue) options, including 3D ProFuse
™
 Osteoconductive Bioscaffold, and a family of AlphaGRAFT
®
 products. 3D ProFuse Osteoconductive Bioscaffold is highly compressible when hydrated, allowing for ease of handling and better endplate-to-endplate contact. Our AlphaGRAFT Demineralized Bone Matrix (“DBM”) consists of demineralized human tissue that is available in gel, putty, and fiber forms. AlphaGRAFT DBM Fibers combine the regenerative capacity of interconnected fibers with the maximum availability of growth factors endogenous to bone. Composed of 100% demineralized fibers, AlphaGRAFT DBM Fibers offer moldable, cohesive handling characteristics. AlphaGRAFT Cellular Bone Matrix (“CBM”) is a growth factor-enriched cellular bone matrix that exhibits the angiogenic, osteoinductive, and mitogenic growth factors necessary for bone growth. AlphaGRAFT CBM may be delivered in granular, fiber, or structural form. We also offer BioCORE
™

Products and Technologies Under Development

Internally Developed Products and Technologies

We are continuously expanding our portfolio of products and technologies to enhance clinical outcomes across multiple pathologies, applicable to any surgeon’s preferred surgical approach.

Research and Development

Our research and development team seeks to better meet the requirements of each surgical approach and design and release new products that increase our penetration of the U.S. spine market. We are focused on developing technology platforms and products that span the largest market segments addressing degenerative and deformity spine pathologies. We have transformed our development process by focusing our programs and leveraging integrated teams to reduce the time-frame from product conceptualization to market commercialization. We also collaborate with surgeon partners to design products that are intended to enhance the clinical experience, simplify surgical techniques, and reduce overall costs, while improving patient outcomes. Most of our product development efforts are fully integrated in our Carlsbad headquarters. Our resources include a technology advancement cell for rapid prototyping, a cadaveric lab, and mechanical testing laboratory.

Sales and Marketing

We market and sell our products through a sales force consisting of dedicated and non-dedicated independent sales agents and dedicated employee direct sales representatives. We employ a team of area vice presidents, sales directors, and regional business managers, who are responsible for overseeing the sales channel process in their territories. Although surgeons in the U.S. typically make the ultimate decision to use our products, we generally invoice the hospital for the products that are used and pay commissions to the sales representative, or the sales agent based on payment received from the hospital. We compensate our direct sales employees through salaries and incentive bonuses based on performance measures.

We evaluate and select our independent sales agent partners and sales employees based upon their expertise in selling spinal devices, reputation within the surgeon community, geographical coverage, and established sales network.

We market our products at various industry conferences, organized surgical training courses, and in industry trade journals and periodicals.

Surgeon Training and Education

We focus our surgeon training efforts on delivering critical technical skills needed to perform the entire spinal fusion procedure through a peer-to-peer approach for qualified surgeon customers. Well-timed surgeon education programs drive customer conversion and loyalty by focusing on delivering value through improved clinical outcomes. We devote significant resources to training and education and are committed to a culture of scientific excellence and ethics.

We believe that one of the most effective ways to introduce and build market demand for our products is by training and educating spine surgeons, independent sales agents, and direct sales representatives on the benefits and use of our products. Sales training programs are a platform for learning and organizational development, ensuring the sales force is clinically competitive and considered an essential resource to all stakeholders. We focus on cross-functional collaboration and alignment to deliver timely and relevant programs to meet surgeon and representative needs and positively impact the business.

7

Table of Contents

Our training and education programs are designed to support new product introductions to the market as well as ongoing portfolio advancement. Our resources are nimble and responsive and include field-based engagements to supplement our core curriculum. We believe this is an effective way to increase overall surgeon adoption of our new products.

We believe that surgeons, independent sales agents, and direct sales representatives will learn of the merits and distinguishing features of our products through our training and education programs, and that such exposure will increase the use and promotion of our products. We expect our focus on the entire procedure to build awareness of the breadth of our product offering. Our goal is to create a sustainable competitive advantage for our organization by providing surgeon education programs along with a comprehensive and growing sales training platform.

Manufacture and Supply

We rely on third-party suppliers for the manufacture of all our implants and instruments. Outsourcing implant manufacturing reduces our need for capital investment and reduces operational expense. Additionally, outsourcing provides expertise and capacity necessary to scale up or down based on demand. We select our suppliers to ensure that all of our products are safe, effective, adhere to all applicable regulations, are of the highest quality, and meet our supply needs. We employ a rigorous supplier assessment, qualification, and selection process targeted to suppliers that meet the requirements of the FDA, and International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”), and quality standards supported by internal policies and procedures. Our quality assurance process monitors and maintains supplier performance through qualification and periodic supplier reviews and audits.

The raw materials used in the manufacture of our non-biologic products are principally titanium, titanium alloys, stainless steel, cobalt chrome, ceramic, allograft, and PEEK. With the exception of PEEK, none of our raw material requirements is limited to any significant extent by critical supply. We are subject to the risk that Invibio, one of a limited number of PEEK suppliers, will be unable to supply PEEK in adequate amounts and in a timely manner. We believe our supplier relationships, alternative product offerings, vendor-managed inventory, and quality processes will support our potential capacity needs for the foreseeable future.

With respect to biologics products, we are FDA-registered and licensed in the states of California, New York, and Florida, the only states that currently require licenses. Our facility and the facilities of the third-party suppliers we use are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by regulatory authorities and may undergo compliance inspections conducted by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign agencies. Because our biologics products are processed from human tissue, maintaining a steady supply can sometimes be challenging. We have not experienced significant difficulty in locating and obtaining the materials necessary to fulfill our production requirements and we have not experienced a meaningful disruption to sales orders.

Competition

Although we believe that our current broad product portfolio and development pipeline is differentiated and has numerous competitive advantages, the spinal implant industry is highly competitive, subject to rapid technological change, and significantly affected by new product introductions. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include:

•
improved outcomes for spine pathology procedures;

•
ease of use, quality, and reliability of product portfolio;

•
effective and efficient sales, marketing, and distribution;

•
quality service and an educated and knowledgeable sales network;

•
technical leadership and superiority;

•
surgeon services, such as training and education;

8

Table of Contents

•
responsiveness to the needs of surgeons;

•
acceptance by spine surgeons;

•
product price and qualification for reimbursement; and

•
speed to market.

Both our currently marketed products and any future products we commercialize are subject to fierce competition. We believe that our most significant competitors are Medtronic (Sofamor Danek), Johnson & Johnson (DePuy Spine), Stryker, Globus Medical, and others, many of which have substantially greater financial resources than we do. In addition, these companies may have more established distribution networks, entrenched relationships with physicians and greater experience in developing, launching, marketing, distributing, and selling spinal implant products.

Some of our competitors also provide non-operative therapies for spine disorder conditions. While these non-operative treatments are considered to be an alternative to surgery, surgery is typically performed in the event that non-operative treatments are unsuccessful. We believe that, to date, these non-operative treatments have not caused a significant reduction in the demand for surgical treatment of spinal disorders.

Intellectual Property

We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, nondisclosure agreements, proprietary information ownership agreements, and other measures to protect our intellectual property rights. We believe that in order to have a competitive advantage, we must develop, maintain, and enforce the proprietary aspects of our technologies. We require our employees, consultants, co-developers, sales agents and advisors to execute agreements governing the ownership of proprietary information and use and disclosure of confidential information in connection with their relationship with us. In general, these agreements require these individuals and entities to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions that were conceived on our behalf, or which relate to our property or business and to keep our confidential information confidential and only use such confidential information in connection with our business.

Patents
. As of December 31, 2024, we and our affiliates owned or exclusively licensed 180 issued U.S. patents, 45 pending U.S. patent applications and 250 issued or pending foreign patents. We own multiple patents relating to unique aspects and improvements for several of our products. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of filing or grant and legal term of patents in various countries where a patent is issued. We do not believe that the expiration of any single patent is likely to significantly affect our intellectual property position.

Trademarks. 
As of December 31, 2024, we and our affiliates owned 33 registered U.S. trademarks and 27 registered trademarks outside of the U.S.

Government Regulation

Our products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other U.S. federal and state regulatory bodies and comparable authorities in other countries. Our products are also subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), and in the case of our tissue products, also under the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”). To ensure that our products are safe and effective for their intended use, the FDA regulates, among other things, the following activities that we or our partners perform and will continue to perform:

•

Government Regulation—Medical Devices

FDA’s Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements. 
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we intend to commercially distribute in the U.S. will require either FDA clearance of a premarket notification requesting permission for commercial distribution under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, also referred to as a 510(k) clearance, or approval of a premarket approval application (“PMA”). The information that must be submitted to the FDA in order to obtain clearance or approval to market a new medical device varies depending on how the medical device is classified by the FDA. Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes - Class I, Class II or Class III - depending on the degree of risk associated with the use of the device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory controls deemed to be necessary by the FDA to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness.

Class I devices are those with the lowest risk to the patient for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to a set of regulations, referred to as General Controls, which require compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (“QSR”), facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse events and malfunctions, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling and promotional materials. Some Class I devices also require 510(k) clearance by the FDA, though most Class I devices are exempt from the premarket notification requirements. Class II devices are those that are subject to the General Controls, as well as Special Controls, which can include performance standards, product-specific guidance documents and post-market surveillance. Manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA. Class III devices include devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk such as life-supporting or life-sustaining devices, or implantable devices, in addition to those deemed not substantially equivalent following the 510(k) process. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be reasonably assured solely by compliance with the General Controls and Special Controls described above. Therefore, these devices must be the subject of an approved PMA. Both 510(k)s and PMAs are subject to the payment of user fees at the time of submission for FDA review.

If the FDA determines that the device is not “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device following submission and review of a 510(k) premarket notification, or if the manufacturer is unable to identify an appropriate predicate device and the new device or new use of the device presents a moderate or low risk, the device sponsor may either pursue a PMA or seek reclassification of the device through the de novo process. Our current products on the market in the U.S. include Class II spinal implants, instruments, neuromonitoring systems, robotic navigation systems, x-ray imaging systems and software as a medical device (SaMD) marketed under 510(k) premarket clearance, as well as Class I 510(k) exempt spinal instruments and devices.

510(k) Clearance Pathway
. To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a device legally marketed in the U.S. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval, i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. To be “substantially equivalent,” the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data is sometimes required to support substantial equivalence.

The FDA’s goal is to review and act on each 510(k) within 90 days of submission, but on average the process usually takes approximately six months. It may take less time depending on the type of device and it may take longer if the FDA requests additional information. Most 510(k)s do not require supporting data from clinical trials, but the FDA may request such data. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device.

After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, require premarket approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires the submission of a 510(k) or PMA, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA is obtained. If the FDA requires us to seek a new 510(k) clearance or PMA for any modifications to a previously cleared product, we may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until we obtain this clearance or approval. Also, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant fines or penalties. We have made and plan to continue to make enhancements to our products for which we have not submitted 510(k)s or PMAs, and we will consider on a case-by-case basis whether a new 510(k) or PMA is necessary.

The FDA began to consider proposals to reform its 510(k) premarketing clearance process in 2011, and such proposals could include increased requirements for clinical data and a longer review period. Specifically, in response to industry and healthcare provider concerns regarding the predictability, consistency and rigor of the 510(k) regulatory pathway, the FDA initiated an evaluation of the 510(k) program, and as part of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, Congress reauthorized the Medical Device User Fee Amendments with various FDA performance goal commitments and enacted several “Medical Device Regulatory Improvements” and miscellaneous reforms, which are further intended to clarify and improve medical device regulation both pre- and post-clearance and approval. Further, in December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act (“Cures Act”) was signed into law. The Cures Act, among other things, is intended to modernize the regulation of devices and spur innovation but its ultimate implementation is unclear.

Premarket Approval Pathway. 
Class III devices require PMA before they can be marketed, although some pre-amendment Class III devices for which the FDA has not yet required a PMA are cleared through the 510(k) process. The PMA process is generally more complex, costly and time consuming than the 510(k) process. A PMA must be supported by extensive data including, but not limited to, extensive technical information regarding device design and development, preclinical and clinical trials, manufacturing, and labeling information to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. The PMA application must provide valid scientific evidence that demonstrates to the FDA’s satisfaction reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. Following receipt of a PMA, the FDA determines whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If the FDA accepts the application for review, it has 180 days under the FDCA to complete its review of the PMA, although in practice, the FDA’s review often takes significantly longer. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided, and the FDA may issue a major deficiency letter to the applicant, requesting the applicant’s response to deficiencies communicated by the FDA. Also, during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panel’s recommendation. In addition, the FDA will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with QSR. The PMA process can be expensive, uncertain, and lengthy, and a number of devices for which FDA approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved by the FDA for marketing.

Clinical Trials. 
Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA and are sometimes required for a 510(k). All clinical investigations of investigational devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption (“IDE”), regulations which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting, and monitoring 
responsibilities
 of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device is determined to present a “significant risk” to human health, the manufacturer may not begin a clinical trial until it submits an IDE application to the FDA and obtains approval of the IDE from the FDA. The IDE must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. In addition, the study must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board (“IRB”), for each clinical site. The IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the IDE and may pose additional requirements for the conduct of the study. If an IDE application is approved by the FDA and one or more IRBs, human clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients, as approved by the FDA. If the device presents a non-significant risk to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the trial by one or more IRBs without separate approval from the FDA, but must still follow abbreviated IDE requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and labeling and record-keeping requirements. A clinical trial may be suspended by FDA, the sponsor, or an IRB at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to the study participants outweigh the benefits of participation in the trial. Even if a clinical trial is completed, the results may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a device to the satisfaction of the FDA or may be equivocal or otherwise not be sufficient to obtain approval of a device. We are not currently undertaking any FDA IDE trials, as all of our existing products are FDA-cleared through the 510(k) pathway. It is possible, however, that future device development may require IDE clinical trial for approval.

Pervasive and Continuing FDA Regulation.
 After a device is placed on the market, numerous FDA and other regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:

•
registration and listing requirements, which require manufacturers to register all manufacturing facilities and list all medical devices placed into commercial distribution;

•
the QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party contract manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, supplier/contractor selection, documentation, record maintenance and other quality assurance controls, during all aspects of the manufacturing process and to maintain and investigate complaints;

•
labeling regulations and unique device identification requirements;

•
advertising and promotion requirements;

12

Table of Contents

•
restrictions on sale, distribution, or use of a device;

•
FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved (“off-label”) uses;

•
medical device reporting obligations, which require that manufacturers submit reports to the FDA of device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur;

•
medical device correction and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;

•
device tracking requirements; and

•
other post-market surveillance requirements, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.

Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following:

•
warning letters and untitled letters;

•
fines, injunctions, consent decrees, and civil penalties;

•
recalls, withdrawals, administrative detention, or seizure of products;

•
operating restrictions, partial suspension, or total shutdown of production;

•
withdrawals of 510(k) clearances or PMAs that have already been granted;

•
refusal to grant 510(k) clearance or PMAs of new products; and/or

•
criminal prosecution.

Our facilities, records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA to evaluate compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.

Regulation of Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-based Products. 
Certain products are regulated as human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (“HCT/Ps”). Section 361 of the PHSA authorizes the FDA to issue regulations to prevent the introduction, transmission or spread of communicable disease. HCT/Ps regulated as “361” HCT/Ps are subject to requirements relating to registering facilities and listing products with the FDA, screening and testing for tissue donor eligibility, or Good Tissue Practice, when processing, storing, labeling, and distributing HCT/Ps, including required labeling information, stringent record keeping, and adverse event reporting, among other applicable requirements and laws. If the HCT/P is minimally manipulated, is intended for homologous use only and meets other requirements, the HCT/P will not require 510(k) clearance, PMA, a Biologics License Application, or other premarket authorization from the FDA before marketing.

Environmental Matters

Our facilities and operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, air emissions; wastewater discharges; the generation, storage, handling, use and transportation of hazardous materials; the handling and disposal of hazardous wastes; the cleanup of contamination; and the health and safety of our employees. Under such laws and regulations, we are required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for some of our operations. If we violate or fail to comply with these laws, regulations or permits, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. We could also be held responsible for costs and damages arising from any contamination at our past or present facilities or at third-party waste disposal sites. We cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from hazardous materials, and we may incur material liability as a result of any contamination or injury.

Compliance with Certain Applicable Statutes

We are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, criminal health care fraud laws, physician payment transparency laws, data privacy and security laws, and foreign corrupt practice laws. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, fines, imprisonment and, within the U.S., exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration health programs. These laws are administered by, among others, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services and state attorneys general. Many of these agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical device manufacturers in recent years.

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for or recommending a good or service, for which payment may be made in whole or part under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. For example, the definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. In addition, among other things, the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively referred to as “ACA”), amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Pursuant to the ACA, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it. Furthermore, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act.

In implementing the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (“OIG”), has issued a series of regulations, known as the safe harbors, which began in July 1991. These safe harbors set forth provisions that, in circumstances where all the applicable requirements are met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy all requirements of an applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities such as the OIG. Penalties for violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Many states have anti-kickback laws that are similar to the federal law, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, and may also result in penalties, fines, sanctions for violations, and exclusions from state or commercial programs.

We have entered into various agreements with certain surgeons that perform services for us, including some who make clinical decisions to use our products. Some of our referring surgeons own our stock, which they may have received from us as consideration for product development services performed. We frequently review these arrangements to determine whether they are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, physician-owned distribution companies (“PODs”) have become decreasingly involved in the sale and distribution of medical devices, including products for the surgical treatment of spine disorders. In many cases, these distribution companies enter into arrangements with hospitals that bill Medicare or Medicaid for the furnishing of medical services, and the physician-owners are among the physicians who refer patients to the hospitals for surgery. On March 26, 2013, the OIG issued a Special Fraud Alert entitled “Physician-Owned Entities, in which the OIG concluded, among other things, that PODs are “inherently suspect under the anti-kickback statute” and that PODs present “substantial fraud and abuse risk and pose dangers of patient safety.” Since 2013, the OIG has further increased its scrutiny of PODs and the Department of Justice has brought several high-profile cases against physician owners.

The federal False Claims Act prohibits persons from knowingly filing or causing to be filed a false or fraudulent claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from, the federal government. Private suits filed under the False Claims Act, known as qui tam actions, can be brought by individuals on behalf of the government. These individuals, sometimes known as “relators” or, more commonly, as “whistleblowers,” may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. The number of filings of qui tam actions has increased significantly in recent years, causing more healthcare companies to have to defend a False Claim Act action. If an entity is determined to have violated the federal False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties of between $13,000 and $30,000 for each separate false claim and may be subject to exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal healthcare programs. Various states have also enacted similar laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) created two new federal crimes: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. The ACA changed the intent requirement of the healthcare fraud statute to such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal healthcare programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in similar sanctions.

ACA also includes various provisions designed to significantly strengthen fraud and abuse enforcement in addition to those changes discussed above. Among these additional provisions include increased funding for enforcement efforts and new “sunshine” provisions to require us to report and disclose to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), any payment or “transfer of value” made or distributed to physicians or teaching hospitals. These sunshine provisions also require certain group purchasing organizations, including physician-owned distributors, to disclose physician ownership information to CMS. We and other device manufacturers are required to collect and annually report specific data on payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals. There are various state laws and initiatives that require device manufacturers to disclose to the appropriate regulatory agency certain payments or other transfers of value made to physicians, and in certain cases prohibit some forms of these payments, with the risk of fines for any violation of such requirements.

HIPAA also includes privacy and security provisions designed to regulate the use and disclosure of “protected health information” (“PHI”), which is health information that identifies a patient and that is held by a health care provider, a health plan or health care clearinghouse. We are not directly regulated by HIPAA, but our ability to access PHI for purposes such as marketing, product development, clinical research or other uses is controlled by HIPAA and restrictions placed on health care providers and other covered entities. HIPAA was amended in 2009 by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) which strengthened the rule, increased penalties for violations, and added a requirement for the disclosure of breaches to affected individuals, the government, and in some cases the media. We must carefully structure any transaction involving PHI to avoid violation of HIPAA and HITECH requirements.

Almost all states have adopted data security laws protecting personal information including social security numbers, state issued identification numbers, credit card or financial account information coupled with individuals’ names or initials. We must comply with all applicable state data security laws, even though they vary extensively, and must ensure that any breaches or accidental disclosures of personal information are promptly reported to affected individuals and responsible government entities. We must also ensure that we maintain compliant, written information security programs or run the risk of civil or even criminal sanctions for non-compliance as well as reputational harm for publicly reported breaches or violations.

If any of our operations are found to have violated or be in violation of any of the laws described above and other applicable state and federal fraud and abuse laws, we may be subject to penalties, among them being civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.

Third-Party Reimbursement

In the U.S., healthcare providers generally rely on third-party payors, principally private insurers, and governmental payors such as Medicare and Medicaid, to cover and pay for all or part of the cost of a spine surgery in which our medical devices are used. We expect that sales volumes and prices of our products will depend in large part on the continued availability of reimbursement from such third-party payors. These third-party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not medically necessary in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods, as determined by the third-party payor, or was used for an unapproved indication. Particularly in the U.S., third-party payors continue to carefully review, and increasingly challenge, the prices charged for procedures and medical products. Medicare coverage and reimbursement policies are developed by CMS, the federal agency responsible for administering the Medicare program, and its contractors. CMS establishes these Medicare policies for medical products and procedures and such policies are periodically reviewed and updated. While private payors vary in their coverage and payment policies, the Medicare program is viewed as a benchmark. Medicare payment rates for the same or similar procedures vary due to geographic location, nature of the facility in which the procedure is performed (i.e., teaching or community hospital) and other factors. We cannot provide assurance that government or private third-party payors will cover and provide adequate payment for the procedures in which our products are used. ACA and other reform proposals contain significant changes regarding Medicare, Medicaid, and other third-party payors.

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include the Budget Control Act of 2011, which resulted in reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken, as well as, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals and imaging centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. An expansion in government’s role in the U.S. healthcare industry may lower reimbursements for procedures using our products, reduce medical procedure volumes, and adversely affect our business and results of operations, possibly materially.

We believe that the overall escalating cost of medical products and services has led to, and will continue to lead to, increased pressures on the healthcare industry to reduce the costs of products and services. We cannot assure that government or private third-party payors will cover and provide adequate payment for the procedures using our products. In addition, it is possible that future legislation, regulation, or reimbursement policies of third-party payors will adversely affect the demand for procedures using our products or our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis. The unavailability or inadequacy of third-party payor coverage or reimbursement could have a significant adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Human Capital

As of December 31, 2024, we had 867 employees worldwide. Approximately 681 employees were located in the U.S. and 186 employees were located outside of the U.S. Of our U.S. employees, 408 were based in our Carlsbad, California headquarters, covering all of the following functional areas: sales, customer service, marketing, clinical education, advanced manufacturing, quality assurance, regulatory affairs, research and development, human resources, finance, legal, information technology, and administration.

Our workforce is highly educated and diverse, which we believe is important for our continued success as a leading innovator in the medical device market. We employ a number of strategies to best enable us to attract, retain, and engage our team members. To build a steady and diverse pipeline of talent, we have a robust recruiting program, which is focused on attracting and retaining the talent we believe is necessary to help achieve our strategy and mission. Further, we employ recruiting processes that mitigate unconscious biases and promote diverse candidate pools. Our employee base is comprised of men, women, underrepresented individuals, individuals with disabilities, and protected veterans.

Table of Contents

To attract and retain employees, we offer competitive, performance-based compensation and benefits, opportunities for discounted equity ownership, employee recognition programs, career development opportunities, and access to continual growth through in-house live trainings, as well as support and reimbursement for external trainings and educational programs. In addition, to further expand employee enrichment and engagement, we periodically survey our employees regarding their satisfaction levels. We use these survey results to determine how we can continue to create work environments that energize our employees and enable them to develop and maintain a positive working culture. We completed a survey in December 2024, in which over 92% of respondents indicated a willingness to recommend the Company to friends and family as a desirable place to work. High employee satisfaction is also reflected in our high employee engagement and low undesired turnover, which was approximately 5% for 2024.

We have never experienced a work stoppage due to labor difficulties, and believe that our relations with our employees are good. We currently have no employees working under collective bargaining agreements.

Health and Wellness

We offer various health and wellness programs to promote a healthy and active lifestyle for our employees. In addition to our health and wellness program offerings, our corporate headquarters includes indoor and outdoor workout spaces, which our employees are able to access throughout the day, as well as various fitness and workout classes. We have provided health and wellness initiatives throughout the year to promote the continued wellbeing of our employees, as well as opportunities for our employees to participate in community volunteer and clean-up programs to foster camaraderie within our employee base.

Item 1A.	Ri
sk Factors

Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks faced by the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently deem immaterial may become important factors that affect us. If any of such risks or the risks described below occur, either alone or taken together occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose some or all of your investment.

Risks Related to Our Business and Industry

Our business plan relies on certain assumptions pertaining to the market for our products that, if incorrect, may adversely affect our growth and profitability.

We allocate resources based on assumptions about trends in the development of and treatment for spine disorders and the resulting demand for our products. Our assumptions may not be accurate. Increasing awareness and use of non-invasive treatments and other shifts in technologies and treatments, emergence of new materials and acceptance of emerging technologies and procedures could adversely affect demand for our products. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect or if alternative treatments to those we offer gain further acceptance, then demand for our products could be significantly less than we anticipate and we may not be able to achieve or sustain growth or profitability.

We operate in a highly competitive market segment, face competition from large, well-established medical device companies with significant resources, and may not be able to compete effectively.

The market in which we operate is highly competitive, subject to rapid technological change and affected by new products and market activities of industry participants. Our competitors include numerous large and well-capitalized companies such as Medtronic Sofamor Danek, a subsidiary of Medtronic; Depuy Spine, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson; Stryker; Zimmer Biomet; and Globus Medical. Several of our competitors enjoy competitive advantages over us, including:

•
more established relationships with healthcare providers, distribution networks and healthcare payers;

•
broader product offerings and intellectual property portfolios, better name recognition, and more recognizable product trademarks;

•
greater resources for product research and development, clinical data, patent litigation, and launching, marketing, distributing and selling our products; and

•
greater experience in obtaining and maintaining FDA and other regulatory clearances or approvals for products and product enhancements.

In addition, at any time our current competitors or new industry participants may develop alternative treatments, products or procedures for the treatment of spine disorders that compete directly or indirectly with our products, including ones that may be superior to our spine surgery products. For these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our existing or potential competitors. Any such failure could lead us to further modify our strategy, lower our prices, increase our sales commissions and could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

A significant percentage of our revenues are derived from sales of our systems that include polyaxial pedicle screws.

Net sales of our systems that include polyaxial pedicle screws represented approximately 40% and 41% our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and are expected to continue to be significant in the future. A decline in sales of these systems for any reason would have a significant adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We rely on third-party licenses related to our polyaxial pedicle screw systems in order to use various proprietary technologies that are material to these systems, including the enforceability of the intellectual property rights in such technologies. Certain of our licenses may be terminated upon specific conditions. Our rights under each of the licenses are subject to our continued compliance with the terms of the license, including certain diligence, disclosure and confidentiality obligations and the payment of royalties and other fees. Because of the complexity of our product and the patents we have licensed, determining the scope of the license and

18

Table of Contents

related obligations can be difficult and can lead to disputes between us and the licensor. An unfavorable resolution of such a dispute could lead to an increase in the royalties payable pursuant to the license or termination of the license. Any action that would prevent us from manufacturing, marketing and selling these systems or increase the costs associated with these systems would have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our reliance on sales agents could affect our ability to market our products efficiently and profitably.

The development of a large distribution network may be expensive and time consuming. Because of the intense competition for their services, we may be unable to recruit or retain qualified independent sales agents. Like us, some of our competitors enter into exclusive distribution agreements. Further, we may not be able to enter into agreements with independent sales agents on commercially reasonable terms. Even if we do enter into agreements with new independent sales agents, it may take 90 to 120 days or even longer for new sales agents to reach full operational effectiveness. Some sales agents may not generate revenue as quickly as we expect, may not commit the necessary resources to effectively market and sell our products and may not ultimately be successful in selling our products. Our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected if we do not attract and retain new sales agents or if the marketing and sales efforts of our sales agents are unsuccessful.

To be commercially successful, we must convince the spine surgeon community that our products are an attractive alternative to competitive products.

In order for us to sell our products, spine surgeons must be convinced that our products are superior to competing products. Acceptance of our products depends on educating the spine surgeon community as to the distinctive characteristics, perceived benefits, safety and cost-effectiveness of our products compared to competitive products and on training spine surgeons in the proper application of our products. If we are not successful in convincing the spine surgeon community of the merit of our products, our sales will decline, and we will be unable to increase or achieve and sustain growth or profitability. Additionally, if surgeons are not properly trained, they may misuse or ineffectively use our products, which may result in unsatisfactory patient outcomes, patient injury, negative publicity or lawsuits against us, any of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We rely on a limited number of third parties to manufacture and supply our products. Any problems experienced by these manufacturers could result in a delay or interruption in the supply of our products until such manufacturer cures the problem or until we locate and qualify an alternative source of supply.

We rely on third party manufacturers of our implants, instruments, imaging equipment and spare parts. We currently rely on a limited number of third parties and any prolonged disruption in the operations of our third-party suppliers could have a negative impact on our ability to supply products to customers. We may suffer losses as a result of business interruptions that exceed coverage under our manufacturer’s insurance policies. Other events beyond our control could also disrupt our product development and commercialization efforts until such events can be resolved or we can put in place third-party contract manufacturers to assume this manufacturing role. In addition, if we are required to change manufacturers for any reason, we will be required to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations and guidelines. Delays associated with the verification of a new manufacturer or the re-verification of an existing manufacturer could negatively affect our ability to develop products or supply products to customers in a timely manner. Any disruption in the manufacture of our products by our third-party suppliers could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We depend on third-party suppliers, and in one case a single supplier, for key raw materials and the loss of any of these third-party suppliers, or their inability to supply us with adequate raw materials, could harm our business.

We rely on a number of suppliers and in one case on a single source vendor, Invibio, to provide the raw materials used in the production of our products. We have a supply agreement with Invibio, pursuant to which it supplies us with PEEK, a biocompatible plastic that we use in some of our spacers. Invibio is one of a limited number of companies approved to distribute PEEK in the U.S. for use in implantable devices. We depend on a limited number of sources of human tissue for use in our biologics products. Our supply of human tissue from our current suppliers and our current inventory of biologics products may not be available at current levels or may not be sufficient to meet our needs. Our dependence on a single third-party PEEK supplier and the challenges we may face in obtaining adequate supplies of biologics products involve several risks, including limited control over pricing, availability, quality and delivery

schedules. Any supply interruption in a limited or sole sourced component or raw material could materially harm our ability to source manufactured products until a new source of supply could be found. We may be unable to find a sufficient alternative supply channel in a reasonable time period or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, which would have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

If we or our suppliers fail to comply with applicable regulations, the manufacture of our products could be delayed.

We and our suppliers are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies both inside and outside of the U.S. The FDA, and other regulatory agencies, audit compliance with some of these regulations. If significant non-compliance issues arise or if a corrective action plan is not sufficient, the manufacture or sale of our products may be limited until such problems are corrected to the regulatory body’s satisfaction, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, our products could be subject to recall if the regulatory body determines, for any reason, that our products are not safe or effective. Any recall or additional regulatory approval or clearance requirements could result in delays, costs associated with modification of a product, loss of revenue and potential operating restrictions imposed by the regulatory body, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Demand for our products, and prices at which customers and patients are willing to pay for our products depend upon the ability of our customers to obtain adequate third-party coverage and reimbursement product purchases.

Sales of our products depend in part on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, principally Medicare, Medicaid and private health insurance plans, to pay for all or a portion of the costs and fees associated with the use of our products. While procedures using our currently marketed products are eligible for reimbursement in the U.S., if surgical procedures utilizing our products are performed on an outpatient basis, it is possible that private payers may no longer provide reimbursement for the procedures using our products without further supporting data on the procedure. Any delays in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, adequate coverage or reimbursement for procedures using our products could significantly affect the acceptance of our products and have a significant adverse effect on our business. Additionally, third-party payers continue to review their coverage policies carefully for existing and new therapies and can, without notice, deny coverage for treatments that include the use of our products. Our business would be negatively impacted if there are any changes that reduce reimbursement for our products.

Operation of our business internationally is subject to our continued compliance with the laws and regulations of each country in which we operate, as well as the business and legal customs in those jurisdictions and geographies.

Our operations, both inside and outside the U.S., are subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and under the laws, regulations and customs of various jurisdictions and geographies. Our operations outside the U.S. are subject to special risks and restrictions, including, without limitation: fluctuations in currency values and foreign-currency exchange rates; exchange control regulations; changes in local political or economic conditions; governmental pricing directives; import and trade restrictions; import or export licensing requirements and trade policy; restrictions on the ability to repatriate funds; and other potentially detrimental domestic and foreign governmental practices or policies affecting U.S. companies doing business abroad, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the trade sanctions laws and regulations administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. Acts of terror or war may impair our ability to operate in particular countries or regions and may impede the flow of goods and services between countries. Customers in weakened economies may be unable to purchase our products, or it could become more expensive for them to purchase imported products in their local currency, or sell at competitive prices, and we may be unable to collect receivables from such customers. Further, changes in exchange rates may affect our net earnings, the book value of our assets outside the U.S. and our stockholders’ equity. Failure to comply with the laws and regulations that affect our global operations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.

Consolidation in the healthcare industry could lead to price concessions or exclusion of some suppliers from some markets, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Continued consolidation in the healthcare industry is expected to increase competition among providers of products and services to industry participants. This in turn has resulted and will likely continue to result in greater pricing pressures and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important market segments as GPOs, independent delivery networks and large single accounts continue to use their market power to consolidate purchasing decisions for some of our customers. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to impact the worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among our customers, which may reduce competition, exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and may adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.

We may be subject to or otherwise affected by federal and state healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse, health information privacy and security, and disclosure laws, and could face substantial penalties if we are unable to fully comply with such laws.

Although we do not provide healthcare services, submit claims for third-party reimbursement, or receive payments directly from any third-party payers for our products or the procedures in which our products are used, healthcare regulation significantly impacts our business. Healthcare fraud and abuse, health information privacy and security, and disclosure laws potentially applicable to our operations include:

•
the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, as well as state analogs, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal (or state or commercial) healthcare program (such as the Medicare or Medicaid programs);

•
federal and state bans on physician self-referrals, which prohibits, subject to exceptions, physician referrals of Medicare and Medicaid patients to an entity providing certain “designated health services” if the physician or its immediate family member has any financial relationship with the entity;

•
false claims laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent;

•
HIPAA, and its implementing regulations, which created federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;

•
the state and federal laws “sunshine” provisions that require detailed reporting and disclosures to the CMS and applicable states of any payments or “transfer of value” made or distributed to prescribers and other health care providers, and for certain states prohibit some forms of these payments, require the adoption of marketing codes of conduct, require the reporting of marketing expenditures and pricing information and constrain relationships with physicians and other referral sources;

•
the HITECH, which impose restrictions on uses and disclosures of protected health information and civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance and require the reporting of breaches to affected individuals, the government and in some cases the media in the event of a violation; and

•
a variety of state-imposed privacy and data security laws which require the protection of personal information beyond health information and which require reporting to state officials in the event of breach or violation and which impose both civil and criminal penalties.

If our operations, or those of our independent sales agents violate any of such laws or any regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from federal healthcare programs and/or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If the healthcare providers, sales agents or other entities with which we do business are found to violate applicable laws, they may be subject to sanctions, which could also have a negative impact on us. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.

Sales and marketing practices in the healthcare industry have been the subject of increased scrutiny from governmental agencies, and we believe that this trend will continue. Prosecutorial scrutiny and governmental oversight over the retention of healthcare professionals as consultants has affected and may continue to affect how medical device companies retain healthcare professionals as consultants. Our efforts to detect and prevent noncompliance with applicable laws may not be effective in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against them, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business.

If we fail to timely obtain governmental clearances or approvals for our future products or modifications to our products, our ability to commercially distribute and market our products could suffer.

Our products are subject to extensive governmental regulations. The clearance and approval process, particularly with the FDA, can be costly and time consuming, and such clearances or approvals may not be granted on a timely basis, if at all. In particular, the FDA permits commercial distribution of most new medical devices only after receiving 510(k) clearance, or approval of a PMA. The FDA may make its 510(k) clearance process more restrictive and increase the time or expense required to obtain clearances or could make it unavailable for some of our products. A PMA must be submitted if the device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process or is not exempt from premarket review by the FDA and must be supported by extensive data, including results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, manufacturing and control data and proposed labeling, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. The PMA process is more costly and uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process. In addition, any modification to a 510(k)-cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, design or manufacture, requires a new 510(k) clearance or possibly a PMA.

Commercial distribution and marketing of any of our products or product modifications will be delayed until regulatory clearance or approval is obtained which may take significantly longer than anticipated. Governmental authorities can delay, limit or deny clearance or approval of a device for many reasons, including:

•
our inability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority that our products are safe or effective for their intended uses, or that the clinical and other benefits of the device outweigh the risks; 

•
disagreement of the applicable regulatory authority with the design or implementation of our clinical trials or the interpretation of data from pre-clinical studies or clinical trials; 

•
serious and unexpected adverse effects experienced by participants in our clinical trials;

•
data from our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support clearance or approval, where required; 

•
our manufacturing process or facilities we use may not meet applicable requirements; or

•
approval policies or regulations of the applicable regulatory authorities change significantly in a manner rendering our clinical data or regulatory filings insufficient for clearance or approval.

Delays in obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals may delay or prevent commercialization of products we develop, require us to perform costly tests or studies, diminish any competitive advantages that we might otherwise have obtained and reduce our ability to generate revenues.

If we choose to acquire new and complementary businesses, products or technologies, we may be unable to complete these acquisitions or successfully integrate them in a cost-effective and non-disruptive manner.

Our success depends in part on our ability to continually enhance and broaden our product offering. Accordingly, we have pursued and intend to pursue the acquisition of complementary businesses, products or technologies. We do not know if we will be able to successfully complete any acquisitions or successfully integrate any acquired business. Our ability to successfully grow through acquisitions depends upon our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate suitable acquisition targets. These efforts could be expensive and time consuming, disrupt our ongoing business and distract management. If we are unable to integrate any future or recently acquired

Table of Contents

businesses, products or technologies effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.

We are dependent on our senior management team, sales and marketing team, engineering team and key surgeon advisors, and the loss of any of them could harm our business.

Our continued success depends in part upon the continued availability and contributions of our senior management, sales and marketing team and engineering team and the continued participation of our key surgeon advisors. We compete for personnel and advisors with other companies and organizations, many of which have greater name recognition and resources than we do. Changes to our senior management team, sales and marketing team, engineering team and key surgeon advisors, or our inability to attract or retain other qualified personnel or advisors, could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our business is dependent upon the effective operation of our information systems, software, or information security practices and those of our business partners or third-party service providers. Security breaches, loss of data and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information related to our business, prevent us from accessing critical information or expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business and our reputation.

We utilize many information systems and other software that are critical to our business, some of which are managed by third parties. We regularly use these information systems or software to collect and store sensitive data, including legally protected patient health and personally identifiable information, intellectual property information, and proprietary business information. We may be unable to maintain or improve our information systems and software or experience unanticipated delays, complications, or expenses in implementing, integrating, and operating our systems or incur substantial expenditures or interruptions in operations in connection with system improvements or implementations. The failure of our information systems or software or those of our business partners or third-party service providers to perform properly could disrupt our business and harm our reputation, which may result in decreased sales, increased overhead costs, excess or obsolete inventory, and product shortages, causing our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results to suffer.

The secure processing, storage, maintenance and transmission of this critical information is vital to our operations and business strategy, and we devote significant resources to protecting such information. Although we take measures to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to theft, loss, damage, and interruption from a number of potential sources and events, including unauthorized access or security breaches, data privacy breaches, natural or man-made disasters, cyber attacks, computer viruses, malware, phishing, denial of service attacks, power loss, or other disruptive events. Any such security incidents could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed by unauthorized parties, disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such security incidents could also result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, government enforcement actions and regulatory penalties. Unauthorized access, loss or disclosure could also interrupt our operations and result in damage to our reputation, each of which could adversely affect our business. As a result of new SEC rules and regulations, we are required to disclose, on a current basis pursuant to new Item 1.05 of SEC Form 8-K, any cybersecurity incident that we determine to be material and describe the material aspects of the nature, scope, and timing of the incident, as well as the material impact or reasonably likely material impact of the incident on us, including our financial condition and results of operations. We will also be required to describe, on a periodic basis, our processes, if any, for the assessment, identification, and management of material risks from cybersecurity threats, and describe whether any risks from cybersecurity threats have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition, our board’s oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats and management’s role in assessing and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats. We have incurred significant costs in an effort to detect and prevent security breaches and incidents, and we may face increased costs and requirements to expend substantial resources in the event of an actual or perceived security breach or incident and to comply with this new SEC cybersecurity rule. Additionally, our insurance policies may not be adequate to compensate us for the potential damages arising from any such disruption, failure or security breach or incident. In addition, such insurance may not be available to us in the future on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Further, our insurance may not cover all claims made against us and could have high deductibles in any event, and defending a suit, regardless of its merit, could be costly and divert management attention.

Nearly all of our operations are currently conducted in locations that may be at risk of damage from fire, earthquakes or other natural disasters.

We conduct nearly all of our business activities in or near known wildfire areas and earthquake fault zones. We have taken precautions to safeguard our facilities, including obtaining property and casualty insurance, and implementing health and safety protocols. We have developed an information technology disaster recovery plan. However, any future natural disaster could cause substantial delays in our operations, damage or destroy our equipment or inventory and cause us to incur additional expenses. A disaster could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our insurance against earthquakes, fires, and other natural disasters would not be adequate to cover a total loss of our facilities, may not be adequate to cover our losses in any particular case and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.

Public health crises, political crises, and other catastrophic events or other events outside of our control may impact our business.

A natural disaster (such as tsunami, power shortage, or flood), public health crisis (such as a pandemic or epidemic), political crisis (such as terrorism, war, political instability or other conflict), or other events outside of our control that may occur and may adversely impact our business and operating results. Moreover, these types of events could negatively impact surgeon or patient spending in the impacted region(s), which could adversely impact our operating results. We monitor such events and take actions that we deem reasonable given the circumstances. In the future other types of crises, may create an environment of business uncertainty around the world, which may hinder sales and/or supplies of our products nationally and internationally.

Alphatec Holdings is a holding company with no operations, and unless it receives dividends or other payments from its subsidiaries, it will be unable to fulfill its cash obligations.

As a holding company with no business operations, Alphatec Holdings’ material assets consist only of the common stock of its subsidiaries, dividends and other payments received from time to time from its subsidiaries, and the proceeds raised from the sale of debt and equity securities. Alphatec Holdings’ subsidiaries are legally distinct from Alphatec Holdings and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to make funds available to Alphatec Holdings. Alphatec Holdings will have to rely upon dividends and other payments from its subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to fulfill its cash obligations. Alphatec Holdings may not be able to access cash generated by its subsidiaries in order to fulfill cash commitments. The ability of Alphatec Spine, SafeOp, or EOS to make dividend and other payments to Alphatec Holdings is subject to the availability of funds after taking into account its subsidiaries’ funding requirements, the terms of its subsidiaries’ indebtedness and applicable state laws.

If we fail to properly manage our anticipated growth, our business could suffer.

While we intend to continue to pursue growth in our business, such anticipated growth is expected to place significant demands on our managerial, operational and financial resources and systems. Our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention from day-to-day activities to managing these anticipated growth activities. If we do not manage our anticipated growth effectively, the quality of our products, our relationships with physicians, sales agents and hospitals, and our reputation could suffer, which would have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The use of artificial intelligence ("AI") technology by our employees or business partners could result in misuse or loss of proprietary information, violation of laws and regulations, or damage to our reputation and credibility.

Our employees and business partners may use AI technology to perform their work. Our sensitive information could be leaked, disclosed, or revealed as a result of or in connection with use of AI technology. Additionally, the use and disclosure of personal data in AI technology is subject to various data privacy laws and other data privacy obligations. Governments have passed and are likely to pass additional laws regulating AI. Our use of this technology could result in additional compliance costs, regulatory investigations and actions and lawsuits. Further, the cost to comply with such laws or regulations, or decisions and/or guidance interpreting existing laws, could be significant and would increase our operating expenses, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Risks Related to Our Financial Results, Credit and Certain Financial Obligations and Need for Financing

We may need to raise additional funds in the future and such funds may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.

At December 31, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $138.8 million, accounts receivable, net, cash from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility with entities affiliated with MidCap Financial Trust ("Revolving Credit Facility"). We believe that our current sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our planned expenditures and meet our obligations for at least 12 months subsequent to the date the consolidated financial statements are issued. If needed, we will seek additional funds from public and private equity or debt financings, borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, new debt facilities or other sources to fund our projected operating requirements. Our capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:

•
the revenues generated by sales of our products;

•
the costs associated with expanding our sales and marketing efforts;

•
the expenses that we incur from the manufacture of our products by third parties and that we incur from selling our products;

•
the costs of developing new products or technologies;

•
the cost of obtaining and maintaining FDA or other regulatory approval or clearance for our products and products in development;

•
the cost of filing and prosecuting patent applications and defending and enforcing our patent and other intellectual property rights; 

•
the number and timing of acquisitions and other strategic transactions;

•
the costs and any payments we may make related to our pending litigation matters;

•
the costs associated with increased capital expenditures; and

•
the costs associated with our employee retention programs and related benefits.

As a result of these factors, we may need to raise additional funds and such funds may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. In addition, rules and regulations of the SEC may restrict our ability to conduct certain types of financing activities or may affect the timing of and the amounts we can raise by undertaking such activities.

Furthermore, if we issue additional equity or debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders may experience dilution and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. In addition, if we raise additional funds through collaboration, licensing or other similar arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our potential products or proprietary technologies, or to grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to repay debt or other liabilities, develop or enhance our products, execute our business plan, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated customer requirements. Any of these events could adversely affect our ability to achieve our development and commercialization goals and have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Covenants in our loan documents and indenture may restrict our business and operations and if we do not effectively manage our covenants, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

The loan agreements we entered into in connection with our Revolving Credit Facility and the Braidwell Term Loan as well as the indenture governing our outstanding 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the "2026 Notes") contain certain affirmative, operating or financial covenants. These covenants could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, our liquidity or our results of operations, and our inability to comply with any of these covenants could result in a default under the applicable loan agreement or indenture, which could result in an increase the applicable interest rate or all amounts borrowed under the applicable debt instrument, together with accrued interest and other fees, to become due and payable or, with respect to our Revolving Credit Facility, could result in MidCap

25

Table of Contents

refusing to make further extensions of credit to us. If our indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Braidwell Term Loan or the 2026 Notes were to be accelerated, if the amount of interest owing under such debt or, in the case of the Revolving Credit Facility, if MidCap refuses to make further extensions of credit to us, we may not have sufficient cash available to repay the amounts due, and we may be forced to seek an amendment to the applicable loan terms or obtain alternative financing, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, if we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due or upon an event of default, in the case of the Revolving Credit Facility and Braidwell Term Loan, the lender would also have the right to proceed against the collateral, including substantially all of our assets, granted to secure the indebtedness under the debt obligation. If the applicable lender proceeds against the collateral, such assets would no longer be available for use in our business, which would have a significant adverse effect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We have a history of net losses, we expect to continue to incur net losses in the near future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.

We have typically incurred net losses since our inception. As of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.3 billion. We have incurred significant net losses since inception and have relied on our ability to fund our operations through revenues from the sale of our products and equity and debt financings. Successful transition to profitability is dependent upon achieving a level of revenues adequate to support our cost structure. This may not occur and, unless and until it does, we will continue to need to raise additional capital. We may seek additional funds from public and private equity or debt financings, borrowings under new debt facilities or other sources to fund our projected operating requirements. However, we may not be able to obtain further financing on reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to raise additional funds on a timely basis, or at all, we would be materially adversely affected.

A significant economic downturn or volatility in the economy in any market in which we operate could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

As a result of our domestic and global business operations, our revenues are impacted by changes in domestic and global macroeconomic conditions. A weakening of economic conditions, including from a worsening of the ongoing labor shortage or rising in inflation, could lead to increased costs to our business and reductions in demand for our products. Weakened economic conditions or a recession could reduce the amounts that customers are willing or able to spend on our products. Furthermore, a high percentage of our expenses, including those related to inventory, capital investments, and operating costs are generally fixed in nature in the short term. If we are not able to timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from a weak or uncertain economic environment, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted.

Our quarterly financial results could fluctuate significantly.

Our quarterly financial results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from period to period, particularly because our sales prospects are uncertain. The level of our revenues and results of operations at any given time will be based primarily on the following factors:

•
acceptance of our products by spine surgeons, patients, hospitals and third-party payers;

•
demand and pricing of our products, and the mix of our products sold, because profit margins differ among our products;

•
timing of new product offerings, acquisitions, licenses or other significant events by us or our competitors;

•
our ability to grow and maintain a productive sales and marketing organization and independent sales agent network;

•
regulatory approvals and legislative changes affecting the products we may offer or those of our competitors;

•
successful integration of newly acquired businesses, technology and personnel into our business operations;

•
the effect of competing technological and market developments;

•
levels of third-party reimbursement for our products;

26

Table of Contents

•
interruption in the manufacturing or distribution of our products or our ability to produce or obtain products of satisfactory quality or in sufficient quantities to meet demand; and

•
changes in our ability to obtain FDA, state and international approval or clearance for our products.

In addition, until we have a larger base of spine surgeons using our products, occasional fluctuations in the use of our products by individual surgeons or small groups of surgeons will have a proportionately larger impact on our revenues than for companies with a larger customer base.

We cannot begin to commercialize any products that we seek to introduce in the U.S. without FDA approval or clearance. As a result, it will be difficult for us to forecast demand for these products with any degree of certainty. Any shortfalls in revenue or earnings from levels expected by our stockholders or by industry analysts could have a significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock in any given period.

Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property, Regulatory Penalties and Litigation

If our patents and other intellectual property rights do not adequately protect our products, we may lose market share to our competitors and be unable to operate our business profitably.

Our success depends significantly on our ability to protect our proprietary rights in the technologies used in our products. We rely on patent protection, as well as a combination of copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, and confidentiality and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology. These legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. For example, our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“PTO”) may deny or require significant narrowing of claims in our pending patent applications, and patents issued as a result of the pending patent applications, if any, may not provide us with significant commercial protection or be issued in a form that is advantageous to us. We could also incur substantial costs in proceedings before the PTO. These proceedings could result in adverse decisions as to the priority of our inventions and the narrowing or invalidation of claims in issued patents. Issued patents could subsequently be successfully challenged by others and invalidated or rendered unenforceable, which could limit our ability to prevent competitors from marketing and selling related products. In addition, our pending patent applications include claims to aspects of our products and procedures that are not currently protected by issued patents.

Both the patent application process and the process of managing patent disputes can be time consuming and expensive. Competitors may design around our patents or develop products that provide outcomes that are comparable to our products but fall outside of the scope of our patent protection. Although we have entered into confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with certain of our employees, consultants and advisors as one of the ways we seek to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary technology, such agreements may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements. In the event a competitor infringes upon one of our patents or other intellectual property rights, enforcing those patents and rights may be difficult and time consuming. Even if successful, litigation to defend our patents against challenges or to enforce our intellectual property rights could be expensive and time consuming and could divert management’s attention from managing our business. Moreover, we may not have sufficient resources to defend our patents against challenges or to enforce our intellectual property rights.

The medical device industry is characterized by patent and other intellectual property litigation and we could become subject to litigation that could be costly, result in the diversion of management’s time and efforts, require us to pay damages, and/or prevent us from marketing our existing or future products.

The medical device industry is characterized by extensive litigation and administrative proceedings over patent and other intellectual property rights. Determining whether a product infringes a patent involves complex legal and factual issues, the determination of which is often uncertain. Our competitors may assert that our products, components of those products, methods of using those products, or methods we employ to manufacture or process those products are covered by patents held by them. In addition, they may claim that their patents have priority over ours because their patents were filed first. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be applications now pending of which we are unaware, which may later result in issued patents that our products may infringe. There could

27

Table of Contents

also be existing patents that one or more components of our products may be inadvertently infringing, of which we are unaware. As the number of participants in the market for spine disorder devices and treatments increases, the possibility of patent infringement claims against us also increases.

Any such claim against us, even those without merit, may cause us to incur substantial costs, and could place a significant strain on our financial resources, divert the attention of management from our core business and harm our reputation. If the relevant patents are upheld as valid and enforceable and we are found to infringe, we could be required to pay substantial damages and/or royalties and we could be prevented from selling our products unless we obtain a license or redesign our products to avoid infringement. Any such license may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all, and we may be unable to redesign our products to not infringe those patents, and any such redesign, if possible, may be costly. If we fail to obtain any required licenses or make any necessary changes to our products, we may have to withdraw existing products from the market or may be unable to commercialize one or more of our products, either of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may lose market share to our competitors if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights.

In addition, we enter into agreements with spine surgeons to develop new products. As consideration for product development activities rendered pursuant to these agreements, in some instances we have agreed to pay royalties on products developed by cooperative involvement between us and such surgeons. The surgeons with whom we have entered into such an arrangement might claim to be entitled to a royalty even if we do not believe that such products were developed by cooperative involvement between us and such surgeons. Any such claim, even those without merit, may cause us to incur substantial costs, and could place a significant strain on our financial resources, divert the attention of management from our core business and harm our reputation.

If we become subject to product liability claims, we may be required to pay damages that exceed our insurance coverage.

Our business exposes us to potential product liability claims that are inherent in the manufacture and sale of medical devices for spine surgery procedures. Spine surgery involves significant risk of serious complications, including paralysis and even death. We carry product liability insurance. However, our product liability insurance coverage may be inadequate to satisfy liabilities we might incur. Any product liability claim brought against us could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates or our inability to secure coverage in the future on commercially reasonable terms. If our product liability insurance proves to be inadequate to pay a damage award, we may have to pay the excess out of our cash reserves, which could harm our financial condition. If longer-term patient results and experience indicate that our products or any component of our products cause tissue damage, motor impairment or other adverse effects, we could be subject to significant liability. Even a meritless or unsuccessful product liability claim could harm our reputation in the industry, lead to significant legal fees and result in the diversion of management’s attention from managing our business. If a product liability claim or series of claims is brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage limits, our business could suffer and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow could be materially adversely impacted.

Because biologics products entail a potential risk of communicable disease to human recipients, we may be the subject of product liability claims regarding our biologics products.

Our biologics products may expose us to additional potential product liability claims. The development of biologics products entails the risk of transmitting disease to human recipients, and substantial product liability claims may be asserted against us. In addition, successful product liability claims made against one of our competitors could cause claims to be made against us or expose us to a perception that we are vulnerable to similar claims. Even a meritless or unsuccessful product liability claim could harm our reputation in the industry, lead to significant legal fees and result in the diversion of management’s attention from managing our business.

Any claims relating to our improper handling, storage or disposal of biological, hazardous and radioactive materials could be time consuming and costly.

The manufacture of certain of our products, including our biologics products, involves the controlled use of biological, hazardous and/or radioactive materials and waste. Our business and facilities and those of our suppliers are subject to laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and waste. Although we believe that our safety procedures comply with legally prescribed standards, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines, which could exceed our resources and insurance. We may incur significant expenses in the future relating to any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, which could have a significant negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Risks Related to Our Common Stock

Our stock price may fluctuate significantly, particularly if holders of substantial amounts of our stock attempt to sell, and holders may have difficulty selling their shares based on trading volumes of our stock.

The market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to many factors, including those described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section and the following:

•
volume and timing of orders for our products;

•
quarterly variations in our or our competitors’ results of operations;

•
our announcement or our competitors’ announcements regarding new or enhanced products, product enhancements, significant contracts, number of sales agents, number of hospitals and spine surgeons using products, acquisitions, and collaborative or strategic investments;

•
announcements of technological or medical innovations for the treatment of spine pathology;

•
changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;

•
our ability to develop, obtain regulatory clearance or approval for, and market new and enhanced products on a timely basis;

•
changes in healthcare policy in the U.S., including changes in governmental regulations or in the status of our regulatory approvals, clearances or applications, and changes in the availability of third-party reimbursement in the U.S.;

•
product liability claims or other litigation involving us, including disputes or other developments with respect to intellectual property rights;

•
sales of large blocks of our common stock, including sales by our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders;

•
changes in accounting principles; and

•
general market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors.

We may become involved in securities class action litigation that could divert management’s attention and harm our business.

The stock market in general, the NASDAQ Global Select Market and the market for medical device companies in particular, has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company’s securities, the company becomes subject to securities class action litigation. We may become involved in this type of litigation. Litigation is often expensive and diverts management’s attention and resources, which could materially harm our financial condition, results of operations and business.

Securities analysts may not provide coverage of our common stock or may issue negative reports, which may have a negative impact on the market price of our common stock.

Securities analysts may not provide research coverage of our common stock. The trading market for our common stock may be affected in part by the research and reports that analysts publish about our business. If one or more of the analysts who elects to cover us downgrades our stock, our stock price could likely decline rapidly. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.

Because of their significant stock ownership, our executive officers, directors and principal stockholders will be able to exert control over us and our significant corporate decisions.

Based on shares outstanding at February 19, 2025, our executive officers, directors and stockholders holding more than 5% of our outstanding common stock and their affiliates, in the aggregate, beneficially own approximately 30% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these persons will have the ability to impact significantly the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentration of ownership may harm the market price of our common stock by delaying, deferring or preventing our change in control, causing us to enter into transactions or agreements that are not in the best interests of all of our stockholders, or reducing our public float held by non-affiliates.

Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and change of control provisions in some of our employment agreements and agreements with sales agents, and in some of our outstanding debt agreements, as well as the terms of our redeemable preferred stock, may discourage or prevent a change of control, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, which could affect our stock price adversely.

Certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and restated by-laws could discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions also could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. Stockholders who wish to participate in these transactions may not have the opportunity to do so. Furthermore, these provisions could prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions:

•
allow the authorized number of directors to be changed only by resolution of our Board of Directors;

•
allow vacancies on our Board of Directors to be filled only by resolution of our Board of Directors;

•
authorize our Board of Directors to issue, without stockholder approval, blank check preferred stock that, if issued, could operate as a “poison pill” to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer to prevent an acquisition that is not approved by our Board of Directors;

•
require that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and prohibit stockholder action by written consent;

•
establish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations to our Board of Directors and for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings; and

•
limit who may call stockholder meetings.

These provisions may frustrate or prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our Board of Directors, which is responsible for appointing our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us.

Some of our agreements provide for accelerated vesting of benefits, including full vesting of restricted stock and options, upon a change of control, or extends the term of the agreement upon a change in control and make it more difficult for us or our successor to terminate the agreement. These provisions may discourage or prevent a change of control.

In addition, in the event of a change of control, we would be required to redeem all outstanding shares of our redeemable preferred stock for an aggregate of $29.9 million, at the price of $9.00 per share. Further, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation permits us to issue additional shares of preferred stock. The terms of our redeemable preferred stock or any new preferred stock we may issue could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control.

Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.

Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” generally defined as a cumulative change in its equity ownership by “5-percent shareholders” of greater than 50 percentage points (by value) over a three-year period, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”), and certain other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change taxable income and taxes may be limited. We have completed multiple rounds of financing and entered into transactions which may subject us to the Section 382 limitations. We may also experience ownership changes in the future. As a result, our ability to use our NOLs and research and development credits to offset our U.S. federal taxable income and taxes may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. In addition, similar rules may also apply at the state level, and there may be periods during which the use of NOLs is suspended or limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed.

We could be subject to changes in our tax rates, new tax legislation or additional tax liabilities.

We are subject to taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate our worldwide tax liabilities. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. Our effective income tax rates have been, and could in the future be, adversely affected by changes in tax laws or interpretations of those tax laws; by stock-based compensation and other non-deductible expenses; by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates; or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.

Our tax returns and other tax matters also are subject to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. We cannot guarantee the outcome of these examinations. If our effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S., or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected.

Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy
We recognize the need to maintain the security and confidentiality of personal information, protected health information, and other confidential data that we collect and use in connection with our business, and the importance of assessing, identifying, and managing various cybersecurity risks that may impact our business. We have developed and implemented a cybersecurity risk management program intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our critical systems and information. Our cybersecurity risk management program includes a cybersecurity incident response plan.

31

Table of Contents

We design and assess our program based on various cybersecurity frameworks, most prominently the Health Information Trust Alliance (“HITRUST”) Common Security Framework, and Service Organization Controls (“SOC”) 2, developed by the American Institute of CPAs. In 2024, our cybersecurity systems, supporting infrastructure and EOS products received HITRUST e1 certification as they met the HITRUST CSF v11.20 certification criteria. We use this cybersecurity framework and information security controls as a guide to help us identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risks relevant to our business. Our cybersecurity program includes annual review and assessment by external, independent third parties, who certify and report on these programs.
As part of our enterprise risk management process, we assess the various cybersecurity risks that may impact our business and implement plans and initiatives that are intended to mitigate those risks.
Our information security program includes: (i) risk assessments designed to help identify material cybersecurity risks to our critical systems, information, products, software, and services; (ii) an information security team principally responsible for managing our (1) information security risk assessment processes, (2) security controls, and (3) response to cybersecurity incidents; (iii) risk assessments and security tests, conducted internally and by external security and risk audit providers, as appropriate; (iv) new-hire and annual cybersecurity awareness training of our employees; (v) a cybersecurity incident response plan that includes procedures for responding to cybersecurity incidents; and (vi) third-party risk assessment procedures to review material third-party vendors and applications for information security.
We have not identified any risks from known cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any prior cybersecurity incidents, that have 
materially affected
 or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.
Cybersecurity Governance
Our Board considers cybersecurity risk as part of its risk oversight function and has delegated to the Audit Committee oversight over our information security and technology risks, including our information security, cybersecurity and related risk management programs.

The Audit Committee oversees management’s implementation of our information security program and receives periodic reports from management on our material cybersecurity risks. Additionally, management updates the Audit Committee, as necessary, regarding material cybersecurity incidents. 
The full Board receives quarterly updates from management on our information security program.
Our management team, including our IT management team, is responsible for assessing and managing our material risks from cybersecurity threats.

The team has primary responsibility for our overall cybersecurity risk management program and supervises both our internal cybersecurity personnel and our retained external cybersecurity consultants. 
To support data security, we have established an 
integrated
 risk management framework with practices that are derived from industry standards, including ISO 27001, HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF) 11.2 certification, the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, and data privacy regulations, including HIPAA and the General Data Protection Regulation.
 The data security controls from these standards and regulations are evaluated for our risk management framework based on the needs of our business and our clients, the nature of our industry, and applicable regulations.
Our management team oversees efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate, and remediate cybersecurity risks and incidents through various means, which may include briefings from internal security personnel, threat intelligence and other information obtained from governmental, public, or private sources, including external consultants 
engaged
 by us, and alerts and reports produced by security tools deployed in the information technology environment.
