Overview

We are a medical technology company, headquartered in Carlsbad, California, focused on the design, development, and advancement of technology for better surgical treatment of spine disorders. By applying our unique, 100% spine focus and deep industry know-how, we aim to revolutionize spine surgery through clinical distinction. The sophisticated approaches that we create from the ground up integrate with our expanding Alpha InformatiX™ ("AIX") platform to objectively inform surgery and achieve the goals of spine surgery more predictably and more reproducibly. We have a comprehensive product portfolio designed to address the spine’s various pathologies and we are perpetually innovating to accomplish our vision to be the standard bearer in spine.

The application of our team’s deep spine know-how, coupled with a willingness to invest holistically in each of the technologies integrated into all of our procedural approaches continues to increasingly compel surgeons and sales talent to partner with us. That adoption-driven validation has been the source of industry-leading market share expansion, which has delivered an approximately 40% revenue compound annual growth rate since our transformation commenced in 2018.

We market and sell our products through a network of independent sales agents and direct sales representatives. To deliver consistent, predictable growth, we have added, and intend to continue to add, clinically astute and exclusive sales team members to reach untapped surgeons, hospitals, and national accounts and better penetrate existing accounts and territories.

Revenue and Expense Components

The following is a description of the primary components of our revenue and expenses:

Revenue.
 We derive our revenue primarily from the sale of spinal surgery implants used in the treatment of spine disorders, as well as from the sale of medical imaging equipment which is used for surgical planning and post-operative assessment. Spinal implant products include pedicle screws and complementary implants, interbody devices, plates, and tissue-based materials. Medical imaging equipment includes our EOS full-body and weight-bearing x-ray imaging devices, and related services. Our revenue is generated by our direct sales force and independent sales agents. Our products are shipped and invoiced to hospitals and surgical centers. Currently, most of our business is conducted with customers within markets in which we have experience and with payment terms that are customary to our business. We may defer revenue until the time of collection if circumstances related to payment terms, regional market risk or customer history indicate that collectability is not certain.

Cost of sales
. Cost of sales consists primarily of direct product costs, royalties, service labor hours, and parts. Our product costs consist primarily of raw materials, component parts, direct labor, and overhead. The product costs of certain of our biologics products include the cost of procuring and processing human tissue. We incur royalties related to the technologies that we license from others and the products that are developed in part by surgeons with whom we collaborate in the product development process.

36

Table of Contents

Research and development expenses
. Research and development expenses consist of costs associated with the design, development, testing, and enhancement of our products. Research and development expenses also include salaries and related employee benefits, research-related overhead expenses, and fees paid to external service providers and development consultants in the form of both cash and equity.

Sales, general and administrative expenses
. Sales, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related employee benefits, sales commissions and other variable costs, depreciation of our surgical instruments, regulatory affairs, quality assurance costs, professional service fees, travel, medical education, trade show and marketing costs, and insurance expenses.

Litigation-related expenses. 
Litigation-related expenses are costs incurred for our ongoing and settled litigation.

Amortization expense. 
Amortization expense includes amortization of acquired intangible assets and amortization of internally-developed software that has been placed in service. Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and asset purchases.

Transaction-related expenses. 
Transaction-related expenses consist of certain costs incurred related primarily to the acquisition and integration of Valence.

Restructuring expenses
. Restructuring expenses primarily consist of severance, social plan benefits and related tax costs incurred in connection with cost rationalization efforts, as well as costs associated with the opening or closing of office and warehouse facilities.

Total interest and other expense, net
. Total interest and other expense, net includes interest income, interest expense, gains and losses from foreign currency exchanges and other non-operating gains and losses.

Income tax provision.
 Income tax provision primarily consists of an estimate of federal, state, and foreign income taxes based on enacted state and foreign tax rates, as adjusted for allowable credits, deductions, uncertain tax positions, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws.

Cost of sales increased by $15.2 million, or 9%, during the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in product volume offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation. We have entered into Development Service Agreements for the development of a wide variety of potential products and intellectual property. Under these agreements, future royalty payments for product and/or intellectual property rights may be paid in either cash or restricted shares of our common stock at the election of the developer, depending on the terms of the agreement. Certain of these agreements were amended to remove the cash royalty option and require settlement in restricted shares of our common stock. Stock-based compensation associated with these awards was higher during the year ended December 31, 2023 as the vesting conditions of certain of these amended awards that met the requirements for presentation within cost of sales were deemed probable at that time.

Research and development expenses
. Research and development expenses increased by $10.6 million, or 15%, during the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel to support the expansion of our new product portfolio and an increase in stock-based compensation associated with Development Service Agreements (as described above), as the vesting conditions of certain of these amended awards, that met the requirements for presentation within research and development, were deemed probable during the year.

Sales, general and administrative expenses.
 Sales, general and administrative expenses increased by $76.1 million, or 20%, during the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher compensation-related costs and variable selling expenses associated with the increase in revenue, and our continued investment in building our strategic sales channel. Additionally, we have increased our investment in our sales and marketing functions by increasing headcount to support the growth of our business.

Litigation-related expenses. 
Litigation-related expenses decreased by $12.5 million, or 56%, during the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily related to a decrease in legal fees associated with our previously settled litigation matters. Refer to Note 7 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding litigation matters.

Amortization expense.
 Amortization expense increased $2.0 million, or 14%, during the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in amortization expense is primarily due to amortization of intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of Valence in April 2023 and internally-developed software placed in service during 2024.

Transaction-related expenses. 
Transaction-related expenses decreased $1.9 million, or 90%, during the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in transaction-related expenses is due to the Valence acquisition in April 2023.

Restructuring expenses
. Restructuring expenses increased $2.5 million, or 352%, during the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in restructuring expenses is primarily due to costs associated with the relocation of office facilities in Paris, France, and severance and related tax costs incurred in connection with cost rationalization efforts.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash equivalents, our Revolving Credit Facility, and cash from operations. Our liquidity and capital structure are evaluated regularly within the context of our annual operating and strategic planning process. We consider the liquidity necessary to fund our operations, which includes working capital needs, investments in research and development, investments in our sales channel and expansion, investments in inventory and instrument sets to support our customers, as well as other operating costs. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our rate of revenue growth, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales, marketing and administrative activities, the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products, and the international expansions of our business.

As current borrowing sources become due, we may be required to access the capital markets for additional funding. If we are required to access the debt markets, we expect to be able to secure reasonable borrowing rates. As part of our liquidity strategy, we will continue to monitor our current level of spending and cash use as well as our ability to secure additional credit facilities, term loans, or other similar arrangements in light of our spending levels and general financial market conditions.

39

Table of Contents

A substantial portion of our operations are in the U.S., and most of our net sales have been made in the U.S. Accordingly, we do not have material exposures to foreign currency rate fluctuations from operations. However, as our business in markets outside of the U.S. continues to increase, we will be exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to our foreign operations.

We do not have any material financial exposure to one customer or one country, outside the U.S., that would significantly hinder our liquidity. We are and may become involved in various legal proceedings arising from our business activities. While we have no material accruals for pending litigation or claims for which accrual amounts are not disclosed in our consolidated financial statements, litigation is inherently unpredictable, and depending on the nature and timing of a proceeding, an unfavorable resolution could materially affect our future consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position in a particular period. We assess contingencies to determine the degree of probability and range of possible loss for potential accrual or disclosure in our consolidated financial statements. An estimated loss contingency is accrued in our consolidated financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events because litigation is inherently unpredictable, and unfavorable resolutions could occur. When evaluating contingencies, we may be unable to provide a meaningful estimate due to a number of factors, including the procedural status of the matter in question, the presence of complex or novel legal theories, and/or the ongoing discovery and development of information important to the matters. In addition, damage amounts claimed in litigation against us may be unsupported, exaggerated, or unrelated to reasonably possible outcomes, and as such are not meaningful indicators of our potential liability. We have disclosed all material accruals for pending litigation or investigations in Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.

Cash and cash equivalents were $138.8 million and $221.0 million at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We have available borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility discussed above. We believe that our existing funds, cash generated from our operations and our existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital, capital expenditure, debt service requirements and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue.

Operating Activities

We used net cash of $44.7 million from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2024. The cash used in operating activities primarily related to costs associated with the continued expansion of our business and inventory purchases, offset by the timing of cash payments and receipts.

Investing Activities

We used cash of $93.1 million in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024, which is primarily related to the purchase of surgical instruments to support the growth of our business and commercial launch of new products.

Financing Activities

Financing activities provided net cash of $56.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, which is primarily related to proceeds from our term loan and net draws on our revolving line of credit.

Debt and Commitments

As of December 31, 2024, we had $200.0 million outstanding under the Braidwell Term Loan. The outstanding loans under the Braidwell Term Loan bear interest at the sum of SOFR plus 5.75% per annum. The Braidwell Term Loan matures on January 6, 2028.

As of December 31, 2024, we had $63.3 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. The outstanding loans bear interest at the sum of SOFR plus 3.5% per annum. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on the earlier of September 29, 2027, or 90 days prior to the final maturity date of any of our outstanding 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the "2026 Notes").

As of December 31, 2024, we had $316.3 million outstanding under the 2026 Notes. The 2026 Notes accrue interest at a rate of 0.75%, payable semi-annually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year. Prior to maturity in August 2026, the holders of the 2026 Notes may, under certain circumstances, choose to convert their notes into shares of our common stock. Based on the terms, we have the option to pay or deliver cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination thereof, when a conversion notice is received.

As of December 31, 2024, we had $3.0 million in other debts that are due in monthly and quarterly installments through maturity in 2027.

We have an inventory purchase commitment agreement with a third-party supplier, where we are obligated to certain minimum purchase commitment requirements through December 2025. As of December 31, 2024, the remaining minimum purchase commitment under the agreement was $8.8 million.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those related to revenue recognition, allowances for accounts receivable, inventories, intangible assets, stock-based compensation, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumption conditions.

We believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

42

Table of Contents

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue from product sales in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 (“Topic 606”). This standard applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards, such as leases. Under Topic 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of Topic 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that we will collect the consideration we are entitled to in exchange for the goods or services that we transfer to the customer.

Sales are derived primarily from the sale of spinal implant products, imaging equipment, and related services to hospitals and medical centers. Revenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with customers are satisfied, which occurs with the transfer of control of products to customers, either upon shipment of the product or delivery of the product to the customer depending on the shipping terms, or when the products are used in a surgical procedure (implanted in a patient). Revenue from the sale of imaging equipment is recognized as each distinct performance obligation is fulfilled and control transfers to the customer, beginning with shipment or delivery, depending on the contract terms. Revenue from other distinct performance obligations, such as maintenance on imaging equipment, and other imaging related services, is recognized in the period the service is performed, and makes up less than 10% of our total revenue. In certain cases, we offer the ability for customers to lease our imaging equipment primarily on a non-sales type basis, but such arrangements are immaterial to total revenue in the years presented. We generally do not allow returns of products that have been delivered. Costs incurred by us associated directly with sales contracts with customers are deferred over the performance obligation period and recognized in the same period as the related revenue, except for contracts that complete within one year or less, in which case the associated costs are expensed as incurred. Payment terms for sales to customers may vary but are commensurate with the general business practices in the country of sale.

To the extent that the transaction price includes variable consideration, such as discounts, rebates, and customer payment penalties, we estimate the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price utilizing either the expected value method or the most likely amount method depending on the nature of the variable consideration. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in our judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. Estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information that is reasonably available, including historical, current, and forecasted information.

We record a contract asset when one or more performance obligations have been completed and revenue has been recognized, but the customer's payment is contingent on the satisfaction of additional performance obligations. We record a contract liability, or deferred revenue, when we have an obligation to provide a product or service to the customer and payment is received in advance of our performance. When we sell a product or service with a future performance obligation, revenue is deferred on the unfulfilled performance obligation and recognized over the related performance period. Generally, we estimate the selling price of promised services included in the equipment sales price using an expected cost plus a margin approach and/or the separately observable price of such service, if available. The transaction price for a contract’s various performance obligations is allocated using the relative standalone selling price method. The use of alternative estimates could result in a different amount of revenue deferral.

Table of Contents

Excess and Obsolete Inventory

Most of our inventory is comprised of finished goods, and we primarily utilize third-party suppliers to produce our products. Specialized implants, fixation products, biologics, and imaging equipment are determined by utilizing a standard cost method, which includes capitalized variances, which approximates the weighted average cost. Component parts related to the imaging equipment are valued at weighted average cost. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We review the components of inventory on a periodic basis for excess and obsolescence and adjust inventory to its net realizable value as necessary.

We record a lower of cost or net realizable value inventory reserve (“LCNRV”) for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon our expected use of inventory on hand. Our inventory, which consists primarily of specialized implants, fixation products, and biologics is at risk of obsolescence due to the need to maintain substantial levels of inventory. In order to market our products effectively and meet the demands of interoperative product placement, we maintain and provide surgeons and hospitals with a variety of inventory products and sizes. For each surgery, fewer than all components will be consumed. The need to maintain and provide such a variety of inventory causes inventory to be held that is not likely to be used.

Our estimates and assumptions for excess and obsolete inventory are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. The estimates and assumptions are determined primarily based on current usage of inventory and the age of inventory quantities on hand. Additionally, we consider recent sales experience to develop assumptions about future demand for our products, while considering product life cycles and new product launches. Increases in the LCNRV reserve for excess and obsolete inventory result in a corresponding charge to cost of sales.

Valuation of Goodwill

Our goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired from our business combinations. The determination of the value of goodwill and intangible assets arising from business combinations and asset acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is assessed for impairment using fair value measurement techniques on an annual basis or more frequently if facts and circumstance warrant such a review. Goodwill is considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its respective fair value.

Valuation of Intangible Assets

Our intangible assets are comprised primarily of purchased technology, internally developed software, customer relationships, trade name, trademarks, and in-process research and development. We make significant judgments in relation to the valuation of intangible assets resulting from business combinations and asset acquisitions. Intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of 2 to 12 years. We base the useful lives and related amortization expense on the period of time we estimate the assets will generate net sales or otherwise be used. We also periodically review the lives assigned to our intangible assets to ensure that our initial estimates do not exceed any revised estimated periods from which we expect to realize cash flows. If a change were to occur in any of the above-mentioned factors or estimates, the likelihood of a material change in our reported results would increase. We evaluate our intangible assets with finite lives for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends. If this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired, we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life. If this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable, based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset over the remaining amortization period, we reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value and may adjust the remaining amortization period. Significant judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow valuation models. It is possible that plans may change and estimates used may prove to be inaccurate. If our actual results, or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses, are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets, we could incur additional impairment charges.

Table of Contents

In-process research and development ("IPR&D") and software in development have indefinite lives and are not amortized until the related products reach full commercial launch or when the projects are complete and their assets are ready for their intended use. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are considered to be impaired if the products do not reach commercial launch, if the project is not completed or not completed in a timely manner, or if the related products or projects are no longer technologically feasible. Impairment related to IPR&D and software in development is calculated as the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value.

Valuation of Stock-Based Compensation

Stock-based compensation expense for equity-classified awards, principally related to restricted stock units ("RSUs") and performance restricted stock units ("PRSUs") is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award. The fair value of equity instruments that are expected to vest is recognized and amortized over the requisite service period. We have granted awards with up to four year graded or cliff vesting terms. No exercise price or other monetary payment is required for receipt of the shares issued in settlement of the respective award; instead, consideration is furnished in the form of the participant’s service.

The fair value of RSUs including PRSUs with pre-defined performance criteria is based on the stock price on the date of grant whereas the expense for PRSUs with pre-defined performance criteria is adjusted with the probability of achievement of such performance criteria at each year end.

Stock-based compensation recorded in our consolidated statements of operations is based on awards expected to ultimately vest and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Our estimated forfeiture rates may differ from our actual forfeitures. We consider our historical experience of pre-vesting forfeitures on awards by each homogenous group of employees as the basis to arrive at our estimated annual pre-vesting forfeiture rates.

We estimate the fair value of stock options issued under our equity incentive plans and shares issued to employees under our employee stock purchase plan ("ESPP"), using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model on the date of grant. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model incorporates various assumptions including expected volatility, expected term and risk-free interest rates. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected term of our stock options and ESPP offering period which is derived from historical experience. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant. We have never declared or paid dividends and have no plans to do so in the foreseeable future.

Awards to non-employees are accounted for under the same stock-based compensation provisions as employees, which require that the fair value of these instruments be recognized as an expense when earned. For Development Service Agreements, where the future payments for product and/or intellectual property rights may be paid in either cash or restricted shares of our common stock at the election of the developer we estimate the fair value of those awards similar to a stock option, using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model on the date of grant. For Development Service Agreements where the future payments for product and/or intellectual property rights will be paid in restricted shares of our common stock, the fair value is based on the stock price on the date of grant. The stock-based compensation expense is recognized as earned once the award is deemed probable of achieving the pre-defined performance criteria. The stock-based compensation expense is included in cost of sales or research and development expense on the consolidated statements of operations commensurate with the nature of services performed.

Item 7A.	Quantitative and Qualita
tive Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to interest rate risks related to our cash, cash equivalents and borrowings. We had cash and cash equivalents of 138.8 million as of December 31, 2024, which consist of cash and money market funds. Interest-earning deposit accounts and money market funds carry a degree of interest rate risk; however, historical fluctuations in interest income have not been significant.

Loans under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Braidwell Term Loan bear interest at floating rates tied to SOFR. As a result, changes in SOFR can affect our results of operation and cash flows. As of December 31, 2024, the outstanding balance under the Braidwell Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility was $200.0 million and $63.3 million, respectively. The interest rates for the Braidwell Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2024 were 10.4% and 8.2%, respectively.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

As our business in markets outside of the U.S. continues to increase, we may be exposed to foreign currency exchange risks related to our foreign operations. Fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the U.S. and foreign currencies, primarily the euro, could adversely affect our financial results. We do not have any material financial exposure to one customer or one country that would significantly hinder our liquidity.

Commodity Price Risk

We purchase raw materials that are processed from commodities, such as titanium and stainless steel. These purchases expose us to fluctuations in commodity prices. Given the historical volatility of certain commodity prices, this exposure can impact our product costs. However, because our raw material prices comprise a small portion of our cost of sales, we have not experienced any material impact on our results of operations from changes in commodity prices. A 10% change in commodity prices would not have had a material impact on our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Item 9A.	Controls
 and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the timelines specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in SEC Rules 13a - 15(e) and 15d - 15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2024. Based on such evaluation, our management has concluded as of December 31, 2024, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) to evaluate the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024, based on those criteria.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, who audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. This report states that internal control over financial reporting was effective and appears in “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm” in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We are involved in ongoing evaluations of internal controls. In anticipation of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with the assistance of other members of our management, performed an evaluation of any change in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. There has been no change to our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 9B.	Other
 Information

Adoption, Modification or Termination of Trading Arrangements

A portion of the compensation of our directors and officers is in the form of equity awards, and, from time to time, directors and officers engage in open-market transactions with respect to the securities they acquire pursuant to such equity awards we have issued.

Transactions in our securities by directors and officers are required to be made in accordance with our insider trading policy, which requires that the transactions comply with applicable U.S. federal securities laws that prohibit trading while in possession of material nonpublic information. Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act provides an affirmative defense that enables directors and officers to prearrange transactions in our securities in a manner that avoids concerns about initiating transactions while in possession of material nonpublic information.

The following table describes the contracts, instructions or written plans for the purchase or sale of securities adopted by our directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended December 31, 2024, that are intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c). No other Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements or “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements” (as defined by S-K Item 408(c)) were

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Alphatec Holdings, Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Alphatec Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity (deficit), and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 26, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Valuation of Inventories - Refer to Note 1 to the Financial Statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

The Company records its inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value (“LCNRV”). A portion of the Company’s LCNRV reserve represents an amount for specialized implants and fixation products (collectively “implant inventory”). Quarterly, the Company records an adjustment to its LCNRV reserve for estimated excess and obsolete implant inventory based upon its expected use of implant inventory on hand. To determine the expected use of implant inventory, management develops estimates and assumptions primarily based on the current usage of implant inventory, and the age of implant inventory quantities on hand. Additionally, the Company considers recent sales experience to develop assumptions about future demand for its products, while considering product life cycles and new product launches.

We identified management’s estimation of the implant inventory LCNRV reserve as a critical audit matter due to management’s significant manual process used to determine the estimate and the judgments required by management to estimate future use of their products. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s assumptions related to the expected use of implant inventory in future operations.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to management’s judgments used to estimate the implant inventory LCNRV reserve included the following, among others:

•
We tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s estimate of the implant inventory LCNRV reserve, including:

o
management’s assessment of assumptions used to identify excess and obsolete implant inventory and to estimate the related LCNRV reserve.

o
the completeness and accuracy of data used in the calculation.

•
We evaluated the reasonableness of the methodology used by the Company to estimate the implant inventory LCNRV reserve by comparing actual results to the historical estimates.

•
We evaluated the key assumptions used in identifying the population of implant inventory with excess or obsolescence exposure that require a reserve and determining the amount of reserve to record.

•
We evaluated the appropriateness of the underlying data utilized in management’s analysis, including current implant inventory usage, product aging, recent sales, and product life cycle.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Alphatec Holdings, Inc.

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Alphatec Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 26, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

ALPHATEC HOLDINGS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Organization and Significant Accounting Policies
The Company
Alphatec Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”), through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Alphatec Spine, Inc. (“Alphatec Spine”), SafeOp Surgical, Inc. (“SafeOp”), and EOS imaging S.A.S. (“EOS”), is a medical technology company focused on the design, development, and advancement of technology for the better surgical treatment of spinal disorders. The Company, headquartered in Carlsbad, California, markets its products in the United States ("U.S.") and internationally via a network of independent sales agents and direct sales representatives.

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. The Company translates the financial statements of its foreign subsidiaries using end-of-period exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during each reporting period for results of operations. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company operates in 
one
 reportable business segment.
Reclassification
Certain financial statement line items in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 have been aggregated to conform to the current year’s presentation.

Use of Estimates
The carrying amount of financial instruments consisting of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and short-term debt included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements are reasonable estimates of fair value due to their short maturities.

Concentrations of Credit Risk and Significant Customers
Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, and accounts receivable. The Company limits its exposure to credit loss by depositing its cash and investments with established financial institutions. Although the Company deposits its cash with multiple financial institutions, its deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits.
The Company’s customers are primarily hospitals and surgical centers.

No
 one single customer represented greater than 10 percent of consolidated revenues and accounts receivable for the years presented. 
Credit to customers is granted based on an analysis of the customers’ credit worthiness. Credit losses have not been significant.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The company considers all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.

F-

Table of Contents

Accounts Receivable, net
Accounts receivable are presented net of allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provides allowances for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful. Provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices. In determining the provision for invoices not specifically reviewed, the Company analyzes historical collection experience. If the historical data used to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not reflect the Company’s future ability to collect outstanding receivables or if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate, resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments, an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts may be required.
The Company’s accounts receivable have payment terms commensurate with the local business practice depending on the country of sale. The Company generally does not allow returns of products that have been delivered. The Company offers standard quality assurance warranty on its products. 
The Company had no material bad debt expense during the years presented.

Excess and Obsolete Inventory
Most of the Company’s inventory is comprised of finished goods, which is primarily produced by third-party suppliers. Specialized implants, fixation products, biologics, and imaging equipment are determined by utilizing a standard cost method that includes capitalized variances which approximates the weighted average cost. Component parts related to the imaging equipment are valued at weighted average cost. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The Company reviews the components of its inventory on a periodic basis for excess and obsolescence and adjusts inventory to its net realizable value as necessary.
The Company records a lower of cost or net realizable value (“LCNRV”) inventory reserve for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon its expected use of inventory on hand. The Company’s inventory, which consists primarily of specialized implants, fixation products, and biologics is at risk of obsolescence due to the need to maintain substantial levels of inventory. In order to market its products effectively and meet the demands of interoperative product placement, the Company maintains and provides surgeons and hospitals with a variety of inventory products and sizes. For each surgery, fewer than all components will be consumed. The need to maintain and provide a wide variety of inventory causes inventory to be held that is not likely to be used.

The Company’s estimates and assumptions for excess and obsolete inventory are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. The estimates and assumptions are determined primarily based on current usage of inventory and the age of inventory quantities on hand. Additionally, the Company considers recent sales experience to develop assumptions about future demand for its products, while considering product life cycles and new product launches. Increases in the LCNRV reserve for excess and obsolete inventory result in a corresponding charge to cost of sales. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded LCNRV charges for excess and obsolete inventory of 
$
15.4
 million, $
13.6
 million and $
9.8
 million, respectively, net of inventory sold of $
3.4
 million, $
0.2
 million and $
1.5
 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded a reduction of reserve for inventory that was disposed of $
3.5
 million, $
12.9
 million and $
8.2
 million
, respectively.

Table of Contents

Property and Equipment, net
Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, generally ranging from 
three
 to 
seven years
. Leasehold improvements and assets acquired under financing leases are amortized over the shorter of their useful lives or the remaining terms of the related leases.
Operating Lease
The Company determines whether a contract is a lease or contains a lease at inception by assessing whether there is an identified asset and whether the contract conveys the right to control the use of the identified asset in exchange for consideration over a period of time. If both criteria are met, the Company determines the initial classification and measurement of its right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and lease liability at the lease commencement date and thereafter, if modified. The Company recognizes a ROU asset and lease liability for its operating leases with lease terms greater than 12 months. The lease term includes any renewal options and termination options that the Company is reasonably assured to exercise. ROU assets and lease liabilities are based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The present value of operating lease payments is determined by using the incremental borrowing rate of interest that the Company would borrow on a collateralized basis for an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment.

Rent expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the reasonably assured lease term based on the total lease payments and is included in cost of sales, research and development, and sales, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.

The Company aggregates all lease and non-lease components for each class of underlying assets into a single lease component and variable charges for common area maintenance and other variable costs are recognized as expense as incurred. Total variable costs associated with leases were immaterial for all years presented. The Company had an immaterial amount
 of financing leases as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, which is included in property and equipment, net, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
Valuation of Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired from the Company’s business combinations. The determination of the value of goodwill and intangible assets arising from business combinations and asset acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is assessed for impairment using fair value measurement techniques on an annual basis or more frequently if facts and circumstance warrant such a review. Goodwill is considered to be impaired if the Company determines that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its respective fair value.
The Company’s annual evaluation for impairment of goodwill consists of one reporting unit. The Company completed its most recent annual evaluation for impairment of goodwill as of October 1, 2024 and determined that no impairment existed. In addition, no indicators of impairment were noted through December 31, 2024, and consequently 
no
 impairment charge was recorded during the years ended 
December 31, 2024
, 2023 and 2022.

F-

Table of Contents

Valuation of Intangible Assets
Intangible assets are comprised primarily of purchased technology, internally developed software, customer relationships, trade name, trademarks, and in-process research and development. The Company makes significant judgments in relation to the valuation of intangible assets resulting from business combinations and asset acquisitions. Intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of 
2
 to 
12 years
. The Company bases the useful lives and related amortization expense on the period of time it estimates the assets will generate net sales or otherwise be used. The Company also periodically reviews the lives assigned to its intangible assets to ensure that its initial estimates do not exceed any revised estimated periods from which the Company expects to realize cash flows. If a change were to occur in any of the above-mentioned factors or estimates, the likelihood of a material change in the Company’s reported results would increase. The Company evaluates its intangible assets with finite lives for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of the Company’s use of the acquired assets or the strategy for its overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends. If this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired, the Company makes an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life. If this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable, based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset over the remaining amortization period, the Company reduces the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value and may adjust the remaining amortization period. Significant judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow valuation models. It is possible that plans may change and estimates used may prove to be inaccurate. If actual results, or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses, are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets, the Company could incur additional impairment charges. There were 
no
 impairment charges during the years ended December 31, 
2024, 2023 or 2022.

In-process research and development ("IPR&D") and software in development have indefinite lives and are not amortized until the related products reach full commercial launch or when the projects are complete and their assets are ready for their intended use. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are considered to be impaired if the products do not reach commercial launch, if the project is not completed or not completed in a timely manner, or if the related products or projects are no longer technologically feasible. Impairment related to IPR&D and software in development is calculated as the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value. There were 
no
 impairment charges during the years ended December 31, 
2024, 2023
 or 2022.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company assesses potential impairment to its long-lived assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when estimated future undiscounted cash flows related to the asset are less than its carrying amount. Any required impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value and is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset and a charge to operating results. There were 
no
 material impairment charges during the years ended December 31, 
2024, 2023
 or 2022.

Warrants to Purchase Common Stock
Warrants are accounted for in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance as either derivative liabilities or as equity instruments depending on the specific terms of the agreements. All warrants qualify for classification within stockholders' (deficit) equity.

Table of Contents

Fair Value Measurements
The carrying amount of financial instruments consisting of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and short-term debt included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements are reasonable estimates of fair value due to their short maturities.

Authoritative guidance establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:

Level 1:     Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2:     Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

Level 3:     Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue from product sales in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 (“Topic 606”). This standard applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards, such as leases. Under Topic 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of Topic 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer.
Sales are derived primarily from the sale of spinal implant products, imaging equipment, and related services to hospitals and medical centers. Revenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with customers are satisfied, which occurs with the transfer of control of products to customers, either upon shipment of the product or delivery of the product to the customer depending on the shipping terms, or when the products are used in a surgical procedure (implanted in a patient). Revenue from the sale of imaging equipment is recognized as each distinct performance obligation is fulfilled and control transfers to the customer, beginning with shipment or delivery, depending on the contract terms. Revenue from other distinct performance obligations, such as maintenance on imaging equipment and other imaging related services, is recognized in the period the service is performed, and makes up less than 
10
% of the Company’s total revenue. In certain cases, the Company does offer the ability for customers to lease its imaging equipment, but such arrangements are immaterial to total revenue in the years presented. The Company generally does not allow returns of products that have been delivered. Costs incurred by the Company associated directly with sales contracts with customers are deferred over the performance obligation period and recognized in the same period as the related revenue, except for contracts that complete within one year or less, in which case the associated costs are expensed as incurred. Payment terms for sales to customers may vary but are commensurate with the general business practices in the country of sale.

To the extent that the transaction price includes variable consideration, such as discounts, rebates, and customer payment penalties, the Company estimates the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price utilizing either the expected value method or the most likely amount method depending on the nature of the variable consideration. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in the Company’s judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. Estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of the Company’s anticipated performance and all information that is reasonably available, including historical, current, and forecasted information.

Table of Contents

The Company records a contract asset when one or more performance obligations have been completed and revenue has been recognized, but the customer's payment is contingent on the satisfaction of additional performance obligations. The Company records a contract liability, or deferred revenue, when it has an obligation to provide a product or service to the customer and payment is received in advance of its performance. When the Company sells a product or service with a future performance obligation, revenue is deferred on the unfulfilled performance obligation and recognized over the related performance period. Generally, the Company estimates the selling price of promised services included in the equipment sales price using an expected cost plus a margin approach and/or the separately observable price of such service, if available. The transaction price for a contract’s various performance obligations is allocated using the relative standalone selling price method. The use of alternative estimates could result in a different amount of revenue deferral.

Research and Development Expenses
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses consist of costs associated with the design, development, testing, and enhancement of the Company's products. Research and development expenses also include salaries and related employee benefits, research-related overhead expenses, fees paid to external service providers and development consultants in the form of both cash and equity.

Transaction-related Expenses
Transaction-related costs are expensed as incurred. Transaction-related expenses consist of certain costs incurred related primarily to the acquisition and integration of Valence, as defined below.

Product Shipment Cost
Product shipment costs for surgical sets are included in sales, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Product shipment costs total
ed $
21.8
 million
, $
17.3
 million and $
14.8
 million for the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023
 and 2022 respectively.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation expense for equity-classified awards, principally related to restricted stock units ("RSUs") and performance restricted stock units ("PRSUs") is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award. The fair value of equity instruments that are expected to vest is recognized and amortized over the requisite service period. The Company has granted awards with up to 
four year
 graded or cliff vesting terms. No exercise price or other monetary payment is required for receipt of the shares issued in settlement of the respective award; instead, consideration is furnished in the form of the participant’s service.
The fair value of RSUs including PRSUs with pre-defined performance criteria is based on the stock price on the date of grant.
Stock-based compensation recorded in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations is based on awards expected to ultimately vest and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. The Company’s estimated forfeiture rates may differ from its actual forfeitures. The Company considers its historical experience of pre-vesting forfeitures on awards by each homogenous group of employees as the basis to arrive at its estimated annual pre-vesting forfeiture rates.

Table of Contents

The Company estimates the fair value of stock options issued under the Company’s equity incentive plans and shares issued to employees under the Company’s employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model on the date of grant. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model incorporates various assumptions including expected volatility, expected term and risk-free interest rates. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected term of the Company’s stock options and ESPP offering period which is derived from historical experience. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant. The Company has never declared or paid dividends and has no plans to do so in the foreseeable future.
Awards to non-employees are accounted for under the same stock-based compensation provisions as employees, which require that the fair value of these instruments be recognized as an expense when earned. For Development Service Agreements, where the future payments for product and/or intellectual property rights may be paid in either cash or restricted shares of our common stock at the election of the developer, we estimate the fair value of those awards similar to a stock option, using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model on the date of grant. For Development Service Agreements where the future payments for product and/or intellectual property rights will be paid in restricted shares of our common stock, the fair value is based on the stock price on the date of grant. The stock-based compensation expense is recognized as earned once the award is deemed probable of achieving the pre-defined performance criteria. The stock-based compensation expense is included in cost of sales or research and development expense on the consolidated statements of operations commensurate with the nature of the services performed.

Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with provisions which set forth an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. In making such determination, a review of all available positive and negative evidence must be considered, including scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial performance.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of the income tax provision.
Net Loss per Share
Basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the year. If applicable, diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the diluted weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the year determined using the treasury-stock method and the if-converted method for convertible debt. For purposes of this calculation, common stock subject to repurchase by the Company, common stock issuable upon conversion or exercise of convertible notes, preferred shares, options, and warrants are considered to be common stock equivalents and are only included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share when their effect is dilutive. Due to the Company’s net loss position, the effect of including common stock equivalents in the earnings per share calculation is anti-dilutive, and therefore not included.

2. Business Combination
The Company recognizes assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest at fair value at the date of acquisition.

On April 19, 2023, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Integrity Implants Inc. and Fusion Robotics, LLC (collectively, the “Sellers”), whereby the Company acquired certain assets, liabilities, employees, and contracts in connection with the Sellers’ navigation-enabled robotics platform (“Valence”). The Company paid the Sellers cash consideration of $
55.0
 million at closing, which represented the total purchase consideration. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and the Company did not acquire any material assets or assume any material liabilities in connection with the acquisition, excluding intangible assets and goo
dwill. The acquisition is treated as an asset purchase for income tax purposes; therefore, the goodwill recorded is considered deductible for income tax purposes. Refer to Note 4 for further details on intangible assets and goodwill acquired.

6. Debt
Term Loan
On January 6, 2023, the Company entered into a $
150.0
 million term loan credit facility with Braidwell Transaction Holdings, LLC (the “Braidwell Term Loan”). The Braidwell Term Loan provides for an initial term loan of $
100.0
 million which was funded on the closing date. On September 28, 2023, the Company drew an additional $
50.0
 million (the “delayed draw term loan(s)” or the “DDTL”). On October 29, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment of the Braidwell Term Loan, which provides for an additional term loan of $
50.0
 million, subject to the terms of the original term loan credit facility. The Braidwell Term Loan matures on 
January 6, 2028
. As of December 31, 2024, the outstanding balance under the Braidwell Term Loan was $
200.0
 million.
In conjunction with the issuance of the Braidwell Term Loan, the Company incurred $
3.6
 million in debt issuance costs and $
3.5
 million in commitment fees. Commitment fees paid to the lender were accounted for as a debt discount. The debt issuance costs and debt discount were recorded as a direct reduction of the carrying amount of the loan on the consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized over the life of the loan. As of December 31, 2024, debt issuance costs and debt discount, net of accumulated amortization, associated with the Braidwell Term Loan were $
2.5
 million and $
2.9
 million, respectively.

Borrowings under the Braidwell Term Loan bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate for such SOFR business day ("SOFR") subject to a 
3
% floor, plus 
5.75
%.
 The applicable interest rate as of December 31, 2024 was 
10.4
%. The loan agreement includes an undrawn commitment fee, which is calculated as 
1
% per annum of the average daily undrawn portion of the DDTL. Interest and undrawn commitment fees incurred are due quarterly. The Company is also required to pay fees on any prepayment of the Braidwell Term Loan, ranging from 
1.0
% to 
3.0
% depending on the date of prepayment, and a final payment fee equal to 
3.25
% of the principal amount of the loans drawn. The effective interest rate as of December 31, 2024 was 
11.7
%. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized interest expense on the Braidwell Term Loan of $
18.9
 million, which includes $
0.7
 million for the amortization of debt issuance costs and $
0.3
 million for the debt discount. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized interest expense on the Braidwell Term Loan of $
13.2
 million, which includes $
0.4
 million for the amortization of debt issuance costs and $
0.2
 million 
for the debt

discount. 
Upon the Braidwell Term Loan’s maturity, any outstanding principal balance, unpaid accrued interest, and all other obligations under the Braidwell Term Loan will be due and payable.
The Braidwell Term Loan is secured by substantially all of the Company’s assets with the priority interest of the lenders in the Braidwell Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility, as defined below, subject to terms of a customary intercreditor agreement, which provides that the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility have a priority with respect to the Company's accounts receivable, inventory, medical instruments, and items related to the foregoing, and the lenders under the Braidwell Term Loan have priority with respect to the remainder of the Company's assets. The loan agreement contains customary representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants. Under the loan agreement, the Company is required to maintain a minimum level of liquidity. The loan agreement also includes certain events of default, and upon the occurrence of such events of default, all outstanding loans under the Braidwell Term Loan may be accelerated and/or the lenders’ commitments terminated. The Company is in compliance with all required financial covenants as of December 31, 2024.
Revolving Credit Facility
In September 2022, the Company entered into a revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) with entities affiliated with MidCap Financial Trust (“MidCap”). The Revolving Credit Facility originally provided up to $
50.0
 million in borrowing capacity to the Company with an accordion feature up to $
75.0
 million in borrowing capacity, based on a defined borrowing base. The borrowing base is calculated based on certain accounts receivable and inventory assets. The Company subsequently exercised the accordion feature and increased the borrowing capacity by $
25.0
 million up to the full $
75.0
 million borrowing capacity. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on the earlier of 
September 29, 2027
, or 
90
 days prior to the final maturity date of the Company’s 2026 Notes. As of December 31, 2024, the outstanding balance under the Revolving Credit Facility was $
63.3
 million. In January 2025, the Company repaid $
52.8
 million of the outstanding balance.

In conjunction with obtaining the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company incurred $
1.4
 million in debt issuance costs. These costs were capitalized to other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized over the life of the Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, debt issuance costs, net of accumulated amortization, associated with the Revolving Credit Facility 
were $
0.8
 million
 and $
1.0
 million, respectively.

The outstanding loans bear interest at the sum of 
SOFR
 plus 
3.5
% per annum. The interest rate as of December 31, 2024 was 
8.2
%.
 The loan agreements include an unused line fee, which is calculated as 
0.5
% per annum of either the unused Revolving Credit Facility or a minimum balance. Interest and unused line fees incurred are due and capitalized to the outstanding principal balance monthly. The Company recognized interest expense on the Revolving Credit Facility of
 $
3.4
 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $
0.2
 million 
for the amortization of debt issuance costs. The Company recognized interest expense on the Revolving Credit Facility of
 $
2.0
 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, which includes $
0.3
 million 
for the amortization of debt issuance costs. The Company recognized interest expense on the Revolving Credit Facility of $
0.2
 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, which includes $
0.1
 million for the amortization of debt issuance costs. Upon the Revolving Credit Facility’s maturity, any outstanding principal balance, unpaid accrued interest, and all other obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility will be due and payable.

The Revolving Credit Facility contains a lockbox arrangement clause requiring the Company to maintain a lockbox bank account. If the revolving loan availability is less than 
30
% of the revolving loan limit for 
five
 consecutive business days, or the Company is in default, MidCap will apply funds collected from the Company's lockbox account to reduce the outstanding balance of the Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2024, the Company's loan availability level has not activated lockbox deductions, nor is it expected to for the next 12 months; therefore, the Company has determined that the outstanding balance under the Revolving Credit Facility is long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheets.

0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026
In August 2021, the Company issued $
316.3
 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 2026 Notes with a stated interest rate of 
0.75
% and a maturity date of 
August 1, 2026
. 
Interest on the 2026 Notes is payable 
semi-annually
 in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning on 
February 1, 2022
.
 The net proceeds from the sale of the 2026 Notes were approximately $
306.2
 million after deducting the initial purchasers’ offering expenses and before cash used for the privately negotiated capped call transactions (the "Capped Call Transactions"), as described below, the repurchase of stock
, 
and the repayment of the outstanding unsecured term loan with Squadron Medical Finance Solutions, LLC (the “Squadron Medical Term Loan") and outstanding obligation under the Inventory Financing Agreement, as described below. 
The 2026 Notes do not contain any financial covenants
.
The 2026 Notes are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock based upon an initial conversion rate of 
54.5316
 shares of the Company’s common stock per $
1,000
 principal amount of 2026 Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $
18.34
 per share). The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events, including certain distributions and dividends to all or substantially all of the holders of the Company’s common stock. Based on the terms of the 2026 Notes, when a conversion notice is received, the Company has the option to pay or deliver cash, shares of the Company’s common stock, or a combination thereof.
Holders of the 2026 Notes have the right to convert their notes in certain circumstances and during specified periods. Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding February 2, 2026, holders may convert all or a portion of their 2026 Notes only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter (and only during such calendar quarter) commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2021, if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock for at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 
30
 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 
130
% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the 
5
 consecutive business days immediately after any 
10
 consecutive trading day period (the “measurement period”) in which the trading price per $
1,000
 principal amount of 2026 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 
98
% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. From and after 
February 2, 2026
, holders of the 2026 Notes may convert their notes at any time at their election until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. As of December 31, 2024, none of the conditions permitting the holders of the 2026 Notes to convert have been met. The 2026 Notes are classified as long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
The 2026 Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at the Company’s option at any time, and from time to time, on or after 
August 6, 2024
 and on or before the 40th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the 2026 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, but only if the last reported sale price per share of the Company’s common stock exceeds 
130
% of the conversion price for a specified period of time. In addition, calling any of the notes for redemption will constitute a “make-whole fundamental change” with respect to that note, in which case the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of that note will be increased in certain circumstances if such note is converted after it is called for redemption.
If a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date, holders may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their 2026 Notes for cash at a price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. 
No
 principal payments are otherwise due on the 2026 Notes prior to maturity.

The Company recorded the full principal amount of the 2026 Notes as a long-term liability net of deferred issuance costs. The annual effective interest rate for the 2026 Notes is 
1.4
%. The Company recognized interest expense on the 2026 Notes of $
4.4
 million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, which inclu
des $
2.0
 million
 for the amortization of debt issuance costs during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. The Company uses the if-converted method for assumed conversion of the 2026 Notes to compute the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding for diluted earnings per share, if applicable.

Capped Call Transactions
In connection with the offering of the 2026 Notes, the Company entered into the Capped Call Transactions with certain financial institutions. The Capped Call Transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution and/or offset the cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes upon conversion of the 2026 Notes in the event that the market price per share of the Company’s common stock is greater than the strike price of the Capped Call Transactions with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. The Capped Call Transactions have an initial cap price of $
27.68
 per share of the Company’s common stock, which represents a premium of 
100
% over the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock on August 5, 2021, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions. Collectively, the Capped Call Transactions cover, initially, the number of shares of the Company’s common stock underlying the 2026 Notes, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the 2026 Notes. The cost of the Capped Call Transactions was approximately $
39.9
 million.
The Capped Call Transactions are separate transactions and are not part of the terms of the 2026 Notes and will not affect any holder’s rights under the notes. Holders of the 2026 Notes will not have any rights with respect to the Capped Call Transactions.
The Capped Call Transactions meet all of the applicable criteria for equity classification and, as a result, the related $
39.9
 million cost was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on the Company’s consolidated statements of shareholders’ (deficit) equity for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Other Debt Agreements
The Company has 
two
 loan agreements under French government sponsored COVID-19 relief initiatives (“PGE” loans) which mature in 2027. Monthly and quarterly installments of principal and interest under each PGE loan agreement is due until the original principal amounts and applicable interest is fully repaid in 2027. The outstanding obligation under each loan as of December 31, 2024 w
as $
2.1
 million and $
0.9
 million
 at weighted average interest rates of 
0.95
% and 
1.25
%, respectively, and weighted average costs of the state guaranty of 
0.68
% and 
1.0
%, respectively.

7. Commitments and Contingencies
Leases
The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception by assessing whether there is an identified asset and whether the contract conveys the right to control the use of the identified asset in exchange for consideration over a period of time. If both criteria are met, the Company records the associated lease liability and corresponding ROU asset upon commencement of the lease using a discount rate based on the incremental borrowing rate of interest that the Company would borrow on a collateralized basis for an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. 
Any short-term leases defined as twelve months or less or month-to-month leases are excluded and are expensed each month. Total costs associated with these short-term leases are immaterial to all periods presented.

10
 years and generally provide for periodic rent increases. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material variable lease payments, residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. 
The Company aggregates all lease and non-lease components for each class of underlying assets into a single lease component and variable charges for common area maintenance and other variable costs are recognized as expense as incurred. Total variable costs associated with leases for the year ended December 31, 2024 were immaterial. The Company had an immaterial amount of financing leases as of December 31, 2024, which is included in property and equipment, net, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities, on the consolidated balance sheets.

Litigation
The Company is and may become involved in various legal proceedings arising from its business activities. While management is not aware of any litigation matter that in and of itself would have a material adverse impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position, litigation is inherently unpredictable, and depending on the nature and timing of a proceeding, an unfavorable resolution could materially affect the Company’s future consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position in a particular period. The Company assesses contingencies to determine the degree of probability and range of possible loss for potential accrual or disclosure in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. An estimated loss contingency is accrued in the Company’s consolidated financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Because litigation is inherently unpredictable and unfavorable resolutions could occur, assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. When evaluating contingencies, the Company may be unable to provide a meaningful estimate due to a number of factors, including the procedural status of the matter in question, the presence of complex or novel legal theories, and/or the ongoing discovery and development of information important to the matters. In addition, damage amounts claimed in litigation against the Company may be unsupported, exaggerated or unrelated to reasonably possible outcomes, and as such are not meaningful indicators of the Company’s potential liability.
Indemnifications
In the normal course of business, the Company enters into agreements under which it occasionally indemnifies third-parties for intellectual property infringement claims or claims arising from breaches of representations or warranties. In addition, from time to time, the Company provides indemnity protection to third-parties for claims relating to past performance arising from undisclosed liabilities, product liabilities, environmental obligations, representations and warranties, and other claims. In these agreements, the scope and amount of remedy, or the period in which claims can be made, may be limited. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of future payments, if any, due under these indemnities due to the conditional nature of the obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each agreement.
In October 2017, NuVasive, Inc. filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court against Mr. Miles, the Company’s Chairman and CEO, who was a former officer and board member of NuVasive. The Company itself was not initially a named defendant in this lawsuit; however, in June 2018, NuVasive amended its complaint to add the Company as a defendant. In October 2018, the Delaware Court ordered that NuVasive advance legal fees for Mr. Miles’ defense in the lawsuit, as well as Mr. Miles’ legal fees incurred in pursuing advancement of his fees, pursuant to an indemnification agreement between NuVasive and Mr. Miles. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has not recorded any liability on the consolidated balance sheets related to this matter.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In 2007, the Company adopted the ESPP. On June 14, 2023, the Company’s shareholders approved a third amendment to the ESPP which increased the number of shares of common stock available for purchase under the ESPP by 
1,500,000
 shares, resulting in total common stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP of 
3,637,449
 shares. As of December 31, 2024, 
approximately 
714,000
 shares
 were available under the ESPP for future issuance.
The ESPP provides eligible employees with a means of acquiring equity in the Company at a discounted purchase price using their own accumulated payroll deductions. Under the terms of the ESPP, employees can elect to have up to 
20
% of their annual compensation, up to a maximum of $
21,250
 per year, withheld to purchase shares of Company common stock for a purchase price equal to 
85
% of the lower of the fair market value per share (at closing) of Company common stock on (i) the commencement date of the 
six-month
 offering period or (ii) the respective purchase date.
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 there were approximately 
529,000
, 
375,000

and 
429,000
 shares of common stock, issued under the ESPP, respectively. The Company recogniz
ed $
2.2
 million
, $
1.7
 million and $
1.6
 million in expense related to the ESPP for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The Company estimates the fair value of shares issued to employees under the ESPP using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock purchase rights under the ESPP are as follows:

The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the Company’s ability to generate sufficient taxable income in future years in the associated jurisdiction to which the deferred tax assets relate. As of December 31, 2024, a valuation allowance of
 $
246.7
 million has been established against the deferred tax assets, as the Company has determined that it is currently not likely that these assets will be realized. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the valuation allowance increased by
 $
35.3
 million, $
43.6
 million and $
39.4
 million, respectively.
In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial performance. Based on the review of all positive and negative evidence, including a 
three-year
 cumulative pretax loss, the Company determined that a full valuation allowance should be recorded against its deferred tax assets, with the exception of the net indefinite lived deferred tax liabilities and the Company’s Texas Temporary Credit for Business Loss Carryforwards.

5.6
 million, respectively, of the Company’s total unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would impact the effective income tax rate.

In accordance with the disclosure requirements as described in ASC Topic 740, 
Income Taxes
, the Company classifies uncertain tax positions as non-current income tax liabilities unless they are expected to be paid within one year. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters as a component of the income tax provision. As of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, there wer
e $
0.18
 million
, $
0.1
 million and $
0.04
 million in accrued interest and penalties, respectively.

The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examination by tax authorities in major jurisdictions for years prior to 2020. However, to the extent allowed by law, the taxing authorities may have the right to examine prior periods where net operating losses and tax credits were generated and carried forward and make adjustments up to the amount of the carryforwards. The Company is not currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service, foreign or state and local tax authorities.
At December 31, 2024, the Company had federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards
 of $
604.6
 million, $
483.1
 million and $
119.1
 million,
 respectively. 
Federal and state net operating losses generated after December 31, 2017 of $
467.3
 million and $
94.6
 million, respectively, can be carried forward indefinitely.
 The remaining federal and state net operating losses begin expiring at various dates begin
ning in 2025 through 
2044
, 
while foreign net operating losses in France carryforward indefinitely. At December 31, 2024, the Company had federal and state research and development tax cre
dit carryforwards of $
9.0
 million and $
7.8
 million, respectively. 
The federal research and development tax credits begin expiring in 
2042
 and the state research and development tax credits do not have an expiration date and may be carried forward indefinitely. At December 31, 2024, the Company also had interest expense carryovers of $
87.5
 million which can be carried forward indefinitely. Utilization of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may become subject to annual limitations due to ownership change limitations that could occur in the future as provided by Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”), as well as similar state provisions. These ownership changes may limit the amount of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income if the Company experiences a cumulative change in ownership of more than 
50
% within a 
three-year
 testing period. The Company completed formal study through the year ended December 31, 2018 and determined ownership changes within the meaning of IRC Section 382 had occurred. The Company adjusted federal tax attribute carry forwards and deferred tax assets accordingly. The Company will make adjustments to the fully reserved attributes as further studies are completed.
