Item 3:     Legal Proceedings
SEC regulations require us to disclose certain information about proceedings arising under federal, state or local environmental provisions if we reasonably believe that such proceedings may result in monetary sanctions above a stated threshold. Pursuant to the SEC regulations, Itron uses a threshold of $1 million or more for purposes of determining whether disclosure of any such environmental proceedings is required.
In conjunction with the Actaris S.p.A. (Actaris) acquisition in April 2007, Itron assumed Actaris's environmental cleanup liability and the related legal recourse for the Frosinone site in Italy. This site was originally owned and operated by Schlumberger before Schlumberger contributed it to Actaris in the course of the spin-off of Actaris from Schlumberger Industries S.p.A on August 1, 2001. 
Since 2001, Schlumberger has fully reimbursed Actaris and Itron, as successor to Actaris's interests, for the Frosinone site remediation costs pursuant to an indemnification agreement.
 In December 2022, Itron was presented with a remediation plan, which addressed the water contamination issues, with an estimated cost of $1.9 million. 
Due to increased remediation work and costs associated with the required cleanup activities, Itron recognized an additional $0.9 million in costs during the fourth quarter of 2023. The remediation plan proposal was approved by the Italian Authorities Higher Institute of Health (ISS) in September 2024. Itron recognized an additional $0.6 million in costs during the fourth quarter of 2024 related to the increase in forecasted provision required by the approved plan. Schlumberger, pursuant to the indemnification agreement, reimburses Itron for all remediation costs. 
In 2007-2008, Itron acquired an industrial site located at 1310 Emerald Road, Greenwood, South Carolina. Previous site owners used various chlorinated solvents and potential contaminants at the site. In 2013, Itron entered into a voluntary cleanup contract with the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC). Itron completed that process in 2019. In October 2021, DHEC sent Itron and three other potentially responsible parties (PRPs) a proposed site remediation plan with an estimated cost of $3.7 million. Itron objected to the proposed plan at a public hearing on November 4, 2021, and again in a letter to DHEC dated January 13, 2022. Given that the contamination arose from activities prior to Itron's ownership of the property and past remediation efforts, Itron has disputed its responsibility for any alleged contamination and suggested alternative proposals. Itron will continue to seek a reasonable resolution with DHEC and the other PRPs.

Item 7:    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis compares the change in the consolidated financial statements for fiscal years 2024 and 2023 and should be read in conjunction with Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. For comparisons of fiscal years 2023 and 2022, see our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on February 26, 2024, and incorporated herein by reference.
The objective of Management's Discussion and Analysis is to provide our assessment of the financial condition and results of operations, including an evaluation of our liquidity and capital resources along with material events occurring during the year. The discussion and analysis focuses on material events and uncertainties known to management that are reasonably likely to cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future operating results or of future financial condition. In addition, we address matters that are reasonably likely, based on management's assessment, to have a material impact on future operations. We expect the analysis will enhance a reader's understanding of our financial condition, cash flows, and other changes in financial condition and results of operations. 
Overview
We are a technology, solutions, and service company, and we are a leader in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). We offer solutions that enable utilities and municipalities to safely, securely, and reliably operate their critical infrastructure. Our solutions include the deployment of smart networks, software, services, devices, sensors, and data analytics that allow our customers to manage assets, secure revenue, lower operational costs, improve customer service, improve safety, and enable efficient management of valuable resources. Our comprehensive solutions and data analytics address the unique challenges facing the energy, water, and municipality sectors, including increasing demand on resources, non-technical loss, leak detection, environmental and regulatory compliance, and improved operational reliability. 
We operate under the Itron brand worldwide and manage and report under three operating segments: Device Solutions, Networked Solutions, and Outcomes. The product and operating definitions of the three segments are as follows:
Device Solutions – 
This segment primarily includes hardware products used for measurement, control, or sensing that can have communications capability embedded for use with our broader Itron systems, i.e., hardware-based products that may be part of a complete end-to-end solution. Examples from the Device Solutions portfolio include: standard endpoints that are shipped without Itron communications, such as our standard electricity, gas, and water meters for a variety of global markets and adhering to regulations and standards within those markets, as well as our heat and allocation products; communicating meters that may be sold as part of an Itron end-to-end solution and designed to meet market requirements; and the implementation and installation of communicating and non-communicating devices.
Networked Solutions – 
This segment primarily includes a combination of communicating devices (e.g., smart meters, modules, endpoints, and sensors), network infrastructure, network design services, and associated head-end management and application software designed and sold as a complete solution for acquiring and transporting robust application-specific data. Networked Solutions includes products and software for the implementation, installation, and management of communicating devices and data networks. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) solutions supported by this segment include automated meter reading (AMR); advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) for electricity, water, and gas; distributed energy resource management (DERMs); grid edge devices; distribution automation communications; smart street lighting; smart city sensors and applications; and leak detection and applications for both gas and water systems. Our IIoT platform allows utility and smart city applications to be run and managed on a flexible multi-purpose network.
Outcomes – 
This segment primarily includes our value-added, enhanced software and services in which we enable grid edge intelligence and manage, organize, analyze, and interpret raw, anonymized data using artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistical modeling, and other analytics. This allows us to help utilities improve decision making, maximize operational profitability, engage consumers, enhance resource efficiency, improve grid resiliency and reliability, and deliver value for utilities and smart cities. Outcomes supports high-value use cases, such as data management, grid operations, distributed intelligence, AMI operations, gas distribution and safety, water operations management, revenue assurance, DERMs, energy forecasting, consumer engagement, smart payment, and fleet energy resource management. Utilities leverage these outcomes to unlock the capabilities of their networks and devices, improve the productivity of their workforce, increase the reliability of their operations, manage and optimize the proliferation of distributed energy resources (DERs), address grid complexity, and enhance the customer experience. Revenue from these offerings are primarily recurring in nature and would include any direct management of Device Solutions, Networked Solutions, and other third-parties' products on behalf of our end customers.

Table of Contents
We have three measures of segment performance: revenues, gross profit (margin), and operating income (margin). Intersegment revenues are minimal. Certain operating expenses are allocated to the operating segments based upon internally established allocation methodologies. Interest income, interest expense, other income (expense), the income tax provision (benefit), and certain corporate operating expenses are neither allocated to the segments nor included in the measures of segment performance.
Non-GAAP Measures
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), we use certain adjusted or non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS), adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, and constant currency. We provide these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe they provide greater transparency and represent supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. We exclude certain costs in our non-GAAP financial measures as we believe the net result is a measure of our core business. We believe these measures facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period by eliminating potential differences caused by the existence and timing of certain expense items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. Non-GAAP performance measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, results prepared in accordance with GAAP. We strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Our non-GAAP financial measures may be different from those reported by other companies.
In our discussions of the operating results below, we may refer to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which are references to the differences between the foreign currency exchange rates we use to convert operating results from local currencies into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. We also use the term "constant currency", which represents results adjusted to exclude foreign currency exchange rate impacts. We calculate the constant currency change as the difference between the current period results translated using the current period currency exchange rates and the comparable prior period's results restated using current period currency exchange rates. We believe the reconciliations of changes in constant currency provide useful supplementary information to investors in light of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
Refer to the 
Non-GAAP Measures
 section below on pages 43-46 for information about these non-GAAP measures and the detailed reconciliation of items that impacted non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow in the periods presented.

Amendment to the 2018 credit facility
We entered into our credit facility on January 5, 2018 (the 2018 credit facility). On June 14, 2024, we entered into an eighth amendment of the 2018 credit facility. In contemplation of the issuance of the 2024 convertible notes, this amendment to the Credit Agreement removed the $500 million maximum amount of convertible notes we could offer. Refer to Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 6: Debt for further details.
Convertible Notes
On June 21, 2024, we closed the sale of $805 million of convertible notes (the 2024 Notes) in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers, resulting in net proceeds to us of $784 million. The 2024 Notes accrue interest at a rate of 1.375% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on January 15, 2025. The 2024 Notes mature on July 15, 2030, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed, or converted in accordance with their terms. Refer to Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 6: Debt, and Note 14: Shareholders' Equity for further details.
Business Acquisition
On March 1, 2024, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the shares of Elpis2, Inc. (Elpis Squared), a privately held software and services company. This acquisition provides value to Itron through the leverage of Elpis Squared's utility grid analytics, services, and operational software platforms to enhance Itron's Outcomes offerings. The acquisition was deemed a business acquisition. The sales, results of operations, and acquisition-related costs associated with the acquisition were not material. The purchase price for this acquisition is $34.1 million
. The purchase price was allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, primarily 
$15.0 million
 in finite-lived intangible assets and 
$19.3 million
 in goodwill. Since
 this was a stock acquisition, none of the goodwill is deductible for tax purposes. 
The purchase w

Definition of an Endpoint Under Management
An "endpoint under management" is a unique endpoint, or data from that endpoint, which Itron manages via our networked platform or a third party's platform that is connected to one or multiple types of endpoints. Itron's management of an endpoint occurs when on behalf of our client, we manage one or more of the physical endpoints, operating system, data, application, data analytics, and/or outcome deriving from this unique endpoint. Itron has the ability to monitor and/or manage endpoints or the data from the endpoints via Network-as-a-Service (NaaS), Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), and/or a licensed offering at a remote location designated by our client. Our offerings typically, but not exclusively, provide an Itron product or Itron certified partner product to our clients that has the capability of one-way communication or two-way communication of data that may include remote product configuration and upgradability. Examples of these offerings include our Temetra, OpenWay®, OpenWay® Riva and Gen X.
This metric primarily includes Itron or third-party endpoints deployed within the electricity, water, and gas utility industries, as well as within cities and municipalities around the globe. Endpoints under management also include smart communication modules and network interface cards (NICs) within Itron's platforms. At times, these NICs are communicating modules that 
30
Table of Contents
were sold separately from an Itron product directly to our customers or to third party manufacturers for use in endpoints such as electric, water, and gas meters; streetlights and other types of IIoT sensors and actuators; sensors and other capabilities that the end customer would like Itron to connect and manage on its behalf.
The endpoints under management metric only accounts for the specific, unique endpoint itself, though that endpoint may have multiple applications, services, outcomes, and higher margin recurring offerings associated with it. This metric does not reflect the multi-application value that can be derived from the individual endpoint itself. Additionally, this metric excludes those endpoints that are non-communicating, non-Itron system hardware component sales or licensed applications for which Itron does not manage the unit or the data from that unit directly.
While the one-time sale of the platform and endpoints is primarily delivered via our Networked Solutions segment, our enhanced solutions, on-going monitoring, maintenance, software, analytics, and distributed intelligent applications are predominantly recognized in our Outcomes segment. We anticipate the opportunity to increase our penetration of Outcomes applications, software, and managed applications will increase as our endpoints under management increases. Management believes using the endpoints under management metric enhances insight of the strategic and operational direction of our Networked Solutions and Outcomes segments to serve clients for years following their one-time installation of an endpoint.
A summary of our endpoints under management is as follows:

Operating expenses decreased $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared with the same period in 2023. This was primarily the result of a $41.3 million decrease in restructuring costs, as well as a $1.1 million decrease in amortization of intangible assets. The decrease was partially offset by $26.3 million increase in sales, general and administrative expenses and a $6.3 million increase in research and development expenses. The increases in sales, general and administrative and research and development expenses were primarily driven by increased labor costs. Refer to Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 4: Intangible Assets and Liabilities, and Note 13: Restructuring for more details.

Total other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2024 was net income of $20.4 million compared with net expense of $1.5 million in 2023. The net increase was driven by a $25.3 million increase in interest income primarily due to interest earned from the cash proceeds of the 2024 Notes, as well increased other income due to a $3.1 million foreign currency loss recognized in 2023 compared with a gain of $1.1 million in 2024. This increase was offset by an increase in other interest expense driven by a $5.8 million interest accrual for the 2024 Notes recognized in 2024 and a $1.8 million increase in amortization of prepaid debt fees.
Income Tax Provision
Our income tax expense was $43.4 million and $29.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. Our tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2024 differed from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21% due to changes in valuation allowances, the level of profit or losses in domestic and international jurisdictions, stock-based compensation, tax credits, settlement of tax audits, and uncertain tax positions.

Revenues increased $46.6 million, or 17%, in 2024 compared with 2023. This increase was driven by software licenses, services, and the Elpis Squared acquisition. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted revenues by $0.5 million.
Gross Margin
Gross margin decreased to 37.6% in 2024 compared with 40.5% for last year. The 290 basis point decrease was driven by increased services cost and mix in the current period.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses increased $8.4 million, or 15%, in 2024 compared with 2023. This was primarily related to increased product development investment.
Corporate unallocated
Operating expenses not directly associated with an operating segment are classified as Corporate unallocated. These expenses decreased $18.3 million in 2024 as compared with 2023. This was due to a decrease of $41.3 million in restructuring, as well as a $1.1 million decrease in amortization of intangible assets. The decreases were partially offset by a $23.5 million increase in sales, general and administrative expenses as compared with 2023. The increase in sales, general, and administrative expenses was primarily driven by increased labor costs.

Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2024 was $1.05 billion compared with $302.0 million at December 31, 2023. The $749.2 million increase in cash and cash equivalents in the 2024 period was primarily the net proceeds provided by the 2024 convertible notes issuance and net cash provided by operating activities as a result of higher earnings, partially offset by cash used in investing activities for the acquisition of Elpis Squared and a slight increase in cash paid for acquisition of property, plant, and equipment.
35
Table of Contents
Operating activities
Cash provided by operating activities in 2024 was $113.2 million higher than in 2023. This increase was primarily due to increased earnings and working capital conversion, partially offset by higher restructuring and variable compensation payments in 2024.
Investing activities
Net cash used in investing activities in 2024 was $63.4 million, compared with net cash used in investing activities in 2023 of $23.3 million. This movement was primarily related to net cash used for the acquisition of Elpis Squared for $34.1 million along with $3.7 million increased purchases of property, plant, and equipment in 2024.
Financing activities
Net cash provided by financing activities during 2024 was $579.6 million, compared with $3.5 million used in 2023. In 2024, cash provided by financing activities is due primarily to the issuance of the 2024 convertible notes, net of total debt issuance cost, totaling $784 million, partially offset by the purchase of the capped call for the convertible offering of $109.0 million and common stock repurchased totaling $100.0 million.
Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents
The effect of exchange rates on the cash balances of currencies held in foreign denominations resulted in a decrease of $5.1 million in 2024 and an increase of $1.9 million in 2023. Our foreign currency exposure relates to non-U.S. dollar denominated balances in our international subsidiary operations.
Free cash flow (Non-GAAP)
To supplement our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use the non-GAAP measure of free cash flow to analyze cash flows generated from our operations. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We calculate free cash flows, using amounts from our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, as follows:

Free cash flow increased due to higher operating cash flow, partially offset by higher spending for property, plant, and equipment. See the cash flow discussion of operating and investing activities above.
Off-balance sheet arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet financing agreements or guarantees as defined by Item 303 of Regulation S-K at December 31, 2024 and 2023 that we believe could reasonably likely have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, borrowings, and the sale of our common stock. Cash flows may fluctuate and are sensitive to many factors including changes in working capital and the timing and magnitude of capital expenditures and payments of debt. Working capital, which represents current assets less current liabilities, continues to be in a net favorable position. We expect existing cash, cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments, such as material capital expenditures and debt obligations, for at least the next 12 months and into the foreseeable future.
Borrowings
We originally entered into our credit facility on January 5, 2018 (together with the subsequent eight amendments, the 2018 credit facility). The 2018 credit facility provides a multicurrency revolving line of credit (the revolver) with a principal amount of up to $500 million. The revolver also contains a $300 million standby letter of credit sub-facility and a $50 million swingline sub-facility. At December 31, 2024, no amount was outstanding under the 2018 credit facility, and $46.0 million was utilized by outstanding standby letters of credit, resulting in $454.0 million available for borrowing. At December 31, 2024, 
36
Table of Contents
$254.0 million was available for additional standby letters of credit under the letter of credit sub-facility, and no amounts were outstanding under the swingline sub-facility. Amounts borrowed under the revolver may be repaid and reborrowed until the revolver's maturity on October 18, 2026, at which time all outstanding loans together with all accrued and unpaid interest must be repaid. However, that date may be advanced to December 14, 2025 if Itron does not settle or extend a sufficient portion of the outstanding 2021 convertible notes, as detailed in the seventh amendment.
On March 12, 2021, we closed the sale of $460 million in convertible notes (the 2021 Notes) in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers. These convertible notes do not bear regular interest, and the principal amount does not accrete. The convertible notes will mature on March 15, 2026, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed, or converted in accordance with their terms.
On June 21, 2024, we closed the sale of $805 million in convertible notes (the 2024 Notes) in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers. These convertible notes accrue interest at a rate of 1.375% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on January 15, 2025. The notes will mature on July 15, 2030, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed, or converted in accordance with their terms.

Restructuring
On October 29, 2021, our Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan (the 2021 Projects), which in conjunction with the 
announcement of 
the sale of certain Gas product lines from our Device Solutions manufacturing and business operations in Europe and North America to Dresser Utility Solutions, includes activities to drive reductions in certain locations and functional support areas. These pro
jects were substantially complete at the end of 2024, with an estimated 
$12.8 million
 in cash payments remaining as of 
December 31, 2024 with cash outflows expected through 2027.
On February 23, 2023, our Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan (the 2023 Projects). The 2023 Projects include activities that continue Itron's efforts to optimize its global supply chain and manufacturing operations, sales and marketing organizations, and other overhead. These projects are expected to be substantially complete by early 2025, with an estimated $28.5 million in cash payments remaining as of December 31, 2024 with cash outflows expected through 2027.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, we paid out $32.0 million related to all our restructuring projects. As of December 31, 2024, $41.3 million was accrued for these restructuring projects, of which $24.3 million is expected to be paid within the next 12 months. 
For further details regarding our restructuring activities, refer to Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 13: Restructuring.
Stock Repurchase Programs
Effective September 19, 2024, Itron's Board of Directors authorized a repurchase up to $100 million of our common stock over an 18-month period (the 2024 Stock Repurchase Program). The repurchase program is intended to comply with Rule 10b-18 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We repurchased no shares under the 2024 Stock Repurchase Program. 
Other contractual obligations and commitments
Operating lease obligations are disclosed in Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 19: Leases and do not include common area maintenance charges, real estate taxes, and insurance charges for which we are obligated. Amounts due under operating lease liabilities during 2025 are $15.9 million and are $27.6 million for 2026 and beyond.
We regularly enter into standard purchase orders in the ordinary course of business that may obligate us to purchase materials and other items but may not yet qualify for recognition in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Purchase orders and other purchase obligations can include open-ended agreements that provide for estimated quantities over an extended delivery period. At December 31, 2024, purchase orders and other purchase obligations were $641.4 million, which includes capital expenditures of $13.0 million. The purchase orders may include durations longer than one year, but these long-term agreements generally 
37

contain termination clauses that could require payment if the commitments were canceled, and as such the total above is considered short-term as of December 31, 2024.
Other long-term liabilities consist of warranty obligations, estimated pension benefit payments, and other obligations. Estimated pension benefit payments include amounts to be paid from our assets for unfunded plans and reflect expected future service. The following table summarizes our known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2024.

The period of cash settlement for long-term unrecognized tax benefits, which include accrued interest and penalties, cannot be reasonably estimated with the respective taxing authorities. For further information on defined benefit pension plans, income taxes, warranty obligations, and unearned revenue for extended warranties, refer to Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 8: Defined Benefit Pension Plans, Note 11: Income Taxes, Note 12: Commitments and Contingencies, and Note 17: Revenues.
Income Tax
Our tax provision as a percentage of income before tax typically differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21%. Changes in our actual tax rate are subject to several factors, including fluctuations in operating results, new or revised tax legislation and accounting pronouncements, changes in the level of business in domestic and foreign jurisdictions, research and development tax credits, state income taxes, adjustments to valuation allowances, settlement of tax audits, and uncertain tax positions, among other items. Changes in tax laws, valuation allowances, and unanticipated tax liabilities could significantly impact our tax rate.

Based on current projections, we expect to pay, net of refunds, approximately $67 million in U.S. federal and state taxes and $14 million in foreign and local income taxes in 2025.
As of December 31, 2024, there was $46.1 million of cash and short-term investments held by certain foreign subsidiaries in which we are permanently reinvested for tax purposes. As a result of recent changes in U.S. tax legislation, any repatriation in the future would not result in U.S. federal income tax. Accordingly, there is no provision for U.S. deferred taxes on this cash. If this cash were repatriated to fund U.S. operations, additional withholding tax costs may be incurred. Tax is only one of the many factors that we consider in the management of global cash. Accordingly, the amount of taxes that we would need to accrue and pay to repatriate foreign cash could vary significantly.
Other Liquidity Considerations
In certain of our consolidated international subsidiaries, we have joint venture partners who are minority shareholders. Although these entities are not wholly-owned by Itron, Inc., we consolidate them because we have a greater than 50% ownership interest and/or because we exercise control over the operations. The noncontrolling interest balance in our Consolidated Balance Sheets represents the proportional share of the equity of the joint venture entities, which is attributable to the minority shareholders. At December 31, 2024, $3.6 million of our consolidated cash balance was held in our joint venture entities. As a result, the minority shareholders of these entities have rights to their proportional share of this cash balance, and there may be limitations on our ability to repatriate cash to the United States from these entities.
As of December 31, 2024, we expect to make cash payments of approximately $64 million for variable compensation during the first quarter of 2025.

Table of Contents
General Liquidity Overview
We expect to grow through a combination of internal new research and development, licensing technology from and to others, distribution agreements, partnering arrangements, and acquisitions of technology or other companies. We expect these activities to be funded with existing cash, cash flow from operations, borrowings, or the sale of our common stock or other securities. We believe existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our existing operations and obligations for the next 12 months and into the foreseeable future, but offer no assurances. Our liquidity could be affected by the stability of the electricity, gas, and water utility industries, competitive pressures, our dependence on certain key vendors and components, changes in estimated liabilities for product warranties and/or litigation, supply constraints, future business combinations, capital market fluctuations, international risks, and other factors described under Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors, as well as Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
Contingencies
Refer to Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 12:

Commitments and Contingencies.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management's application of accounting policies. Our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition, warranty, restructuring, income taxes, goodwill and intangible assets, defined benefit pension plans, contingencies, and stock-based compensation. Refer to Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further disclosures regarding accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements.
Revenue Recognition
Many of our revenue arrangements involve multiple performance obligations, consisting of hardware, software, and professional services such as implementation, project management, installation, consulting services, cloud services, and SaaS. These arrangements require us to determine the standalone selling price of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation and then allocate the total arrangement consideration among the separate performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling price. Revenues for each performance obligation are then recognized upon transfer of control to the customer at a point in time as products are shipped or received by a customer, or over time as services are delivered. The majority of our revenue is recognized at a point in time when products are shipped to or received by a customer. Certain contracts that contain multiple performance obligations may contain customer-specific terms and conditions that govern service level commitments, transfer of control, and variable consideration that may involve complex accounting considerations.
Professional services revenues are recognized over time. We measure progress towards satisfying these performance obligations using input methods, most commonly based on the costs incurred in relation to the total expected costs to provide the service. The estimate of expected costs to provide services requires judgment. Cost estimates take into consideration past history and the specific scope requested by the customer and are updated quarterly. Other variables impacting our estimate of costs to complete include length of time to complete, changes in wages, subcontractor performance, supplier information, and business volume assumptions. Changes in underlying assumptions and estimates may adversely or favorably affect financial performance.
If we estimate that the completion of a performance obligation will result in a loss, then the loss is recognized in the period in which the loss becomes evident. We reevaluate the estimated loss through the completion of the performance obligation and adjust the estimated loss for changes in facts and circumstances.
Many of our contracts with customers include variable consideration, which can include liquidated damage provisions, rebates and volume and early payment discounts, or software licenses sold where the amount of consideration is dependent on the number of endpoints deployed. We estimate variable consideration using the expected value method, taking into consideration contract terms, historical customer behavior, and historical sales. Some of our contracts with customers contain clauses for liquidated damages related to the timing of delivery or milestone accomplishments, which could become material in the event of failure to meet the contractual deadlines. At the inception of the arrangement and on an ongoing basis, we evaluate the probability of having to pay liquidated damages and the magnitude of such damages. In the case of liquidated damages, we also take into consideration progress towards meeting contractual milestones, including whether milestones have not been achieved, specified rates, if applicable, stated in the contract, and history of paying liquidated damages to the customer or similar customers.
Certain of our revenue arrangements include an extended or customer-specific warranty provision that covers all or a portion of a customer's replacement or repair costs beyond the standard warranty period. Whether or not the extended warranty is 
39
Table of Contents
separately priced in the arrangement, a portion of the arrangement's total consideration is allocated to this extended warranty deliverable. This revenue is deferred and recognized over the extended warranty coverage period. Extended or customer-specific warranties do not represent a significant portion of our revenue.
We allocate consideration to each performance obligation in an arrangement based on its relative standalone selling price. For goods or services where we have observable standalone sales, the observable standalone sales are used to determine the standalone selling price. For the majority of our goods and services, we do not have observable standalone sales. As a result, we estimate the standalone selling price using either the adjusted market assessment approach or the expected cost plus a margin approach. Approaches used to estimate the standalone selling price for a given good or service maximize the use of observable inputs and consider several factors, including our pricing practices, costs to provide a good or service, the type of good or service, and availability of other transactional data, among others.
We determine the estimated standalone selling prices of goods or services used in our allocation of arrangement consideration on an annual basis or more frequently if there is a significant change in our business or if we experience significant variances in our transaction prices.
Our contracts may be modified to add, remove, or change existing performance obligations or change the contract price. The accounting for modifications to our contracts involves assessing whether the products or services added to an existing contract are distinct and whether the pricing is at the standalone selling price. Products or services added that are not distinct are accounted for as if it were part of the existing contract. The effect of the modification on the transaction price and on the measure of progress is recognized as an adjustment to revenue as of the date of the modification (i.e., on a cumulative catch-up basis). Those products or services that are distinct are accounted for prospectively, either as a separate contract if the additional services are priced at the standalone selling price, or as a termination of the existing contract and creation of a new contract if not priced at the standalone selling price.
Warranty
We offer standard warranties on our hardware products and large application software products. We accrue the estimated cost of product warranties based on historical and projected product performance trends and costs during the warranty period. Testing of new products in the development stage helps identify and correct potential warranty issues prior to manufacturing. Quality control efforts during manufacturing reduce our exposure to warranty claims. When testing or quality control efforts fail to detect a fault in our products, we may experience an increase in warranty claims. We track warranty claims to identify potential warranty trends. If an unusual trend is identified, an additional warranty accrual would be recognized if a failure event is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. When new products are introduced, our process relies on historical averages of similar products until sufficient data are available. As actual experience on new products becomes available, it is used to modify the historical averages to ensure the expected warranty costs are within a range of likely outcomes. Management regularly evaluates the sufficiency of the warranty provisions and makes adjustments when necessary. The warranty allowances may fluctuate due to changes in estimates for material, labor, and other costs we may incur to repair or replace projected product failures, and we may incur additional warranty and related expenses in the future with respect to new or established products, which could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. 
Restructuring
We recognize a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity under a restructuring project at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred. Employee termination benefits considered post-employment benefits are accrued when the obligation is probable and estimable, such as benefits stipulated by human resource policies and practices or statutory requirements. If the employee must provide future service, such benefits are recognized ratably over the future service period. For contract termination costs, we recognize a liability upon the later of when we terminate a contract in accordance with the contract terms or when we cease using the rights conveyed by the contract, whichever occurs later.
Asset impairments associated with a restructuring project are determined at the asset group level. An impairment may be recognized for assets that are to be abandoned, are to be sold for less than net book value, or are held for sale in which the estimated proceeds are less than the net book value less costs to sell. We may also recognize impairment on an asset group, which is held and used, when the carrying value is not recoverable and exceeds the asset group's fair value. If an asset group is considered a business, a portion of our goodwill balance is allocated to it based on relative fair value. If the sale of an asset group under a restructuring project results in proceeds that exceed the net book value of the asset group, the resulting gain is recognized within restructuring expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
In determining restructuring charges, we analyze our future operating requirements, including the required headcount by business functions and facility space requirements. Our restructuring costs and any resulting accruals involve significant estimates using the best information available at the time the estimates are made. Our estimates involve a number of risks and 
40
Table of Contents
uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control, including real estate market conditions and local labor and employment laws, rules, and regulations. If the amounts and timing of cash flows from restructuring activities are significantly different from what we have estimated, the actual amount of restructuring and asset impairment charges could be materially different, either higher or lower, than those we have recognized.
Income Taxes
We estimate income tax expense in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes in our actual tax rate are subject to several factors, including fluctuations in operating results, new or revised tax legislation and accounting pronouncements, changes in the level of business in domestic and foreign jurisdictions, research and development tax credits, state income taxes, adjustments to valuation allowances, settlement of tax audits, and uncertain tax positions, among other items. Changes in tax laws, valuation allowances, and unanticipated tax liabilities could significantly impact our tax rate.
We recognize valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that a portion of such assets will not be realized. In making such determinations, we consider all available favorable and unfavorable evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and our ability to carry back losses to prior years. We are required to make assumptions and judgments about potential outcomes that lie outside our control. Our most sensitive and critical factors are the projection, source, and character of future taxable income. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, will be realized. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward periods are reduced.
We are subject to audits in multiple taxing jurisdictions in which we operate. These audits may involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We believe we have recognized adequate income tax provisions and reserves for uncertain tax positions.
In evaluating uncertain tax positions, we consider the relative risks and merits of positions taken in tax returns filed and to be filed, considering statutory, judicial, and regulatory guidance applicable to those positions. We make assumptions and judgments about potential outcomes that lie outside management's control. To the extent the tax authorities disagree with our conclusions and depending on the final resolution of those disagreements, our actual tax rate may be materially affected in the period of final settlement with the tax authorities.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill and intangible assets may result from our business acquisitions. Intangible assets may also result from the purchase of assets and intellectual property where we do not acquire a business. We use estimates, including estimates of useful lives of intangible assets, the amount and timing of related future cash flows, and fair values of the related operations, in determining the value assigned to goodwill and intangible assets. Our finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives based on estimated discounted cash flows. Fully amortized finite-lived intangible assets are removed from the presentation of gross intangible assets along with the related accumulated amortization. In-process research and development is considered an indefinite-lived intangible asset and is not subject to amortization until the associated projects are completed or terminated. Finite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at the asset group level when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, when events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset may be impaired, or when their useful lives are determined to be no longer indefinite.
Goodwill is assigned to our reporting units based on the expected benefit from the synergies arising from each business combination, determined by using certain financial metrics, including the forecast discounted cash flows associated with each reporting unit. Each reporting unit corresponds with its respective operating segment.
We test goodwill for impairment each year as of October 1, or more frequently should a significant impairment indicator occur. As part of the impairment test, we may elect to perform an assessment of qualitative factors. If this qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, is less than its carrying amount, or if we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment, we would then proceed with the impairment test. The impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the reporting units to their carrying amounts. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we first evaluate the long-lived assets within the reporting unit for impairment and then recognize a goodwill impairment loss in an amount equal to any excess.
Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. We forecast discounted future cash flows at the reporting unit level using risk-adjusted discount rates and estimated future revenues and operating costs, which take into consideration factors such as existing backlog, expected future 
41
Table of Contents
orders, supplier contracts, and expectations of competitive, business and economic environments. We also identify similar publicly traded companies and develop a correlation, referred to as a multiple, to apply to the operating results of the reporting units. These combined fair values are then reconciled to the aggregate market value of our common stock on the date of valuation, while considering a reasonable control premium.
Changes in market demand, fluctuations in the markets in which we operate, the volatility and decline in the worldwide equity markets, and a decline in our market capitalization could unfavorably impact the remaining carrying value of our goodwill, which could have a significant effect on our current and future results of operations and financial position.
Defined Benefit Pension Plans
We sponsor both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans for our international employees, primarily in Germany, France, India, and Indonesia. We recognize a liability for the projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets or an asset for plan assets in excess of the projected benefit obligation. We also recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognize as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) (OCI), net of tax, the actuarial gains or losses and prior service costs or credits, if any, which arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost.
Several economic assumptions and actuarial data are used in calculating the expense and obligations related to these plans. The assumptions are updated annually at December 31 and include the discount rate, the expected remaining service life, the expected rate of return on plan assets, and the rate of future compensation increases. The discount rate is a significant assumption used to value our pension benefit obligation. We determine a discount rate for our plans based on the estimated duration of each plan's liabilities. For euro denominated defined benefit pension plans, which represent 80% of our projected benefit obligation, we use discount rates with consideration of the duration of each of the plans, using a hypothetical yield curve developed from euro-denominated AA-rated corporate bond issues. These bonds are assigned different weights to adjust their relative influence on the yield curve, and the highest and lowest yielding 10% of bonds are excluded within each maturity group. The discount rate used, depending on the duration of the plans, were between 3.00% and 3.50%. The weighted average discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation for all of the plans at December 31, 2024 was 4.04%. A change of 100 basis points in the discount rate would change our projected benefit obligation by approximately $9.0 million. The financial and actuarial assumptions used at December 31, 2024 may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions and other factors. These differences could result in a significant change in the amount of pension expense recognized in future periods. 
Contingencies
A loss contingency is recognized if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of the ultimate loss. Loss contingencies that we determine to be reasonably possible, but not probable, are disclosed but not recognized. Changes in these factors and related estimates could materially affect our financial position and results of operations. Legal costs to defend against contingent liabilities are recognized as incurred.
Stock-Based Compensation
We grant various stock-based compensation awards to our officers, employees, and Board of Directors with service, performance, and market vesting conditions, including restricted stock units, phantom stock units, and unrestricted stock units (awards). Prior to December 31, 2020, stock options were also granted as part of the stock-based compensation awards. We measure and recognize compensation expense for all awards based on estimated fair values. For awards with only a service condition, we expense stock-based compensation using the straight-line method over the requisite service period for the entire award. For awards with service and performance conditions, if vesting is probable, we expense the stock-based compensation on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award. For awards with a market condition, we expense the fair value over the requisite service period.
We measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based compensation based on estimated fair values. The fair value of unrestricted stock awards with no market conditions is the market close price of our common stock on the date of grant. For restricted stock units with market conditions, the fair value is estimated at the date of award using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which includes assumptions for dividend yield and expected volatility for our common stock and the common stock for companies within the Russell 3000 index, as well as the risk-free interest rate and expected term of the awards. For phantom stock units, fair value is the market close price of our common stock at the end of each reporting period. For stock options, the fair value was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which included assumptions for the expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected term and dividend yield.

Table of Contents
In valuing our restricted stock units with a market condition and stock options, significant judgment is required in determining the expected volatility of our common stock and the expected life that individuals will hold their stock options prior to exercising. The volatility for our restricted stock units with a market condition is based on the historical volatility of our own stock and the stock for companies comprising the market index within the market condition. The expected volatility for stock options was based on the historical and implied volatility of our own common stock. The expected life of stock option grants was derived from the historical actual term of option grants and an estimate of future exercises during the remaining contractual period of the option. While volatility and estimated life are assumptions that do not bear the risk of change subsequent to the grant date, these assumptions may be difficult to measure as they represent future expectations based on historical experience. Further, our expected volatility and expected life may change in the future, which could substantially change the grant-date fair value of future awards and ultimately the expense we recognize. Actual results and future estimates may differ substantially from our current estimates.
Non-GAAP Measures
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, and constant currency. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, and other companies may define such measures differently. For a reconciliation of each non-GAAP measure to the most comparable financial measure prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, please see the table captioned Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to the Most Directly Comparable GAAP Financial Measures.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and/or as a means for determining executive compensation. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and ability to service debt by excluding certain expenses that may not be indicative of our recurring core operating results. These non-GAAP financial measures facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance, as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. Our executive compensation plans exclude non-cash charges related to amortization of intangibles and certain discrete cash and non-cash charges, such as restructuring, loss on sale of business, strategic initiative expenses, or acquisition and integration related expenses. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they provide greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and because they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to analyze the health of our business.
Non-GAAP operating expenses
 and 
non-GAAP operating income
 – We define non-GAAP operating expenses as operating expenses excluding certain expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets, restructuring, loss on sale of business, strategic initiative expenses, and acquisition and integration related expenses. We define non-GAAP operating income as operating income excluding the expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets, restructuring, loss on sale of business, strategic initiative expenses, and acquisition and integration related expenses. Acquisition and integration related expenses include costs, which are incurred to affect and integrate business combinations, such as professional fees, certain employee retention and salaries related to integration, severances, contract terminations, travel costs related to knowledge transfer, system conversion costs, and asset impairment charges. We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors because they exclude the effect of expenses that are not related to our core operating results. By excluding these expenses, we believe that it is easier for management and investors to compare our financial results over multiple periods and analyze trends in our operations. For example, in certain periods, expenses related to amortization of intangible assets may decrease, which would improve GAAP operating margins, yet the improvement in GAAP operating margins due to this lower expense is not necessarily reflective of an improvement in our core business. There are some limitations related to the use of non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP operating income versus operating expenses and operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information about the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating expense and non-GAAP operating income and evaluating non-GAAP operating expense and non-GAAP operating income together with GAAP operating expense and operating income.
Non-GAAP net income
 and 
non-GAAP diluted EPS
 – We define non-GAAP net income as net income attributable to Itron, Inc. excluding the expenses associated with amortization of intangible assets, amortization of debt placement fees, restructuring, loss on sale of business, strategic initiative expenses, acquisition and integration related expenses, and the tax effect of excluding these expenses. We define non-GAAP diluted EPS as non-GAAP net income divided by diluted weighted-average shares outstanding during the period calculated on a GAAP basis and then reduced to reflect any anti-dilutive impact of the convertible notes hedge transactions. We consider these financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors 
43
Table of Contents
for the same reasons that we use non-GAAP operating income. The same limitations described above regarding our use of non-GAAP operating income apply to our use of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP measures and evaluating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS together with GAAP net income attributable to Itron, Inc. and GAAP diluted EPS.
Adjusted EBITDA
 – We define adjusted EBITDA as net income (a) minus interest income, (b) plus interest expense, depreciation and amortization, restructuring, loss on sale of business, strategic initiative expenses, acquisition and integration related expenses, and (c) excluding income tax provision or benefit. Management uses adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure for executive compensation. A limitation to using adjusted EBITDA is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period and the measure includes some non-cash items and excludes other non-cash items. Additionally, the items that we exclude in our calculation of adjusted EBITDA may differ from the items that our peer companies exclude when they report their results. We compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of this measure to GAAP net income.
Free cash flow
 – We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used for acquisitions of property, plant and equipment. We believe free cash flow provides investors with a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing our ability to fund our operations and repay our debt. The same limitations described above regarding our use of adjusted EBITDA apply to our use of free cash flow. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts in the reconciliation.
Constant currency
 – We refer to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in our discussions of financial results, which references the differences between the foreign currency exchange rates used to translate operating results from the entity's functional currency into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. We also use the term "constant currency", which represents financial results adjusted to exclude changes in foreign currency exchange rates as compared with the rates in the comparable prior year period. We calculate the constant currency change as the difference between the current period results and the comparable prior period's results restated using current period foreign currency exchange rates.

Item 7A:    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
In the normal course of business, we are exposed to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations. As part of our risk management strategy, we may use derivative financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Our objective is to offset gains and losses resulting from these exposures with losses and gains on the derivative contracts used to hedge them, therefore reducing the impact of volatility on earnings or protecting the fair values of assets and liabilities. We use derivative contracts only to manage existing underlying exposures. Accordingly, we do not use derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes.
Interest Rate Risk
We may be exposed to interest rate risk through variable rate debt instruments, namely the multicurrency revolving line of credit. At December 31, 2024, we had no outstanding variable rate debt.
We continually monitor and assess our interest rate risk and may institute additional interest rate swaps or other derivative instruments to manage such risk in the future if we were to have variable rate debt outstanding.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
We conduct business in a number of countries. Revenues denominated in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar were 
22%
 of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared with 24% for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 30% for the year ended December 31, 2022. These transactions expose our account balances to movements in foreign currency exchange rates that could have a material effect on our financial results. Our primary foreign currency exposure relates to non-U.S. dollar denominated transactions in our international subsidiary operations, the most significant of which is the euro.
We are exposed to foreign exchange risk when we enter into non-functional currency transactions, both intercompany and third party. At each period-end, non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities are revalued with the change recognized within other income (expense) in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We enter into monthly foreign exchange forward contracts, which are not designated for hedge accounting, with the intent to reduce earnings volatility associated with currency exposures. As of December 31, 2024, a total of 
35
 contracts were offsetting our exposures from the euro, pound sterling, Indonesian rupiah, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, and various other currencies, with notional amounts ranging from 
$104,000 to $32.3 million
.
In future periods, we may use additional derivative contracts to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks.

Item 8:    Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Itron, Inc. 
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Itron, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December  31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 25, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the US federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Revenue Recognition — Revenue arrangements involving multiple performance obligations — Refer to Notes 1 and 17 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
Many of the Company’s revenue arrangements involve multiple performance obligations consisting of hardware, license of software, cloud services and Software-as-a-Service, and professional services such as software implementation services, project management services, installation services, consulting services, post-sale maintenance support, and extended or customer-specific warranties. These contracts may contain customer-specific business terms and conditions, including service level commitments, variable consideration, and terms that govern when the customer has taken control. Additionally, these contracts may be modified from time to time as the Company delivers under the contract. These customer-specific business terms and conditions and modifications may involve complex accounting considerations, including determining whether the Company has enforceable rights and obligations, whether contract modifications represent new contracts or modification of existing contracts, 
47
Table of Contents
whether certain performance obligations are distinct, and other considerations that may impact the timing of revenue recognition involving multiple performance obligations.
The evaluation of these factors is executed in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers revenue recognition framework and requires significant management judgment that could affect the amount and timing of revenue recognition over the contractual period. The computations to recognize revenue under the ASC 606 revenue recognition framework can be complex and require a significant volume of data input. Additionally, there can be complexity in the computations and entries made to record the related contract assets and liabilities at the consolidated balance sheet date. Given the challenge in auditing the judgments and computations made in determining revenue recognition for these multiple performance obligation arrangements with customer-specific business terms and conditions and modifications, we identified revenue recognition involving multiple performance obligations as a critical audit matter.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to (1) determining whether the Company has enforceable rights and obligations, whether contract modifications represent new contracts or modifications, whether certain performance obligations are distinct and other considerations that may impact the timing of revenue recognition involving multiple performance obligations and (2) the completeness and accuracy of the computations and entries used to recognize revenue involving multiple performance obligations included the following, among others:
•
We tested the effectiveness of controls over contract reviews, including management’s use of checklists and other review procedures to determine whether customer-specific business terms are evident in the contract and whether accounting conclusions regarding enforceable rights and obligations, contract modifications, distinct products and services, and other considerations that may impact the timing of revenue recognition involving multiple performance obligations are appropriately applied.
•
We tested the effectiveness of controls of computations and entries over revenue recognition involving multiple performance obligations to determine whether the computations and entries appropriately reflect the accounting conclusions for these contracts. Such controls included (1) the review of the completeness and accuracy of data input into the computations and entries and (2) the review of the mathematical accuracy of the computations and entries.
•
For a sample of contracts with customers that included existing contracts, new contracts and contract modifications, we:
–
Tested management’s identification of customer-specific terms, whether the Company had enforceable rights and obligations, whether contract modifications represented new contracts or modifications to existing contracts, whether customer-specific terms introduced new or implied performance obligations, or other factors influencing the timing, nature and amount of revenue recognized, and assessed management’s conclusions regarding accounting treatment. Our procedures included reading the selected contracts and inquiring of the Company’s operational personnel to understand the nature of the contract and its business purpose, as well as evaluating management’s conclusions.
–
Evaluated whether the identified accounting conclusions were appropriately reflected in the computations and entries over revenue recognition involving multiple performance obligations.
–
Tested the accuracy and completeness of the data used in the computations and entries to record revenue involving multiple performance obligations.
–
Tested mathematical accuracy of the computations and entries over revenue recognition involving multiple performance obligations.

ITRON, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2024 
In this Annual Report, the terms "we", "us", "our", "Itron", and the "Company" refer to Itron, Inc.
Note 1:    
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
We were incorporated in the state of Washington in 1977 and are a technology company, offering end-to-end solutions to enhance productivity and efficiency, primarily focused on utilities and municipalities around the globe. We operate under the Itron brand worldwide and manage and report under three operating segments: Device Solutions, Networked Solutions, and Outcomes. 
Financial Statement Preparation
The consolidated financial statements presented in this Annual Report include the Consolidated Statements of Operations, Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss), Consolidated Statements of Equity, and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 and the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 of Itron, Inc. and its subsidiaries, prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Examples of significant estimates include revenue recognition, warranty, restructuring, income taxes, business combinations, goodwill and intangible assets, defined benefit pension plans, contingencies, and stock-based compensation. Due to various factors affecting future costs and operations, actual results could differ materially from these estimates.

Risks and Uncertainties
Global economic impacts, such as pandemics and various ongoing conflicts around the world, may create disruption in customer demand and global supply chains, resulting in market volatility, which our management continues to monitor. In the aftermath of these types of events, global supply chains, including labor, may struggle to keep pace with rapidly changing demand. Temporary imbalance in supply and demand may create business uncertainties that include costs and availability. Efforts continue with suppliers to improve supply resiliency, including the approval of alternate sources. Additionally, inflation in our raw materials and component costs, freight charges, sanctions, tariffs, and labor costs may increase above historical levels due to, among other things, the continuing impacts of an uncertain economic environment. We may or may not be able to fully recover these increased costs through pricing actions with our customers. Currently, we have not identified any significant decrease in long-term customer demand for our products and services.
While we have limited direct business exposure in areas with current conflict, such as Ukraine and Israel, military actions globally and any resulting sanctions or tariffs could adversely affect the global economy, as well as further disrupt the supply chain. A major disruption in the global economy and supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. The extent and duration of the military action, sanctions, tariffs, and resulting market and/or supply disruptions are impossible to predict but could be substantial, and our management continues to monitor these events closely
.
Basis of Consolidation
We consolidate all entities in which we have a greater than 
50
% ownership interest or in which we exercise control over the operations. We use the equity method of accounting for entities in which we have a 
20
% to 
50
% investment and exercise significant influence. Entities in which we have less than a 
20
% investment and where we do not exercise significant influence are accounted for under the fair value method. Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated upon consolidation.
Noncontrolling Interests
In several of our consolidated international subsidiaries, we have joint venture partners, who are minority shareholders. Although these entities are not wholly owned by Itron, we consolidate them because we have a greater than 
50
% ownership interest or because we exercise control over the operations. The noncontrolling interest balance is adjusted each period to reflect the allocation of net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss) attributable to the noncontrolling interests, as shown in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss), as well as 
54
Table of Contents
contributions from and distributions to the owners. The noncontrolling interest balance in our Consolidated Balance Sheets represents the proportional share of the equity of the joint venture entities, which is attributable to the minority shareholders.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
We consider all highly liquid instruments with remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents.
Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents that are contractually restricted from operating use are classified as restricted cash and cash equivalents. We had $
1.8
 million pledged for standby letters of credit as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Accounts Receivable, net
Accounts receivable are recognized for invoices issued to customers in accordance with our contractual arrangements. Interest and late payment fees are minimal. Unbilled receivables are recognized when revenues are recognized upon product shipment or service delivery and invoicing occurs at a later date. We recognize an allowance for credit losses representing our estimate of the expected losses in accounts receivable at the date of the balance sheet based on our historical experience of bad debts, our specific review of outstanding receivables, and our review of current and expected economic conditions. Accounts receivable are written-off against the allowance when we believe an account, or a portion thereof, is no longer collectible.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out method. Cost includes raw materials and labor, plus applied direct and indirect overhead costs. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the normal course of business, minus the cost of completion, disposal and transportation.
Derivative Instruments
All derivative instruments, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value as either assets or liabilities. The fair values of our derivative instruments are determined using the fair value measurements of significant other observable inputs (Level 2), as defined by GAAP. The fair value of our derivative instruments may switch between an asset and a liability depending on market circumstances at the end of the period. We include the effect of our counterparty credit risk based on current published credit default swap rates when the net fair value of our derivative instruments is in a net asset position and the effect of our own nonperformance risk when the net fair value of our derivative instruments is in a net liability position.
For any derivative designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. For any derivative designated as a cash flow hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) (OCI) and are recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. For a hedge of a net investment, any unrealized gain or loss from the foreign currency revaluation of the hedging instrument is reported in OCI as a net unrealized gain or loss on derivative instruments. Upon termination of a net investment hedge, the net derivative gain/loss will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) until such time when earnings are impacted by a sale or liquidation of the associated operations. We classify cash flows from our derivative programs as cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Derivatives are not used for trading or speculative purposes. Our derivatives are with credit-worthy multinational commercial banks, with which we have master netting agreements; however, our derivative positions are not recognized on a net basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. There are no credit-risk related contingent features within our derivative instruments. Refer to Note 7: Derivative Financial Instruments and Note 14: Shareholders' Equity for further disclosures of our derivative instruments and their impact on OCI.
Property, Plant, and Equipment
Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally 
30
 years for buildings and improvements and 
three years
 to 
10
 years for machinery and equipment, computers and software, and furniture. Leasehold improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the term of the applicable lease, including renewable periods if reasonably certain, or over the useful lives, whichever is shorter. Construction in progress represents capital expenditures incurred for assets not yet placed in service. Costs related to internally developed software and software purchased for internal uses are capitalized and are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Repair and maintenance costs are recognized as incurred. We have no major planned maintenance activities.
55
Table of Contents
We review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. Assets held for sale are classified within other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. Gains and losses from asset disposals and impairment losses are classified within the Consolidated Statements of Operations according to the use of the asset, except those gains and losses recognized in conjunction with our restructuring activities, which are classified within restructuring expense, or impairment losses recognized in conjunction with an announced or completed sale of a business, which are classified within loss on sale of business.
Prepaid Debt Fees
Prepaid debt fees for term debt represent the capitalized direct costs incurred related to the issuance of debt and are recognized as a deduction from the carrying amount of the corresponding debt liability. We have elected to present prepaid debt fees for revolving debt within other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These costs are amortized to interest expense over the terms of the respective borrowings, including any contingent maturity or call features, using the effective interest method or the straight-line method when associated with a revolving credit facility. When debt is repaid early, the related portion of unamortized prepaid debt fees is written off and included in interest expense.
Business Combinations
On the date of acquisition, the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree are recognized at their fair values. The acquiree's results of operations are also included beginning on the date of acquisition in our consolidated results. Intangible assets that arise from contractual/legal rights, or are capable of being separated, are measured and recognized at fair value, and amortized over the estimated useful life. If practicable, assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies are measured and recognized at fair value. If not practicable, such assets and liabilities are measured and recognized when it is probable that a gain or loss has occurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The residual balance of the purchase price, after fair value allocations to all identified assets and liabilities, represents goodwill. Acquisition-related costs are recognized as incurred. Integration costs associated with an acquisition are generally recognized in periods subsequent to the acquisition date, and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties, including penalties and interest, after the measurement period are recognized as a component of the provision for income taxes. Our acquisitions may include contingent consideration, which requires us to recognize the fair value of the estimated liability at the time of the acquisition. Subsequent changes in the estimate of the amount to be paid under the contingent consideration arrangement are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
We estimate the preliminary fair value of acquired assets and liabilities as of the date of acquisition based on information available at that time utilizing either a cost or income approach. The determination of the fair value is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Contingent consideration is recognized at fair value as of the date of the acquisition with adjustments occurring after the purchase price allocation period, which could be up to one year, recognized in earnings. Changes to valuation allowances on acquired deferred tax assets that occur after the acquisition date are recognized in the provision for, or benefit from, income taxes. The valuation of these tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities is subject to further management review and may change materially between the preliminary allocation and end of the purchase price allocation period. Any changes in these estimates may have a material effect on our consolidated operating results or financial position.
Leases
We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. A lease exists when a contract conveys to the customer the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The definition of a lease embodies two conditions: (1) there is an identified asset in the contract that is land or a depreciable asset (i.e., property, plant, and equipment), and (2) the customer has the right to control the use of the identified asset. 
Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Finance leases are included in property, plant, and equipment, other long-term assets, other current liabilities, and other long-term obligations on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. We use the rate implicit in the lease agreement when readily determinable. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate, which is the estimated rate of interest we expect to pay on a collateralized basis over a similar term, based on the information available at the lease commencement date. The Operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and is reduced by lease incentives received and initial direct costs incurred. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when 
56
Table of Contents
it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
We have lease agreements that include lease and nonlease components. When nonlease components are fixed, we have elected the practical expedient to account for lease and nonlease components as a single lease component, except for leases embedded in service contracts.
All leases with a lease term that is greater than one month are subject to recognition and measurement on the balance sheet, except where we have leases in service contracts with contract manufacturers. For leases with contract manufacturers, we have elected to utilize the short-term lease exemption.
Lease expense for variable lease payments, where the timing or amount of the payment is not fixed, are recognized when the obligation is incurred. Variable lease payments generally arise in our net lease arrangements where executory and other lease-related costs are billed to Itron when incurred by the lessor.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill and intangible assets may result from our business acquisitions. Intangible assets may also result from the purchase of assets and intellectual property in a transaction that does not qualify as a business combination. We use estimates, including estimates of useful lives of intangible assets, the amount and timing of related future cash flows, and fair values of the related operations, in determining the value assigned to goodwill and intangible assets. Our finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives based on estimated discounted cash flows, generally 
three years
 to 
10
 years for core-developed technology and customer contracts and relationships. Fully amortized finite-lived intangible assets are removed from the presentation of gross intangible assets and accumulated amortization. Finite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at the asset group level when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, when events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset may be impaired, or when their useful lives are determined to be no longer indefinite.
Goodwill is assigned to our reporting units based on the expected benefit from the synergies arising from each business combination, determined by using certain financial metrics, including the forecasted discounted cash flows associated with each reporting unit. Each reporting unit corresponds with its respective operating segment. We test goodwill for impairment each year as of October 1, or more frequently should a significant impairment indicator occur. As part of the impairment test, we may elect to perform an assessment of qualitative factors. If this qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, is less than its carrying amount, or if we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment, we would then proceed with the quantitative impairment test. The impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the reporting units to their carrying amounts. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we first evaluate the long-lived assets within the reporting unit for impairment and then recognize goodwill impairment loss in an amount equal to any excess. 
Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. We forecast discounted future cash flows at the reporting unit level using risk-adjusted discount rates and estimated future revenues and operating costs, which take into consideration factors such as existing backlog, expected future orders, supplier contracts, and expectations of competitive and economic environments. We also identify similar publicly traded companies and develop a correlation, referred to as a multiple, to apply to the operating results of the reporting units. These combined fair values are then reconciled to the aggregate market value of our common stock on the date of valuation, while considering a reasonable control premium.
Contingencies
A loss contingency is recognized if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of the ultimate loss. Loss contingencies that we determine to be reasonably possible, but not probable, are disclosed but not recognized. Legal costs to defend against contingent liabilities are recognized as incurred.

Bonus Compensation
We have various employee bonus compensation plans, which provide award amounts for the achievement of financial and nonfinancial targets. If management determines it is probable that the discretionary targets will be achieved and the amounts can be reasonably estimated, a compensation accrual is recognized based on the proportional achievement of the financial and nonfinancial targets. In addition, management or the Board of Directors may decide to grant monetary bonus awards, at their discretion, and we accrue such awards when it becomes probable they will be paid.
Warranty
We offer standard warranties on our hardware products and large application software products. We accrue the estimated cost of new product warranties based on historical and projected product performance trends and costs during the warranty period. Testing of new products in the development stage helps identify and correct potential warranty issues prior to manufacturing. Quality control efforts during manufacturing reduce our exposure to warranty claims. When testing or quality control efforts fail to detect a fault in one of our products, we may experience an increase in warranty claims. We track warranty claims to identify potential warranty trends. If an unusual trend is noted, an additional warranty accrual would be recognized if the failure event is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. When new products are introduced, our process relies on historical averages of similar products until sufficient data is available. As actual experience on new products becomes available, it is used to modify the historical averages to ensure the expected warranty costs are within a range of likely outcomes. Management regularly evaluates the sufficiency of the warranty provisions and makes adjustments when necessary. The long-term warranty balance includes estimated warranty claims beyond one year. Warranty expense is classified within cost of revenues.
Restructuring
We recognize a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity under a restructuring project in the period in which the liability is incurred. Employee termination benefits considered postemployment benefits are accrued when the obligation is probable and estimable, such as benefits stipulated by human resource policies and practices or statutory requirements. If the employee must provide future service, such benefits are recognized ratably over the future service period. For contract termination costs, we recognize a liability upon the termination of a contract in accordance with the contract terms or the cessation of the use of the rights conveyed by the contract, whichever occurs later.
Asset impairments associated with a restructuring project are determined at the asset group level. An impairment may be recognized for assets that are to be abandoned, are to be sold for less than net book value, or are held for sale in which the estimated proceeds less costs to sell are less than the net book value. We may also recognize impairment on an asset group, which is held and used, when the carrying value is not recoverable and exceeds the asset group's fair value. If an asset group is considered a business, a portion of our goodwill balance is allocated to it based on relative fair value. If the sale of an asset group under a restructuring project results in proceeds that exceed the net book value of the asset group, the resulting gain is recognized within restructuring expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Defined Benefit Pension Plans
We sponsor both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans for certain international employees. We recognize a liability for the projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets. We recognize an asset when plan assets exceed the projected benefit obligation. We also recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognize as a component of OCI, net of tax, the actuarial gains or losses and prior service costs or credits, if any, which arise during the period but that are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost. If actuarial gains and losses exceed 10 percent of the greater of plan assets or plan liabilities, we amortize them over the employees' average future service period.
Stock Repurchase Plans
From time to time, we may repurchase shares of Itron common stock under programs authorized by our Board of Directors. Repurchases are made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions and in accordance with applicable securities laws. Under applicable Washington State law, shares repurchased are retired and not displayed separately as treasury stock on the financial statements; the value of the repurchased shares is deducted from common stock.
Product Revenues and Service Revenues
Product revenues include sales from standard and smart meters, systems or software, and any associated implementation and installation revenue. Service revenues include sales from post-sale maintenance support, consulting, outsourcing, and managed services.
Revenue Recognition
The majority of our revenues consist primarily of hardware sales, but may also include the license of software, software implementation services, cloud services and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), project management services, installation services, 
58
Table of Contents
consulting services, post-sale maintenance support, and extended or customer-specific warranties. We account for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance, and collectability of consideration is probable. In determining whether the definition of a contract has been met, we consider whether the arrangement creates enforceable rights and obligations, which involves evaluation of contractual terms that would allow for the customer to terminate the agreement. If the customer has the unilateral right to terminate the agreement without providing further consideration to us, the agreement would not be considered to meet the definition of a contract. 
Many of our revenue arrangements involve multiple performance obligations as our hardware and services are often sold together. Separate contracts entered into with the same customer (or related parties of the customer) at or near the same time are accounted for as a single contract when one or more of the following criteria are met:
•
The contracts are negotiated as a package with a single commercial objective.
•
The amount of consideration to be paid in one contract depends on the price or performance of the other contract: or
•
The goods or services promised in the contracts (or some goods or services promised in each of the contracts) are a single performance obligation.
Once the contract has been defined, we evaluate whether the promises in the contract should be accounted for as more than one performance obligation. This evaluation requires significant judgment, and the decision to separate the combined or single contract into multiple performance obligations could change the amount of revenue and profit recognized in a given period. Some of our contracts contain a significant service of integrating, customizing or modifying goods or services in the contract, in which case the goods or services would be combined into a single performance obligation. It is common that we may promise to provide multiple distinct goods or services, in which case we separate the contract into more than one performance obligation. If a contract is separated into more than one performance obligation, we allocate the total transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services. For goods or services where we have observable standalone sales, the observable standalone sales are used to determine the standalone selling price. For the majority of our goods and services, we do not have observable standalone sales. As a result, we estimate the standalone selling price using either the adjusted market assessment approach or the expected cost plus a margin approach. Approaches used to estimate the standalone selling price for a given good or service will maximize the use of observable inputs and considers several factors, including our pricing practices, costs to provide a good or service, the type of good or service, and availability of other transactional data, among others.
We determine the estimated standalone selling prices of goods or services used in our allocation of arrangement consideration on an annual basis or more frequently if there is a significant change in our business or if we experience significant variances in our transaction prices.
Many of our contracts with customers include variable consideration, which can include liquidated damage provisions, rebates and volume and early payment discounts. Some of our contracts with customers contain clauses for liquidated damages related to the timing of delivery or milestone accomplishments, which could become material in the event of failure to meet the contractual deadlines. At the inception of the arrangement and on an ongoing basis, we evaluate the probability and magnitude of having to pay liquidated damages. We estimate variable consideration using the expected value method, taking into consideration contract terms, historical customer behavior, and historical sales. In the case of liquidated damages, we also take into consideration progress towards meeting contractual milestones, including whether milestones have not been achieved, specified rates, if applicable, stated in the contract, and history of paying liquidated damages to the customer or similar customers. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in our judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur.
In the normal course of business, we do not accept product returns unless the item is defective as manufactured and covered by warranty. A warranty provision is estimated as deemed necessary.
Hardware revenue is recognized at a point in time. Transfer of control is typically at the time of shipment, receipt by the customer, or, if applicable, upon receipt of customer acceptance. We will recognize revenue prior to receipt of customer acceptance for hardware in cases where the customer acceptance provision is determined to be a formality. Transfer of control would not occur until receipt of customer acceptance in hardware arrangements where such provisions are subjective or where we do not have history of meeting the acceptance criteria. 
Perpetual software licenses are a right to use intellectual property and are recognized at a point in time. Transfer of control is at the point at which it is available to the customer to download and use or upon receipt of customer acceptance. In certain contracts, software licenses may be sold with implementation services that include a significant service of integrating, 
59
Table of Contents
customizing or modifying the software. In these instances, the software license is combined into single performance obligation with the implementation services and recognized over time as the implementation services are performed.
Hardware and software licenses (when not combined with professional services) are typically billed when shipped and revenue recognized at a point-in-time. As a result, the timing of revenue recognition and invoicing does not have a significant impact on contract assets and liabilities.
Professional services, which include implementation, project management, installation, and consulting services are recognized over time. We measure progress towards satisfying these performance obligations using input methods, most commonly based on the costs incurred in relation to the total expected costs to provide the service. We expect this method to best depict our performance in transferring control of services promised to the customer or represents a reasonable proxy for measuring progress. The estimate of expected costs to provide services requires judgment. Cost estimates take into consideration our historical experience and the specific scope requested by the customer and are updated quarterly. We may also offer professional services on a stand-ready basis over a specified period of time, in which case revenue would be recognized ratably over the term. Invoicing of these services is commensurate with performance and occurs on a monthly basis. As such, these services do not have a significant impact on contract assets and contract liabilities.
Cloud services and SaaS arrangements where customers have access to certain of our software within a cloud-based IT environment that we manage, host, and support are offered to customers on a subscription basis. Revenue for the cloud services and SaaS offerings are generally recognized over time, ratably over the contact term commencing with the date the services are made available to the customer. 
Professional services are typically billed monthly in arrears or as milestones are achieved. Other services, including cloud services and SaaS arrangements, are commonly billed annually upfront resulting in a contract liability.
Certain of our revenue arrangements include an extended or customer-specific warranty provision that covers all or a portion of a customer's replacement or repair costs beyond the standard warranty period. Whether or not the extended warranty is separately priced in the arrangement, such warranties are a separate good or service, and a portion of the transaction price is allocated to this extended warranty performance obligation. This revenue is recognized ratably over the extended warranty coverage period.
Hardware and software post-sale maintenance support fees are recognized ratably over the life of the related service contract. Support fees are typically billed in advance on an annual basis, resulting in a contract liability. Shipping and handling costs and incidental expenses billed to customers are recognized as revenue in the period incurred, with the associated cost charged to cost of revenues in the same period. We recognize sales, use, and value added taxes billed to our customers on a net basis consistent with the policy election permitted under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606-10-32-2A.
Payment terms with customers can vary by customer; however, amounts billed are typically payable within 
30
 to 
90
 days, depending on the destination country. We do not typically offer financing as part of our contracts with customers.
We incur certain incremental costs to obtain contracts with customers, primarily in the form of sales commissions. Where the amortization period is one year or less, we have elected to apply the practical expedient and recognize the related commissions expense as incurred. Otherwise, such incremental costs are capitalized and amortized over the contract period. Capitalized incremental costs are not material.
Product and Software Development Costs
Product and software development costs primarily include employee compensation and third-party contracting fees. We do not capitalize product development costs, and we do not generally capitalize development expenses for computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed as the costs incurred are immaterial for the relatively short period of time between technological feasibility and the completion of software development.

Stock-Based Compensation
We grant various stock-based compensation awards to our officers, employees, and Board of Directors with service, performance, and market vesting conditions, including restricted stock units, phantom stock units, and unrestricted stock units (awards). Prior to December 31, 2020, stock options were also granted as part of the stock-based compensation awards. We measure and recognize compensation expense for all awards based on estimated fair values. For awards with only a service condition, we expense stock-based compensation using the straight-line method over the requisite service period for the entire award. For awards with service and performance conditions where vesting is probable, we expense the stock-based compensation on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award. For awards with a market condition, we expense the fair value over the requisite service period. We have elected to account for forfeitures of any awards in stock-based compensation expense prospectively as they occur.
The fair value of a restricted stock unit is the market close price of our common stock on the date of grant. Restricted stock units vest over a maximum period of 
three years
. After vesting, the restricted stock units are converted into shares of our common stock on a one-for-one basis and issued to employees. Certain restricted stock units are issued under the Long-Term Performance Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement and include performance and market conditions. The final number of shares issued will be based on the achievement of financial targets and our total shareholder return relative to the Russell 3000 Index during the performance periods. Due to the presence of a market condition, we utilize a Monte Carlo valuation model to determine the fair value of the awards at the grant date. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock for the related expected term. We believe this approach is reflective of current and historical market conditions and is an appropriate indicator of expected volatility. The risk-free interest rate is the rate available as of the grant date on zero-coupon U.S. government issues with a term equal to the expected term of the award. The expected term is the remaining term of an award based on the period of time between the grant date and the date the award is expected to vest.
Phantom stock units are a form of share-based award that are indexed to our stock price and are settled in cash upon vesting and accounted for as liability-based awards. Fair value is remeasured at the end of each reporting period based on the market close price of our common stock. Phantom stock units vest over a maximum period of 
three years
. Since phantom stock units are settled in cash, compensation expense recognized over the vesting period will vary based on changes in the fair value of the awards.
The fair value of unrestricted stock awards is the market close price of our common stock on the date of grant, and the awards are deemed fully vested. We expense stock-based compensation at the date of grant for unrestricted stock awards.
The fair value of stock options was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Options to purchase our common stock were granted with an exercise price equal to the market close price of the stock on the date the Board of Directors approved the grant. Options generally became exercisable in three equal annual installments beginning 
one year
 from the date of grant and expiring 
10
 years from the date of grant. Expected volatility was based on a combination of the historical volatility of our common stock and the implied volatility of our traded options for the related expected term. We believe this combined approach was reflective of current and historical market conditions and was an appropriate indicator of expected volatility. The risk-free interest rate was the rate available as of the award date on zero-coupon U.S. government issues with a term equal to the expected term of the award. The expected term was the weighted average expected term of an award based on the period of time between the date the award was granted and the estimated date the award will be fully exercised. Factors considered in estimating the expected term included historical experience of similar awards, contractual terms, vesting schedules, and expectations of future employee behavior.
Excess tax benefits and deficiencies resulting from employee share-based payment are recognized as income tax provision or benefit in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, and as an operating activity on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
We also maintain an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) for our employees. Under the terms of the ESPP, employees can deduct up to 
10
% of eligible compensation to purchase our common stock at a 
5
% discount from the fair market value of the stock at the end of each fiscal quarter, subject to other limitations under the plan. The sale of the stock to the employees occurs at the beginning of the subsequent quarter. The ESPP is not considered compensatory, and no compensation expense is recognized for sales of our common stock to employees.

Income Taxes
We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method of accounting. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based upon anticipated future tax consequences, in each of the jurisdictions that we operate, attributable to: (1) the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases; and (2) net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured annually using 
61
Table of Contents
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves applying complex tax regulations in different tax jurisdictions to our tax positions. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax legislation and/or rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recognized to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is not more likely than not that such assets will be realized. We do not recognize tax liabilities on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested.
Foreign Exchange
Our consolidated financial statements are reported in U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities of international subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies are translated to U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date, or the last business day of the period, if applicable. Revenues and expenses for each subsidiary are translated to U.S. dollars using an average rate for the relevant reporting period. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are included, net of tax, in OCI. Gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations for monetary asset and liability balances that are not denominated in an entity's functional currency are included within other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Currency gains and losses of intercompany balances deemed to be long-term in nature or designated as a hedge of the net investment in international subsidiaries are included, net of tax, in OCI. Foreign currency losses (gains), net of hedging, of $(
1.1
) million, $
3.1
 million, and $
2.9
 million were included in other expenses, net, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.
Fair Value Measurements
For assets and liabilities measured at fair value, the GAAP fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used in different valuation methodologies, assigning the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in actively traded markets (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). Level 2 inputs consist of quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in non-active markets; and model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are corroborated by observable market data either directly or indirectly through correlation or other means. Inputs may include yield curves, volatility, credit risks, and default rates.
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280) Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, 
which amends the reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The disclosure requirements in ASU 2023-07 have been reflected in the segment disclosures within these consolidated financial statements and will be included in our interim financial reports beginning with the first quarter of 2025. See Note 16: Segment Information.
Recent Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09,
 Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, 
which amends 
Income Taxes
 (Topic 740). The FASB issued this update to improve annual basis income tax disclosures related to (1) rate reconciliation, (2) income taxes paid, and (3) other disclosures related to pretax income (or loss) and income tax expense (or benefit) from continuing operations. The effective date for this amendment is January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. These amendments are to be applied on a prospective basis; however, retrospective application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on our consolidated financial statement disclosures.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, 
Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40) Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
. The new guidance is intended to enhance transparency and disclosures by requiring public business entities to disclose additional information about specific expense categories in the notes to financial statements at interim and annual reporting periods. The ASU is effective for our annual report as of December 31, 2027, and for interim reporting periods beginning in the first quarter of 2028, with early adoption permitted. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that the adoption of this ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-04, 
Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) Induced Conversions of Convertible Debt Instruments
. The new guidance clarifies the assessment of whether a transaction should be accounted for as an induced conversion or extinguishment of convertible debt when changes are made to conversion features as part of an offer to settle the instrument. The ASU is effective beginning in 2026, with early adoption permitted. We will utilize this guidance for any future induced conversions or extinguishments of our convertible notes.

Stock-based Awards
For stock-based awards, the dilutive effect is calculated using the treasury stock method. Under this method, the dilutive effect is computed as if the awards were exercised at the beginning of the period (or at time of issuance, if later) and assumes the related proceeds were used to repurchase our common stock at the average market price during the period. Related proceeds include the amount the employee must pay upon exercise and the future compensation cost associated with the stock award. Approximately 
17,000
, 
0.3
 million, and 
0.7
 million stock-based awards were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, because they were anti-dilutive. These stock-based awards could be dilutive in future periods.
Convertible Notes and Share Hedges
2021 Notes, Warrants and Call Option Transactions
For our convertible notes issued in March 2021 (the 2021 Notes), the dilutive effect is calculated using the if-converted method. We are required, pursuant to the indenture governing the notes, to settle the principal amount in cash and may elect to settle the remaining conversion obligation (stock price in excess of conversion price) in cash, shares, or a combination thereof. Under the if-converted method, we include the number of shares required to satisfy the remaining conversion obligation, assuming all the notes were converted. The average quarterly closing prices of our common stock for the year ended December 31, 2024 were used as the basis for determining the dilutive effect on EPS. The quarterly average closing prices for our common stock did not exceed the conversion price of $
126.00
, and therefore all associated shares were anti-dilutive.
In conjunction with the issuance of the 2021 Notes, we sold warrants to purchase 
3.7
 million shares of Itron common stock. The warrants have a strike price of $
180.00
 per share. For calculating the dilutive effect of the warrants, we use the treasury stock method. With this method, we assume exercise of the warrants at the beginning of the period, or at time of issuance if later, and the issuance of common stock upon exercise. Proceeds from the exercise of the warrants are assumed to be used to repurchase shares of our stock at the average market price during the period. The incremental shares, representing the number of shares assumed to be exercised with the warrants less the number of shares repurchased, are included in diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. For periods where the warrants strike price of $
180.00
 per share is greater than the average share price of Itron stock for the period, the warrants would be anti-dilutive. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the quarterly average closing prices of our common stock did not exceed the warrant strike price and therefore 
3.7
 million shares were considered anti-dilutive.
In connection with the issuance of the 2021 Notes, we entered into privately negotiated call option contracts on our common stock (the 2021 call option transactions) with certain commercial banks. The 2021 call option transactions cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those in the 2021 Notes, approximately 
3.7
 million shares of our common stock, the same number of shares initially underlying the notes, at a strike price of approximately $
126.00
, subject to customary adjustments. The 2021 call option transactions will expire upon the maturity of the 2021 Notes, subject to earlier exercise or termination. Exercise of the 2021 call option transactions would reduce the number of shares of our common stock outstanding and therefore would be anti-dilutive.
2024 Notes and Capped Call Transactions
For our convertible notes issued in June 2024 (the 2024 Notes), the dilutive effect is calculated using the if-converted method. We are required, pursuant to the indenture governing our convertible notes, to settle the principal amount of the convertible 
63
Table of Contents
notes in cash and may elect to settle the remaining conversion obligation (stock price in excess of conversion price) in cash, shares, or a combination thereof. Under the if-converted method, we include the number of shares required to satisfy the remaining conversion obligation, assuming all the convertible notes were converted. The average quarterly closing prices of our common stock for the year ended December 31, 2024 were used as the basis for determining the dilutive effect on EPS. The quarterly average closing prices for our common stock did not exceed the conversion price of $
131.24
, and therefore all associated shares were anti-dilutive.
In connection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the 2024 capped call transactions) on our common stock with certain commercial banks. The 2024 capped call transactions cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those in the 2024 Notes, approximately 
6.1
 million shares of our common stock, the same number of shares initially underlying the convertible notes, at a strike price of approximately $
131.2353
, subject to customary adjustments. The cap price of the 2024 capped call transactions will initially be $
205.86
 per share, which represents a premium of 100% over the last reported stock price per share of the Company's common stock on June 17, 2024, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the 2024 capped call transactions. The 2024 capped call transactions will expire upon the maturity of the 2024 Notes, subject to earlier exercise or termination. Exercise of the 2024 capped call transactions would reduce the number of shares of our common stock outstanding and therefore would be anti-dilutive.

On March 1, 2024, we completed the acquisition of 
100
% of the shares Elpis2, Inc. (Elpis Squared), a privately held software and services company. The purchase resulted in the addition of intangible assets of $
15.0
 million including $
12.5
 million identified core-developed technology and $
2.5
 million of customer contracts and relationships. The core-developed technology and customer contract and relationships will be amortized over the weighted-average 
five-year
 and 
three-year
 useful lives, respectively, using the straight-line method. Refer to Note 5: Goodwill and Note 18: Business Combination for additional information.
Assumed intangible liabilities reflect the present value of the projected cash outflows for a then existing contract for which remaining costs were expected to exceed projected revenues.

On March 1, 2024, we acquired Elpis Squared. The purchase resulted in the recognition of $
19.7
 million in goodwill allocated to our Outcomes operating segment and reporting unit. In 
the fourth quarter of 
2024, a tax adjustment reduced the goodwill acquired related to Elpis Squared to $
19.3
 million.

Refer to Note 4: Intangible Assets and Liabilities and Note 18:

Business Combination for additional information on the transaction.
The accumulated goodwill impairment losses at December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $
714.9
 million. The goodwill impairment losses were originally recognized in 2011, 2013, and 2022.
We test goodwill for impairment each year as of October 1. Changes in market demand, fluctuations in the markets in which we operate, the volatility and decline in the worldwide equity markets, and a decline in our market capitalization could unfavorably impact the remaining carrying value of our goodwill, which could have a significant effect on our current and future results of operations and financial position. Based on the results of the annual impairment testing for our reporting units performed as of October 1, 2024, no adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill were required. Refer to Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further details regarding the annual goodwill impairment process.

Credit Facility
Our current credit facility, entered on January 5, 2018 (as amended, the 2018 credit facility), originally provided for committed credit facilities in the amount of $
1.2
 billion U.S. dollars. This facility now consists of a multicurrency revolving line of credit (the revolver) with a principal amount of up to $
500
 million. The revolver also contains a $
300
 million standby letter of credit sub-facility and a $
50
 million swingline sub-facility. The $
650
 million U.S. dollar term loan (the term loan) included in the original facility was fully repaid in August 2021.
The 2018 credit facility permits us and certain of our foreign subsidiaries to borrow in U.S. dollars, euros, or, with lender approval, other currencies readily convertible into U.S. dollars.
 All obligations under the 2018 credit facility are guaranteed by Itron, Inc. and material U.S. domestic subsidiaries and are secured by a pledge of substantially all of the assets of Itron, Inc. and material U.S. domestic subsidiaries. This includes a pledge of 
100
% of the capital stock of material U.S. domestic subsidiaries and up to 
66
% of the voting stock (
100
% of the non-voting stock) of first-tier foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the obligations of any foreign subsidiary who is a foreign borrower, as defined by the 2018 credit facility, are guaranteed by the foreign subsidiary and by its direct and indirect foreign parents. The 2018 credit facility includes
 debt covenants, which contain certain 
66
Table of Contents
financial thresholds and place certain restrictions on the incurrence of debt, investments, and the issuance of dividends. We were in compliance with the debt covenants under the 2018 credit facility at December 31, 2024.
Under the 2018 credit facility, we elect applicable market interest rates for both the term loan and any outstanding revolving loans. We also pay an applicable margin, which is based on our total net leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement. The applicable rates per annum may be based on either: (1) 
the LIBOR rate
 or 
EURIBOR rate
 (subject to a floor of 
0
%), plus an applicable margin, or (2) the Alternate Base Rate, plus an applicable margin. The Alternate Base Rate election is equal to the greatest of three rates: (i) 
the prime rate
, (ii) 
the Federal Reserve effective rate
 plus 
0.50
%, or (iii) 
one-month LIBOR
 plus 
1.00
%. The cessation of LIBOR occurred in June 2023
.
 On November 23, 2022, we amended the 2018 credit facility to replace the LIBOR rate with the Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as the base interest rate. On February 21, 2023, we entered into a sixth amendment to the 2018 credit facility. This amendment modified debt covenant provisions to allow for the addback of non-recurring cash expenses related to restructuring charges incurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2023. On October 13, 2023, we entered into a seventh amendment to extend the maturity date to October 18, 2026. However, that date may be advanced to December 14, 2025 if Itron does not settle or extend a sufficient portion of outstanding convertible notes detailed in the amendment. 
In addition, the amendment revises the interest cost, as follows:

On June 14, 2024, we entered into an eighth amendment of the 2018 credit facility. In contemplation of the issuance of the 2024 convertible notes, this amendment to the Credit Agreement removed the $
500
 million maximum amount of convertible notes we could offer.
At December 31, 2024, there were 
no
 outstanding loan balances under the 2018 credit facility, and 
$
46.0
 million
 was utilized by outstanding standby letters of credit, resulting in 
$
454.0
 million
 available for additional borrowings. At December 31, 2024
, 
$
254.0
 million
 was available for additional standby letters of credit under the letter of credit sub-facility, and 
no
 amounts were outstanding under the swingline sub-facility. 
Convertible Notes
2021 Notes
On March 12, 2021, we closed the sale of $
460
 million of convertible notes in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers, resulting in net proceeds to us of $
448.5
 million after deducting initial purchasers' discounts of the offering. The 2021 Notes do not bear regular interest, and the principal amount does not accrete. The 2021 Notes will mature on March 15, 2026, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed, or converted in accordance with their terms. No sinking fund is provided for the 2021 Notes.
The initial conversion rate of the 2021 Notes is 7.9365 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $
126.00
 per share. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events. In addition, upon the occurrence of a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the 2021 Notes) or upon a notice of redemption, we will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its convertible notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change or notice of redemption, as the case may be.
Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding December 15, 2025, the 2021 Notes are convertible at the option of the holders only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on June 30, 2021 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 
130
% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business-day period after any five consecutive trading-day period (the measurement period) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 
98
% of the product of the last reported sale price of the common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events; or (4) upon redemption by us. On or after December 15, 2025, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding March 15, 2026, holders of the 2021 Notes 
67
Table of Contents
may convert all or a portion of their notes at any time. Upon conversion, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount to be converted and pay and/or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being converted.
Subsequent to March 20, 2024 and prior to December 15, 2025, we may redeem for cash all or part of the 2021 Notes, at our option, if the last reported sales price of common stock has been at least 
130
% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive), including the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption, during any 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately before the date we send the related notice of the redemption. The redemption price of each convertible note to be redeemed will be the principal amount of such note, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any. Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the convertible notes), subject to a limited exception described in the indenture governing the convertible notes, holders may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a price equal to plus accrued and unpaid special interest to, but not including, the fundamental change repurchase date (as defined in the indenture governing the convertible notes).
The 2021 Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsubordinated debt and senior in right of payment to any future debt that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the convertible notes. The convertible notes will be effectively subordinated to any of our existing and future secured debt to the extent of the assets securing such indebtedness. The convertible notes will be structurally subordinated to all existing debt and any future debt and any other liabilities of our subsidiaries.
2024 Notes
On June 21, 2024, we closed the sale of $
805
 million of convertible notes in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers, resulting in net proceeds to us of $
784
 million after deducting initial purchasers' discounts of the offering. The 2024 Notes accrue interest at a rate of 
1.375
% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on January 15, 2025. The 2024 Notes mature on July 15, 2030, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed, or converted in accordance with their terms.
The initial conversion rate of the 2024 Notes is 7.6199 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $
131.24
 per share. The conversion rate of the notes is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events. In addition, upon the occurrence of a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the convertible notes) or upon a notice of redemption, we will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change or notice of redemption, as the case may be.
Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding April 15, 2030, the 2024 Notes are convertible at the option of the holders only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2024 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 
130
% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business-day period after any five consecutive trading-day period (the measurement period) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 
98
% of the product of the last reported sale price of the common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events; or (4) upon redemption by us. On or after April 15, 2030, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding July 15, 2030, holders of the notes may convert all or a portion of their notes at any time. Upon conversion, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be converted and pay and/or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being converted.
Subsequent to July 20, 2028 and prior to April 15, 2030, we may redeem for cash all or part of the 2024 Notes, at our option, if the last reported sales price of common stock has been at least 
130
% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive), including the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption, during any 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately before the date we send the related notice of the redemption. However, we may not redeem less than all of the outstanding notes unless at least $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of notes are outstanding and not called for redemption as of the time we send related redemption notices. The redemption price of each note to be redeemed will be the principal amount of such note, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any. Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the 
68
Table of Contents
2024 Notes), subject to a limited exception described in the indenture governing the notes, holders may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a price equal to plus accrued and unpaid special interest to, but not including, the fundamental change repurchase date (as defined in the indenture governing the 2024 Notes).
The 2024 Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsubordinated debt and senior in right of payment to any future debt that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the notes. The notes will be effectively subordinated to any of our existing and future secured debt to the extent of the assets securing such indebtedness. The notes will be structurally subordinated to all existing debt and any future debt and any other liabilities of our subsidiaries.

Note 7:    
Derivative Financial Instruments
As part of our risk management strategy, we use derivative instruments to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Refer to Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 14: Shareholders' Equity, and Note 15: Fair Value of Financial Instruments for additional disclosures on our derivative instruments.
Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Relationships
We are exposed to foreign exchange risk when we enter into non-functional currency transactions, both intercompany and third party. At each period-end, non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities are revalued with the change recognized within other income (expense) in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We enter into monthly foreign exchange forward contracts, which are not designated for hedge accounting, with the intent to reduce earnings volatility associated with currency exposures. As of December 31, 2024, a total of 
35

contracts were offsetting our exposures from the euro, pound sterling, Indonesian rupiah, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, and various other currencies, with notional amounts ranging from 
$
104,000
 to $
32.3
 million.
We will continue to monitor and assess our interest rate and foreign exchange risk and may institute additional derivative instruments to manage such risk in the future.
Note 8:    
Defined Benefit Pension Plans
We sponsor both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans offering death and disability, retirement, and special termination benefits for certain of our international employees, primarily in Germany, France, India, and Indonesia. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by using the projected unit credit method. The measurement date for the pension plans was December 31, 2024.

The components of net periodic benefit cost, other than the service cost component, are included in total other income (expense) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

We determine a discount rate for our plans based on the estimated duration of each plan's liabilities. For euro denominated defined benefit pension plans, which represent 
80
% of our projected benefit obligation, we use discount rates with consideration of the duration of each of the plans, using a hypothetical yield curve developed from euro-denominated AA-rated corporate bond issues. These bonds are assigned different weights to adjust their relative influence on the yield curve, and the highest and lowest yielding 10% of bonds are excluded within each maturity group. The discount rate used, depending on the duration of the plans, were between 
3.00
% and 
3.50
%. 
Our expected rate of return on plan assets is derived from a study of actual historic returns achieved and anticipated future long-term performance of plan assets, specific to plan investment asset category. While the study primarily gives consideration to recent insurers' performance and historical returns, the assumption represents a long-term prospective return.
The total accumulated benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans was $
63.5
 million and $
68.8
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Stock-Based Compensation
We grant stock-based compensation awards, including restricted stock units, phantom stock, and unrestricted stock units, under the Second Amended and Restated 2010 Stock Incentive Plan (Stock Incentive Plan). Prior to December 31, 2020, stock options were also granted as part of the stock-based compensation awards. In the Stock Incentive Plan, we have 
13,991,273
 shares of common stock authorized for issuance subject to stock splits, dividends, and other similar events, and at December 31, 2024, 
4,590,590
 shares were available for grant. We issue new shares of common stock upon the exercise of stock options or when vesting conditions on restricted stock units are fully satisfied. These shares are subject to a fungible share provision such that the authorized share available for grant under the Plan is reduced by (i) 
one
 share for every one share subject to a stock option or share appreciation right granted and (ii) 
1.7
 shares for every one share of common stock that was subject to an award other than an option or share appreciation right.
72
Table of Contents
We also award phantom stock units, which are settled in cash upon vesting and accounted for as liability-based awards, with no impact to the shares available for grant.
In addition, we maintain the ESPP, for which 
477,368
 shares of common stock were available for future issuance at December 31, 2024.
ESPP activity and stock-based grants other than stock options and restricted stock units were not significant for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.

Defined Contribution Plans
In the United States, United Kingdom, and certain other countries, we make contributions to defined contribution plans. For our U.S. employee savings plan, which represents a majority of our contribution expense, we provide a 
75
% match on the first 
6
% of the employee salary deferral, subject to statutory limitations. For our international defined contribution plans, we provide various levels of contributions, based on salary, subject to stipulated or statutory limitations.

Note 11:    
Income Taxes
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) guidance under the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) initiative aims to minimize perceived tax abuses and modernize global tax policy, including the implementation of a global minimum effective tax rate of 15%. In December 2022, the Council of the European Union adopted OECD Pillar 2 for implementation by European Union member states by December 31, 2023. The resulting legislation in most countries where Itron has significant operations is taking effect for calendar year 2024. The OECD continues to release more guidance on these rules and framework and we are evaluating the impact to our financial position. These enactments or amendments could adversely affect our tax rate and ultimately result in a negative impact on our operating results and cash flows. Based upon preliminary calculations for calendar year 2024, the Company anticipates it will meet the safe harbors in most jurisdictions, and any remaining top-up tax should be immaterial.

The remaining portion of the loss carryforwards are composed primarily of losses in various other state and foreign jurisdictions. The majority of these losses can be carried forward indefinitely. At December 31, 2024, there was a valuation allowance of $

We recognize valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that a portion of such assets will not be realized. In making such determinations, we consider all available favorable and unfavorable evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and our ability to carry back losses to prior years. We are required to make assumptions and judgments about potential outcomes that lie outside management's control. Our most sensitive and critical factors are the projection, source, and character of future taxable income. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets, net 
77
Table of Contents
of valuation allowance, will be realized. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward periods are reduced.
We do not provide U.S. deferred taxes on temporary differences related to our foreign investments that are considered permanent in duration. These temporary differences include undistributed foreign earnings of $
38.2
 million and $
30.8
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023. Foreign taxes have been provided on these undistributed foreign earnings. As a result of recent changes in U.S. tax legislation, any repatriation of these earnings would not result in additional U.S. federal income tax.
We are subject to income tax in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These reserves are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of tax audits. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve positions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate.

At December 31, 2024, we are under examination by certain tax authorities. We believe we have appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of all tax matters and do not currently anticipate that the ultimate resolution of these examinations will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, future results of operations, or cash flows.
Based upon the timing and outcome of examinations, litigation, the impact of legislative, regulatory, and judicial developments, and the impact of these items on the statute of limitations, it is reasonably possible that the related unrecognized tax benefits could change from those recognized within the next twelve months. However, at this time, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made.
We file income tax returns in various jurisdictions. We are subject to income tax examination by tax authorities in our major tax jurisdictions as follows:
Tax Jurisdiction

While the above years are subject to audit based on the local jurisdiction's statute of limitations, tax attributes carrying over into the above years may also be adjusted upon audit.
Note 12:    
Commitments and Contingencies
Guarantees and Indemnifications
We are often required to obtain standby letters of credit (LOCs) or bonds in support of our obligations for customer contracts. These standby LOCs or bonds typically provide a guarantee to the customer for our future performance, which usually covers the installation phase of a contract and may, on occasion, cover the operations and maintenance phase of outsourcing contracts.

In the event any such standby LOC or bond were called, we would be obligated to reimburse the issuer of the standby LOC or bond. As of February 25, 2025, we are not aware of any valid claims against our outstanding standby LOCs or bonds.
We generally provide an indemnification related to the infringement of any patent, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property right on software or equipment within our sales contracts, which indemnifies the customer from, and pays the resulting costs, damages, and attorney's fees awarded against a customer with respect to, such a claim provided that (a) the customer promptly notifies us in writing of the claim and (b) we have the sole control of the defense and all related settlement negotiations. We may also provide an indemnification to our customers for third-party claims resulting from damages caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of our employees/agents in connection with the performance of certain contracts. The terms of our indemnifications generally do not limit the maximum potential payments. It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements.
Legal Matters
We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims of which the outcomes are subject to significant uncertainty. Our policy is to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to legal matters, as well as ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of the liability required, if any, for these contingencies is made after an analysis of each known issue. A liability would be recognized and charged to operating expense when we determine that a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Additionally, we disclose contingencies for which a material loss is reasonably possible, but not probable.

Health Benefits
We are self-insured for a substantial portion of the cost of our U.S. employee group health insurance. We purchase insurance from a third-party, which provides individual and aggregate stop-loss protection for these costs. Each reporting period, we expense the costs of our health insurance plan including paid claims, the change in the estimate of incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims, taxes, and administrative fees (collectively, the plan costs).

Note 13:    Restructuring
2023 Projects
On February 23, 2023, our Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan (the 2023 Projects). The 2023 Projects include activities that continue Itron's efforts to optimize its global supply chain and manufacturing operations, sales and marketing organizations, and other overhead. These projects are expected to be substantially complete by early 2025.

Asset impairments are determined at the asset group level. Revenues and net operating income from the activities we have exited or will exit under the restructuring projects are not material to our operating segments or consolidated results.
Certain of Itron's employees are represented by unions or works councils, which requires consultation, and potential restructuring projects may be subject to regulatory approval, both of which could impact the timing of planned savings in certain jurisdictions.
Other restructuring costs include expenses for employee relocation, professional fees associated with employee severance, costs to exit the facilities once the operations in those facilities have ceased, and other costs associated with the liquidation of any affected legal entities. Costs associated with restructuring activities are generally presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as restructuring, except for certain costs associated with inventory write-downs, which are classified within cost of revenues, and accelerated depreciation expense, which is recognized according to the use of the asset. Restructuring expense is recognized within the Corporate unallocated segment and does not impact the results of our operating segments.
The current portions of restructuring liabilities were $
24.3
 million and $
21.0
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and are classified within other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The long-term portions of restructuring liabilities were $
17.0
 million and $
51.4
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. The long-term portions of restructuring liabilities are classified within other long-term obligations on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and include severance accruals and facility exit costs.

Shareholders' Equity
Preferred Stock
We have authorized the issuance of 
10
 million shares of preferred stock with 
no
 par value. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the affairs of the corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of any outstanding preferred stock would be entitled to be paid a preferential amount per share to be determined by the Board of Directors prior to any payment to holders of common stock. There was 
no
 preferred stock issued or outstanding at December 31, 2024 or 2023.

Stock Repurchase Programs
Effective September 19, 2024, Itron's Board of Directors authorized a repurchase up to $
100
 million of our common stock over an 18-month period (the 2024 Stock Repurchase Program). The repurchase program is intended to comply with Rule 10b-18 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We repurchased 
no
 shares under the 2024 Stock Repurchase Program. 
Effective May 11, 2023, Itron's Board of Directors authorized a repurchase up to $
100
 million of our common stock over an 18-month period (the 2023 Stock Repurchase Program). In June 2024, we repurchased 
971,534
 shares under the 2023 Stock Repurchase Program at an average price of $
102.93
 (excluding commissions) for a total of $
100.0
 million. This repurchase was completed in conjunction with the issuance of the 2024 convertible notes.
2021 Call Option Transactions 
We paid an aggregate amount of $
84.1
 million for the 2021 call option transactions. The 2021 call option transactions cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those in the 2021 Notes, approximately 
3.7
 million shares of our common stock, the same number of shares initially underlying the 2021 Notes, at a strike price of approximately $
126.00
, subject to customary adjustments. The 2021 call option transactions will expire upon the maturity of the 2021 Notes, subject to earlier exercise or termination. The 2021 call option transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilutive effect of the conversion of our 2021 Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of the converted notes, as the case may be, in the event that the market price per share of our common stock, as measured under the terms of the 2021 call option transactions, is greater than the strike price of the 2021 call option transactions. The 2021 call option transactions meet the criteria in ASC 815-40 to be classified within Stockholders' Equity, and therefore they are not revalued after their issuance.
We made a tax election to integrate the 2021 Notes and the 2021 call option transactions. We are retaining the identification statements in our books and records, together with a schedule providing the accruals on the synthetic debt instruments. The accounting impact of this tax election makes the call options deductible as original issue discount for tax purposes over the term of the 2021 Notes, and results in a $
20.6
 million deferred tax asset recognized through equity.
Warrant Transactions
In addition, concurrently with entering into the 2021 call option transactions, we separately entered into privately-negotiated warrant transactions (the warrant transactions), whereby we sold to the counterparties warrants to acquire, collectively, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, 
3.7
 million shares of our common stock at an initial strike price of $
180.00
 per share, which represents a premium of 
100
% over the public offering price in the common stock issuance. We received aggregate proceeds of $
45.3
 million from the warrant transactions with the counterparties, with such proceeds partially offsetting the costs of entering into the convertible note hedge transactions. The warrants expire in June 2026. If the market value per share of our common stock, as measured under the warrant transactions, exceeds the strike price of the warrants, the warrants will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, unless we elect, subject to certain conditions, to settle the warrants in cash. The warrants meet the criteria in ASC 815-40 to be classified within Stockholders' Equity, and therefore the warrants are not revalued after issuance.
2024 Capped Call Transactions
In connection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions on our common stock with certain commercial banks. The 2024 capped call transactions cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those in the 2024 Notes, approximately 
6.1
 million shares of our common stock, the same number of shares initially underlying the convertible notes, at a strike price of approximately $
131.2353
, subject to customary adjustments. The cap price of the 2024 capped call transactions will initially be $
205.86
 per share, which represents a premium of 100% over the last reported stock price per share of the Company's common stock on June 17, 2024, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the 2024 capped call transactions. The 2024 capped call transactions will expire upon the maturity of the 2024 Notes, subject to earlier exercise or termination.
We made a tax election to integrate the 2024 Notes and the 2024 capped call transactions. We are retaining the identification statements in our books and records, together with a schedule providing the accruals on the synthetic debt instruments. The accounting impact of this tax election makes the capped call transactions deductible as original issue discount for tax purposes over the term of the 2024 Notes, and results in a $
26.7
 million deferred tax asset recognized through equity.

Upon closing the divestiture transaction in 2022, outstanding amounts in AOCI were reclassified to net income (loss) on the sale of business with a corresponding reversal of the impairment loss originally booked in the prior period. We also substantially liquidated our legal entity in Russia during 2022 recognizing the reclassification of the currency translation adjustment from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to the disposal of the business.

The following methods and assumptions were used in estimating fair values:
Cash and cash equivalents:
 Due to the liquid nature of these instruments, the carrying amount approximates fair value (Level 1).
Credit facility - multicurrency revolving line of credit: 
The revolver is not traded publicly. The fair values, which are determined based upon a hypothetical market participant, are calculated using a discounted cash flow model with Level 2

inputs, including estimates of incremental borrowing rates for debt with similar terms, maturities, and credit profiles. Refer to Note 6: Debt for a further discussion of our debt.
Convertible notes:
 The convertible notes are not listed on any securities exchange but may be actively traded. The fair value is estimated using Level 1 inputs, as it is based on quoted prices for these instruments in active markets.
Derivatives:
 Each derivative asset and liability has a carrying value equal to fair value. The fair values of our derivative instruments are determined using the income approach and significant other observable inputs (and are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy). We have used observable market inputs based on the type of derivative and the nature of the underlying instrument. The key inputs include foreign exchange spot and forward rates, all of which are available in an active mar
ket. We have utilized the mid-market pricing convention for these inputs.
Note 16:    
Segment Information
We operate under the Itron brand worldwide and manage and report under 
three
 operating segments: Device Solutions, Networked Solutions, and Outcomes. We define these segments based on the structure in which internally reported financial information is regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) to analyze financial performance, make strategic decisions, and allocate resources. The Company's CODM is the chief executive officer. 
Segment Products
Device Solutions – 
This segment primarily includes hardware products used for measurement, control, or sensing that can have communications capability embedded for use with our broader Itron systems, i.e., hardware-based products that may be part of a complete end-to-end solution. Examples from the Device Solutions portfolio include: standard endpoints that are shipped without Itron communications, such as our standard electricity, gas, and water meters for a variety of global markets and adhering to regulations and standards within those markets, as well as our heat and allocation products; communicating meters that may be sold as part of an Itron end-to-end solution and designed to meet market requirements; and the implementation and installation of communicating and non-communicating devices.
Networked Solutions – 
This segment primarily includes a combination of communicating devices (e.g., smart meters, modules, endpoints, and sensors), network infrastructure, network design services, and associated head-end management and application software designed and sold as a complete solution for acquiring and transporting robust application-specific data. Networked Solutions includes products and software for the implementation, installation, and management of communicating devices and data networks. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) solutions supported by this segment include automated meter reading (AMR); advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) for electricity, water, and gas; distributed energy resource management (DERMs); grid edge devices; distribution automation communications; smart street lighting; smart city sensors and applications; and leak detection and applications for both gas and water systems. Our IIoT platform allows utility and smart city applications to be run and managed on a flexible multi-purpose network.
Outcomes – 
This segment primarily includes our value-added, enhanced software and services in which we enable grid edge intelligence and manage, organize, analyze, and interpret raw, anonymized data using artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistical modeling, and other analytics. This allows us to help utilities improve decision making, maximize operational profitability, engage consumers, enhance resource efficiency, improve grid resiliency and reliability, and deliver value for utilities and smart cities. Outcomes supports high-value use cases, such as data management, grid operations, distributed intelligence, AMI operations, gas distribution and safety, water operations management, revenue assurance, DERMs, energy forecasting, consumer engagement, smart payment, and fleet energy resource management. Utilities leverage these outcomes to unlock the capabilities of their networks and devices, improve the productivity of their workforce, increase the reliability of their operations, manage and optimize the proliferation of distributed energy resources (DERs), address grid complexity, and enhance the customer experience. Revenue from these offerings are primarily recurring in nature and would include any direct management of Device Solutions, Networked Solutions, and other third-parties' products on behalf of our end customers.
The CODM assesses the segments' performance primarily by using each segment's revenues and gross profit (gross margin). Intersegment revenues are minimal. Certain operating expenses are allocated to the operating segments based upon internally established allocation methodologies. Corporate operating expenses, interest income, interest expense, other income (expense), and the income tax provision (benefit) are neither allocated to the segments, nor are they included in the measure of segment performance. Goodwill impairment charges are recognized in Corporate unallocated. No asset information for reportable segments is provided to the CODM. We do not manage the performance of the segments on a balance sheet basis.

The CODM assesses revenues and gross profit for each segment predominantly in the annual budget and periodic forecasting process. The CODM considers budget-to-actual and forecast-to-actual variances for these measures when making decisions about the allocation of operating and capital resources to each segment. The CODM primarily uses segment gross profit for evaluating pricing strategy and the performance of each segment.

On January 1, 2024, total contract assets were $

 million and total contract liabilities were $
163.0
 million. On December 31, 2024, total contract assets were $
65.4
 million and total contract liabilities were $
193.0
 million. The contract assets primarily relate to contracts that include a retention clause and allocations related to contracts with multiple performance obligations. The contract liabilities primarily relate to deferred revenue, such as extended warranty and maintenance agreements. The cumulative catch-up adjustments relate to contract modifications, measure-of-progress changes, and changes in the estimate of the transaction price.

Table of Contents
Transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations
Total transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations represents committed but undelivered products and services for contracts and purchase orders at period end. Twelve-month remaining performance obligations represent the portion of total transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations that we estimate will be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. Total transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations is not a complete measure of our future revenues as we also receive orders where the customer may have legal termination rights but are not likely to terminate.
Total transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations related to contracts is approximately $
1.3
 billion for the next 
12
 months and approximately $
1.1
 billion for periods longer than 12 months. The total remaining performance obligations consist of product and service components. The service component relates primarily to maintenance agreements for which customers pay a full year's maintenance in advance, and service revenues are generally recognized over the service period. Total transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations also includes our extended warranty contracts, for which revenue is recognized over the extended warranty period, and hardware, which is recognized as units are delivered. The estimate of when remaining performance obligations will be recognized requires significant judgment.
Cost to obtain a contract and cost to fulfill a contract with a customer
Cost to obtain a contract and costs to fulfill a contract were capitalized and amortized using a systematic rational approach to align with the transfer of control of underlying contracts with customers. While amounts were capitalized, they are not material.
Disaggregation of revenue
Refer to Note 16: Segment Information and the Consolidated Statements of Operations for disclosure regarding the disaggregation of revenue into categories, which depict how revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. Specifically, our operating segments and geographical regions as disclosed, and categories for products, which include hardware and software and services, are presented.
Note 18:    Business Combination
Elpis2, Inc.
On March 1, 2024, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the shares of Elpis2, Inc. (Elpis Squared), a privately held software and services company. This acquisition provides value to Itron through the leverage of Elpis Squared's utility grid analytics, services, and operational software platforms to enhance Itron's Outcomes offerings. The acquisition was deemed a business acquisition. The sales, results of operations, and acquisition-related costs associated with the acquisition were not material.
The purchase price for this acquisition is $
34.1
 million
. The purchase price was allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, primarily 
$
15.0
 million
 in finite-lived intangible assets and 
$
19.3

 in goodwill. Since
 this was a stock acquisition, none of the goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.

Leases
We lease certain factories, service and distribution locations, offices, and equipment under operating leases. Our operating leases have initial lease terms ranging from one to 10 years, some of which include options to extend or renew the leases for up to 10 years. Certain lease agreements contain provisions for future rent increases. Our leases do not contain material residual value guarantees, and finance leases are not material.

Item 9:    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
There were no disagreements with our independent accountants on accounting and financial disclosure matters within the three year period ended December 31, 2024, or in any period subsequent to such date, through the date of this report.
Item 9A:    Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures
An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended. Based on that evaluation, the Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that as of December 31, 2024, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure the information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.
Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in 
Internal Control— Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework). Based on our evaluation under the 2013 Framework, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report that is included in this Annual Report.
Changes in internal controls over financial reporting
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended December 31, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Itron, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Itron, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 25, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
